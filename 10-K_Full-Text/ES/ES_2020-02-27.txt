PART I

Item 1.

Business

Please refer to the Glossary of Terms for definitions of defined terms and abbreviations used in this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Eversource Energy, headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut, is a public utility holding company subject to regulation by the FERC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.  We are engaged primarily in the energy delivery business through the following wholly-owned utility subsidiaries:

•

The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut;

•

NSTAR Electric Company (NSTAR Electric), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of eastern and western Massachusetts and owns solar power facilities;

•

Public Service Company of New Hampshire (PSNH), a regulated electric utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of New Hampshire;

•

NSTAR Gas Company (NSTAR Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Massachusetts;

•

Yankee Gas Services Company (Yankee Gas), a regulated natural gas utility that serves residential, commercial and industrial customers in parts of Connecticut; and

•

Eversource Aquarion Holdings, Inc. (Aquarion), a utility holding company that owns three separate regulated water utility subsidiaries and collectively serves residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection customers in parts of Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH also serve New England customers through Eversource Energy's electric transmission business. Along with NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas, each is doing business as Eversource Energy in its respective service territory.

Eversource Energy, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each report their financial results separately.  We also include information in this report on a segment basis for Eversource Energy.  Eversource Energy has four reportable segments: electric distribution, electric transmission, natural gas distribution and water distribution.  These segments represent substantially all of Eversource Energy's total consolidated revenues.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH do not report separate business segments.

ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT

Eversource Energy's electric distribution segment consists of the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, which are engaged in the distribution of electricity to retail customers in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively, and the solar power facilities of NSTAR Electric, and the generation facilities of PSNH before such facilities were sold in January and August 2018.

ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – CONNECTICUT – THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY

CL&P's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers.  As of December 31, 2019, CL&P furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.26 million customers in 149 cities and towns in Connecticut, covering an area of approximately 4,400 square miles.  CL&P does not own any electric generation facilities.

Rates

CL&P is subject to regulation by the PURA, which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.  CL&P's present general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services.  CL&P's retail rates include a delivery service component, which includes distribution, transmission, conservation, renewable energy programs and other charges that are assessed on all customers.


Under Connecticut law, all of CL&P's customers are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while CL&P remains their electric distribution company.  For those customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier, under SS rates for customers with less than 500 kilowatts of demand (residential customers and small and medium commercial and industrial customers), and LRS rates for customers with 500 kilowatts or more of demand (larger commercial and industrial customers), CL&P purchases power under standard offer contracts and passes the cost of the purchased power to customers through a combined charge on customers' bills.

The rates established by the PURA for CL&P are comprised of the following:

•

An electric GSC, which recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers that have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers.  The GSC is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

A revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the PURA of $1.099 billion effective May 1, 2018, $1.127 billion effective May 1, 2019, and $1.158 billion effective May 1, 2020.  These pre-established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement are also subject to adjustment at each of these dates in accordance with provisions of the April 2018 rate case settlement agreement.

•

A distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers, as well as ongoing operating costs to maintain the infrastructure.

•

An Electric System Improvements (ESI) charge, which collects the costs of building and expanding the infrastructure to deliver electricity to customers above the level recovered through the distribution charge.  The ESI also recovers costs associated with CL&P’s system resiliency program.  The ESI is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

An FMCC, which recovers any costs imposed by the FERC as part of the New England Standard Market Design, including locational marginal pricing, locational installed capacity payments, and any costs approved by the PURA to reduce these charges.  The FMCC has both a bypassable component and a non-bypassable component, and is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the PURA, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.  The transmission charge is adjusted periodically and reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

A CTA charge, assessed to recover stranded costs associated with electric industry restructuring such as various IPP contracts.  The CTA is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

An SBC, established to fund expenses associated with various hardship and low-income programs.  The SBC is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

A Renewable Energy Investment Charge, which is used to promote investment in renewable energy sources.  Amounts collected by this charge are deposited into the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund and administered by the Connecticut Green Bank.

•

A conservation charge, comprised of both a statutory rate and Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) established to implement cost-effective energy conservation programs and market transformation initiatives.  The conservation charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred, and reviewed by the PURA, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers through an approved adjustment to the following year’s energy conservation spending plan budget.

As required by regulation, CL&P has entered into long-term contracts for the purchase of (i) products from renewable energy facilities, which may include energy, renewable energy certificates, or capacity, (ii) capacity-related contracts with generation facilities, and (iii) contracts for peaking capacity.  Some of these contracts are subject to sharing agreements with UI, whereby CL&P is responsible for 80 percent and UI for 20 percent of the net costs or benefits.  CL&P's portion of the costs and benefits of these contracts will be paid by, or refunded to, CL&P's customers.

Distribution Rate Case

: CL&P's distribution rates were established in an April 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective May 1, 2018.


Sources and Availability of Electric Power Supply

As noted above, CL&P does not own any generation assets and purchases energy supply to serve its SS and LRS loads from a variety of competitive sources through requests for proposals.  During 2019, CL&P supplied approximately 46 percent of its customer load at SS or LRS rates while the other 54 percent of its customer load had migrated to competitive energy suppliers.  In terms of the total number of CL&P customers, this equates to 25 percent being on competitive supply, while 75 percent remain with SS or LRS.  Because this customer migration is only for energy supply service, it has no impact on CL&P's electric distribution business or its operating income.

CL&P periodically enters into full requirements contracts for SS loads for periods of up to one year.  CL&P typically enters into full requirements contracts for LRS loads every three months.  Currently, CL&P has full requirements contracts in place for 100 percent of its SS loads for the first half of 2020.  For the second half of 2020, CL&P has 70 percent of its SS load under full requirements contracts and intends to purchase an additional 30 percent of full requirements.  None of the SS load for 2021 has been procured.  CL&P has full requirements contracts in place for its LRS loads through June 2020 and intends to purchase 100 percent of full requirements for the remainder of 2020.

ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – MASSACHUSETTS – NSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY

NSTAR Electric's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers.  As of December 31, 2019, NSTAR Electric furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 1.44 million customers in Boston and 139 cities and towns in eastern and western Massachusetts, including Cape Cod, Martha's Vineyard and the greater Springfield metropolitan area, covering an aggregate area of approximately 3,200 square miles.

NSTAR Electric does not own any generating facilities that are used to supply customers and purchases its energy requirements from competitive energy suppliers.

NSTAR Electric installed and completed nineteen new solar power facilities for a total of 62 MW by the end of 2019.  These solar sites are in addition to the 8 MW of solar power facilities constructed between 2010 and 2014.  NSTAR Electric now owns, operates and maintains a total of 70 MW of solar power facilities on twenty-two sites in Massachusetts.  NSTAR Electric will sell energy from the new facilities into the ISO-NE market, with proceeds credited to customers.

Rates

NSTAR Electric is subject to regulation by the DPU, which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, acquisition of securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.  The present general rate structure for NSTAR Electric consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial and industrial services.

Under Massachusetts law, all customers of NSTAR Electric are entitled to choose their energy suppliers, while NSTAR Electric remains their electric distribution company.  NSTAR Electric purchases power from competitive suppliers on behalf of, and passes the related cost through to, its customers who do not choose a competitive energy supplier (basic service).  Electric distribution companies in Massachusetts are required to obtain and resell power to retail customers through basic service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier.  Most of the residential customers of NSTAR Electric have continued to buy their power from NSTAR Electric at basic service rates.  Most commercial and industrial customers have switched to a competitive energy supplier.

The Cape Light Compact, an inter-governmental organization consisting of the 21 towns and two counties on Cape Cod and Martha's Vineyard, serves 200,000 customers through the delivery of energy efficiency programs, consumer advocacy, competitive electricity supply and green power options.  NSTAR Electric continues to provide electric service to these customers including the delivery of power, maintenance of infrastructure, capital investment, meter reading, billing, and customer service.

The rates established by the DPU for NSTAR Electric are comprised of the following:

•

A basic service charge that represents the collection of energy costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers that have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers, including costs related to charge-offs of uncollectible energy costs from customers.  Basic service rates are reset every six months (every three months for large commercial and industrial customers).  Additionally, the DPU has authorized NSTAR Electric to recover the cost of its NSTAR Green wind contracts through the basic service charge.  Basic service costs are reconciled annually, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

A distribution charge, which includes a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge to collect the costs of building and expanding the distribution infrastructure to deliver electricity to its destination, as well as ongoing operating costs.

•

A revenue decoupling adjustment that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the DPU of $956 million on an annualized basis for 2018 and $988 million for 2019.  Annual base distribution amounts are adjusted for inflation and filed for approval by the DPU on an annual basis, until the next rate case.


•

A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.  The transmission charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

A transition charge that represents costs to be collected primarily from previously held investments in generating plants, costs related to existing above-market power contracts, and contract costs related to long-term power contract buy-outs.  The transition charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

A renewable energy charge that represents a legislatively-mandated charge to support the Massachusetts Renewable Energy Trust Fund.

•

An energy efficiency charge that represents a legislatively-mandated charge to collect costs for energy efficiency programs.  The energy efficiency charge is reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

Reconciling adjustment charges that recover certain DPU-approved costs, including pension and PBOP benefits, low income customer discounts, credits issued to net-metering facilities installed by customers, payments to solar facilities qualified under the state solar renewable energy target program, attorney general consultant expenses, long-term renewable contracts, company-owned solar facilities, vegetation management costs, credits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, grid modernization costs, and storm restoration.  These charges are reconciled annually to actual costs incurred and reviewed by the DPU, with any difference refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

NSTAR Electric has signed long-term commitments for the purchase of energy from renewable energy facilities.

Distribution Rate Case:

NSTAR Electric's distribution rates were established in a 2017 DPU-approved rate case with rates effective February 1, 2018.

Service Quality Metrics:

NSTAR Electric is subject to service quality (SQ) metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service, and could be required to pay to customers a SQ charge of up to 2.5 percent of annual transmission and distribution revenues for failing to meet such metrics.  NSTAR Electric will not be required to pay a SQ charge for its 2019 performance as the company achieved results at or above target for all of its SQ metrics in 2019.

Sources and Availability of Electric Power Supply

As noted above, NSTAR Electric does not own any generation assets (other than 70 MW of solar power facilities that produce energy that is sold into the ISO-NE market) and purchases its energy requirements from a variety of competitive sources through requests for proposals issued periodically, consistent with DPU regulations.  NSTAR Electric enters into supply contracts for basic service for approximately 45 percent

of its residential and small commercial and industrial (C&I) customers twice per year for twelve-month terms.  NSTAR Electric enters into supply contracts for basic service for 18 percent

of large C&I customers every three months.

During 2019, NSTAR Electric supplied approximately 44 percent of its residential customer load, 31 percent of its small C&I customer load, and 8 percent of its large C&I customer load at basic service rates.  The remainder of its customer load was distributed between municipal aggregation and competitive supply.  Because customer migration is limited to energy supply service, it has no impact on the delivery business or operating income of NSTAR Electric.

ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION – NEW HAMPSHIRE – PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

PSNH's distribution business consists primarily of the purchase, delivery and sale of electricity to its residential, commercial and industrial customers.  As of December 31, 2019, PSNH furnished retail franchise electric service to approximately 523,000 retail customers in 211 cities and towns in New Hampshire, covering an area of approximately 5,630 square miles.

On January 10, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its thermal generation assets pursuant to a 2017 purchase and sale agreement.  The thermal generation facilities included approximately 1,100 MW of coal, natural gas, biomass and oil-fired electricity generation facilities.  On August 26, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its hydroelectric generation assets pursuant to a separate 2017 purchase and sale agreement.  For further information, see "Generation Divestiture" below.  As of December 31, 2019, PSNH does not own any electric generation facilities.

Rates

PSNH is subject to regulation by the NHPUC, which, among other things, has jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.

Under New Hampshire law, all of PSNH's customers are entitled to choose competitive energy suppliers.  During 2019, approximately 23 percent of all of PSNH's customers (approximately 56 percent of load) were taking service from competitive energy suppliers.


The rates established by the NHPUC for PSNH are comprised of the following:

•

A default energy service charge recovers energy-related costs incurred as a result of providing electric generation service supply to all customers that have not migrated to competitive energy suppliers.  Through March 31, 2018, the default energy service charge recovered the costs of PSNH's generation, as well as purchased power, and included an allowed ROE of 9.81 percent.  Effective April 1, 2018, as a result of the completion of the divestiture of its non-hydro generation assets, PSNH purchased power for retail customers who had not chosen a competitive supplier through a periodic market solicitation with the rate set to recover the cost of that power, statutorily mandated renewable portfolio standard costs and the continued cost associated with the ownership of the Hydro generation units until the completion of the divestiture of the hydro units in August 2018.  Effective September 1, 2018, any remaining costs from ownership of generation are recovered as part of the SCRC described below.

•

A distribution charge, which includes kilowatt-hour and/or demand-based charges to recover costs related to the maintenance and operation of PSNH's infrastructure to deliver power to its destination, as well as power restoration and service costs.  It also includes a customer charge to collect the cost of providing service to a customer; such as the installation, maintenance, reading and replacement of meters and maintaining accounts and records.

•

A transmission charge that recovers the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generating plants to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.

•

An SCRC, which allows PSNH to recover its stranded costs, including above-market expenses incurred under mandated power purchase obligations, other long-term investments and obligations, and the remaining costs associated with the 2018 sales of its generation facilities.

•

An SBC, which funds energy efficiency programs for all customers, as well as assistance programs for residential customers within certain income guidelines.

PSNH has signed long-term commitments for the purchase of energy from renewable energy facilities.

The default energy service charge and SCRC rates change semi-annually and the transmission and SBC rates change annually.  These rates are reconciled annually in accordance with the policies and procedures of the NHPUC, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

Distribution Rate Case:

PSNH distribution rates were last established in a settlement approved by the NHPUC in 2010.  Prior to the expiration of that settlement on June 30, 2015, the NHPUC approved the continuation of those rates, and increased funding via rates, of PSNH's reliability enhancement program.

On April 26, 2019, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for approval of a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of approximately $33 million, effective July 1, 2019.  On June 27, 2019, the NHPUC approved a settlement agreement that was reached by PSNH, the NHPUC Staff, the Office of the Consumer Advocate, and another settling party, to implement a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of $28.3 million.  Although new rates were implemented on August 1, 2019 to customers, the provisions of the temporary base distribution rate increase were effective July 1, 2019.  The settlement agreement also permits PSNH to recover approximately $68.5 million in unrecovered storm costs over a five-year period beginning August 1, 2019, with debt carrying charges, which is included in the temporary rate increase.

On May 28, 2019, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for a permanent increase in base distribution rates of approximately $70 million, effective July 1, 2020, which includes the temporary rate increase request.  The temporary rates are subject to reconciliation based on the outcome of the permanent rate case now before the NHPUC.  The NHPUC is permitted up to twelve months to adjudicate the permanent rate application from the date of filing.  A decision by the NHPUC is expected in the second quarter of 2020.

Generation Divestiture

In June 2015, Eversource and PSNH entered into the 2015 Public Service Company of New Hampshire Restructuring and Rate Stabilization Agreement, pursuant to which PSNH agreed to divest its generation assets, subject to NHPUC approval.  The NHPUC approved this agreement as well as the final divestiture plan and auction process in 2016.  On October 11, 2017, PSNH entered into two Purchase and Sale Agreements with private investors, one to sell its thermal generation assets at a purchase price of $175 million, subject to adjustment, (the “Thermal Agreement”) and a second to sell its hydroelectric generation assets at a purchase price of $83 million, subject to adjustment (the “Hydro Agreement”).  The NHPUC approved these agreements in late November 2017.

On January 10, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its thermal generation assets pursuant to the Thermal Agreement.  In accordance with the Thermal Agreement, the original purchase price of

$175 million

was adjusted to reflect working capital adjustments, closing date adjustments and proration of taxes and fees prior to closing, totaling $40.9 million.  In the second quarter of 2018, the purchase price was further adjusted by $17.3 million relating to the valuation of certain allowances.  As a result of these adjustments, net proceeds from the sale of the thermal assets totaled

$116.8 million

.


On July 16, 2018, FERC issued its order approving the transfer of PSNH's six hydroelectric licenses to private investors.  On August 26, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its hydroelectric generation assets pursuant to the Hydro Agreement.  In accordance with the Hydro Agreement, the original purchase price of

$83 million

was adjusted to reflect contractual adjustments totaling

$5.8 million

, resulting in net proceeds of

$77.2 million

.  The difference between the carrying value of the hydroelectric generation assets and the sale proceeds resulted in a gain of

$17.3 million

.  An estimated gain from the sale of these assets was included as an offset to the total remaining costs associated with the sale of generation assets that were securitized on May 8, 2018.

On May 8, 2018, PSNH Funding issued $635.7 million of securitized RRBs pursuant to a finance order issued by the NHPUC on January 30, 2018 to recover remaining costs resulting from the divestiture of PSNH’s generation assets, which included the deferred costs resulting from the sale of the thermal generation assets.  These RRBs are secured by a non-bypassable charge recoverable from PSNH customers.  PSNH recorded regulatory assets and other deferred costs in connection with the generation asset divestiture and the securitization of remaining costs, which are probable of recovery through collection of the non-bypassable charge.

On November 27, 2019, PSNH filed a motion for the commencement of audit of divestiture-related costs.  PSNH’s actual balance of costs eligible for recovery as divestiture-related costs is $654.0 million, which is above the $635.7 million amount securitized in May 2018.  PSNH proposed to recover this balance through the SCRC tracker mechanism and believes the amount deferred is probable of recovery.

Sources and Availability of Electric Power Supply

PSNH does not own any generation assets and purchases energy supply from a variety of competitive suppliers for its energy service customers through requests for proposals issued twice per year, for six-month terms, for approximately 78 percent of its residential and small C&I customers and for 14 percent of its large C&I customers.

During 2019, PSNH supplied approximately 43 percent of its customer load at default energy service rates while the other 57 percent of its customer load had migrated to competitive energy suppliers.  Because this customer migration is only for energy supply service, it has no impact on PSNH’s electric distribution business or its operating income.

ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION SEGMENT

Each of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH owns and maintains transmission facilities that are part of an interstate power transmission grid over which electricity is transmitted throughout New England.  Each of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, and most other New England utilities, are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's transmission facilities and the rules by which they acquire transmission services.  Under these arrangements, ISO-NE, a non-profit corporation whose board of directors and staff are independent of all market participants, serves as the regional transmission organization of the New England transmission system.

Wholesale Transmission Rates

Wholesale transmission revenues are recovered through FERC-approved formula rates.  Annual transmission revenue requirements include recovery of transmission costs and include a return on equity applied to transmission rate base.  Transmission revenues are collected from New England customers, including distribution customers of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  The transmission rates provide for an annual true-up of estimated to actual costs.  The financial impacts of differences between actual and estimated costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, transmission customers.

FERC ROE Complaints

Four separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively the "Complainants").  In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of

11.14 percent

that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate


-month complaint periods.  In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of

10.57 percent

and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of

11.74 percent

, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable.

In response to appeals of the FERC decision in the first complaint filed by the NETOs and the Complainants, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court) issued a decision on April 14, 2017 vacating and remanding the FERC's decision.  On October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court. FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE.


On November 21, 2019, FERC issued an order concerning the transmission ROEs for the Midcontinent ISO transmission owners (MISO).  In that order, FERC adopted another new methodology for determining base ROEs for MISO, which differed significantly from the methodology and framework set forth in its October 16, 2018 FERC order on the NETOs’ ROE dockets.  On December 23, 2019, the NETOs filed a Supplemental Paper Hearing Brief and a Motion to supplement the record in the NETO ROE dockets to respond to the new methodology proposed in the MISO order, as there is uncertainty to whether it may be applied to the NETOs’ cases.  On January 21, 2020, the FERC issued an order granting rehearing for further consideration to give the FERC more time to act on the substantive issues of the MISO ROE proceedings.  Further changes to the methodology by FERC are possible as a result of the arguments in both the MISO and NETO proceedings.  Given the significant uncertainty relating to the October 2018 FERC order, the November 2019 FERC order to MISO, and the FERC's rehearing of the MISO order, the Company is unable to predict the potential effect of the MISO order on the NETO complaints or the outcome of the four complaints and concluded that there is no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaint periods at this time.  Further, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of gain or loss for any of the four complaint proceedings.

Transmission Projects

During 2019, we were involved in the planning, development and construction of a series of electric transmission projects that will be built within the next two years and that will enhance system reliability and improve capacity.  For more information on transmission projects, see "Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Electric Transmission Business" in the accompanying Item 7,

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

.

Northern Pass was Eversource's planned

1,090

MW HVDC transmission line that would have interconnected from the Québec-New Hampshire border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire.  As a result of a final decision received on July 19, 2019 from the New Hampshire Supreme Court, whereby the court denied Northern Pass’ appeal and affirmed the NHSEC’s denial of Northern Pass’ siting application on NPT, Eversource concluded that construction of NPT was no longer probable and that there was no constructive path forward for the project.  Eversource terminated the project and permanently abandoned any further development.  As a result, substantially all of the capitalized project costs, which totaled

$318 million

, certain of which are subject to cost reimbursement agreements, were impaired.  For further information, see "Critical Accounting Policies - Impairment of Northern Pass Transmission" in the accompanying Item 7,

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Transmission Rate Base

Transmission rate base under our FERC-approved tariff primarily consists of our investment in transmission net utility plant less accumulated deferred income taxes.

Under our FERC-approved tariff, and with the exception of transmission projects that received specific FERC approval to include CWIP in rate base, transmission projects generally enter rate base after they are placed in commercial operation.  At the end of 2019, our estimated transmission rate base was approximately $7.3 billion, including approximately $3.3 billion at CL&P, $2.9 billion at NSTAR Electric, and $1.1 billion at PSNH.

NATURAL GAS DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT

NSTAR Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 300,000 customers in 51 communities in central and eastern Massachusetts covering 1,067 square miles, and Yankee Gas distributes natural gas to approximately 241,000 customers in 72 cities and towns in Connecticut covering 2,187 square miles.  Total throughput (sales and transportation) in 2019 was approximately 73.5 Bcf for NSTAR Gas and 58.4 Bcf for Yankee Gas.  Our natural gas businesses provide firm natural gas sales and transportation service to eligible retail customers who require a continuous natural gas supply throughout the year, such as residential customers who rely on natural gas for heating, hot water and cooking needs, as well as commercial and industrial customers that rely on natural gas for space heating, hot water, cooking and commercial and industrial applications.

A portion of the storage of natural gas supply for NSTAR Gas during the winter heating season is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp., an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource Energy.  NSTAR Gas has access to Hopkinton LNG Corp. facilities in Hopkinton, Massachusetts consisting of a LNG liquefaction and vaporization plant and three above-ground cryogenic storage tanks having an aggregate capacity of 3.0 Bcf of liquefied natural gas. NSTAR Gas also has access to Hopkinton LNG Corp. facilities in Acushnet, Massachusetts that include additional storage capacity of 0.5 Bcf. Total vaporization capacity of these facilities is 0.21 Bcf per day.  Yankee Gas owns a 1.2 Bcf LNG facility in Waterbury, Connecticut, which also has the ability to liquefy and vaporize up to 0.1 Bcf per day.  This facility is used primarily to assist Yankee Gas in meeting its supplier-of-last-resort obligations and also enables it to provide economic supply and make economic refill of natural gas, typically during periods of low demand.


NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas generate revenues primarily through the sale and/or transportation of natural gas.  While all NSTAR Gas customers have the ability to choose to transport natural gas, in the past year, transportation represented only approximately three percent of the total residential load, while transportation represented approximately 58 percent of the total commercial and industrial load.  Retail natural gas service in Connecticut is partially unbundled: residential customers in Yankee Gas' service territory buy natural gas supply and delivery only from Yankee Gas while commercial and industrial customers may choose their natural gas suppliers.  Firm transportation service is offered to customers who purchase natural gas from sources other than NSTAR Gas or Yankee Gas.  NSTAR Gas has the ability to offer interruptible transportation and interruptible natural gas sales service to high volume commercial and industrial customers. Yankee Gas offers interruptible transportation and interruptible natural gas sales service to commercial and industrial customers that have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel on short notice.  NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas can interrupt service to these customers during peak demand periods or at any other time to maintain distribution system integrity.

Rates

NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas are subject to regulation by the DPU and the PURA, respectively, which, among other things, have jurisdiction over rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.

Retail natural gas delivery and supply rates are established by the DPU and the PURA and are comprised of:

•

A distribution charge consisting of a fixed customer charge and a demand and/or energy charge that collects the costs of building, maintaining, and expanding the natural gas infrastructure to deliver natural gas supply to its customers.  This also includes collection of ongoing operating costs.

•

A seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause (CGAC) at NSTAR Gas that collects natural gas supply costs, pipeline and storage capacity costs, costs related to charge-offs of uncollected energy costs and working capital related costs.  The CGAC is reset semi-annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following corresponding season.  In addition, NSTAR Gas files interim changes to its CGAC factor when the actual costs of natural gas supply vary from projections by more than five percent.

•

A local distribution adjustment clause (LDAC) at NSTAR Gas that collects all energy efficiency and related program costs, environmental costs, pension and PBOP related costs, attorney general consultant costs, credits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, gas system enhancement program (GSEP) costs and costs associated with low income customers.  The LDAC is reset annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following period and provides for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers.

•

A Revenue Decoupling Mechanism (RDM) at NSTAR Gas that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the DPU in 2015.  The pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement is also subject to adjustment in accordance with provisions of the November 2015 NSTAR Gas distribution rate case.

•

A Purchased Gas Adjustment (PGA) clause, which is evaluated monthly and allows Yankee Gas to recover the costs of the procurement of natural gas for its firm and seasonal customers.  Differences between actual natural gas costs and collection amounts on August 31st of each year are deferred and then recovered from, or refunded to, customers during the following year.  Carrying charges on outstanding balances are calculated using Yankee Gas' weighted average cost of capital in accordance with the directives of the PURA.

•

A Conservation Adjustment Mechanism (CAM) at Yankee Gas, which allows 100 percent recovery of conservation costs through this mechanism including program incentives to promote energy efficiency, as well as recovery of any lost revenues associated with implementation of energy conservation measures.  A reconciliation of CAM revenues to expenses is performed annually with any difference being recovered from, or refunded to, customers with carrying charges during the following year.

•

A Gas System Improvement (GSI) reconciliation mechanism at Yankee Gas, which collects the costs of certain Distribution Integrity Management Program (DIMP) and core capital plant in service above and beyond the level that is recovered through the distribution charge.  The GSI is adjusted and reconciled annually, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

A RDM at Yankee Gas that reconciles annual base distribution rate recovery amounts recovered from customers to the pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement approved by the PURA effective January 1, 2019, January 1, 2020 and January 1, 2021. The pre-established level of baseline distribution delivery service revenue requirement is also subject to adjustment at each of these dates in accordance with provisions of the 2018 rate case settlement agreement.

•

A System Expansion Rate (SER) Reconciliation Mechanism at Yankee Gas, which compares distribution system expansion investment costs and revenues for new customers, with the level projected in current distribution customer rates.  This reconciliation is performed annually and customer rates are adjusted accordingly.


NSTAR Gas purchases financial contracts based on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas futures in order to reduce cash flow variability associated with the price for approximately one-third of its normal winter season natural gas supplies.  These purchases are made under a program approved by the DPU in 2006.  This practice attempts to minimize the impact of fluctuations in natural gas prices to NSTAR Gas' firm natural gas customers.  These financial contracts do not procure natural gas supply.  All costs incurred or benefits realized when these contracts are settled are included in the CGAC.

NSTAR Gas is subject to SQ metrics that measure safety, reliability and customer service and could be required to pay to customers a SQ charge of up to 2.5 percent of annual distribution revenues for failing to meet such metrics.  NSTAR Gas will not be required to pay a SQ charge for its 2019 performance as it achieved results at or above target for all of its SQ metrics in 2019.

Distribution Rate Case:

On November 8, 2019, NSTAR Gas filed its application with the DPU, which sought a distribution rate increase of $38.0 million effective October 1, 2020.  As part of this filing, NSTAR Gas also proposed to continue its ongoing Gas System Enhancement Program (GSEP), include the GSEP investments since 2015 into base rates, and implement a performance-based ratemaking plan.  A final decision from the DPU is expected by September 30, 2020.

Yankee Gas distribution rates were set in a December 2018 PURA approved rate case settlement agreement, with rates effective November 15, 2018.  The 2018 Yankee Gas settlement agreement required Yankee Gas to implement a Distribution Integrity Management Program (DIMP) cost recovery mechanism to further invest capital to replace aging infrastructure. The DIMP mechanism allows for recovery of costs associated with capital additions of approximately $26 million to $37 million annually, which is incremental to the $150 million included in base distribution rate base per year.  The settlement agreement also provides Yankee Gas the opportunity to seek recovery of additional capital spending above these levels with PURA approval.  PURA ordered an accelerated replacement program for Yankee Gas to fully replace its cast iron and bare steel facilities in 11 years and fully replace copper services and certain steel mains and services in 14 years.  Yankee Gas was also authorized to continue its ongoing natural gas system expansion program, implement a revenue decoupling rate mechanism, and recover merger costs.  The settlement agreement included a regulatory ROE of 9.3 percent.  In addition, the distribution rates charged to customers were adjusted to reflect the prospective impacts of the lower federal corporate income tax rate, the overcollection of the lower income tax rate from January 1, 2018, and the EDIT from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  Although new rates were effective January 1, 2019, the provisions of the settlement agreement took effect November 15, 2018.

Natural Gas Replacement and Expansion

Massachusetts:  Pursuant to Massachusetts legislation, in October of each year, NSTAR Gas files the GSEP with the DPU for the following construction year.  NSTAR Gas' program accelerates the replacement of certain natural gas distribution facilities in the system to less than 25 years.  The GSEP includes a tariff that provides NSTAR Gas an opportunity to collect the costs for the program on an annual basis through a reconciling factor.  On April 30th each year, the DPU approves the GSEP rate recovery factor that goes into effect on May 1st.

NSTAR Gas' distribution rate case application filed on November 8, 2019 included a proposal to include GSEP additions through 2018 into base distribution rates and to continue the operation of the GSEP mechanism for GSEP investments made after 2018.  In addition, the filing included a proposal for a customer connection surcharge, which would be used to reduce up-front contribution in aid of construction (CIAC) costs for customers seeking to connect to the company’s distribution system.  A final decision from the DPU is expected by September 30, 2020.

Connecticut:  Yankee Gas' December 2018 PURA approved rate case settlement agreement included an accelerated pipeline replacement cost recovery program.  The Gas System Improvement (“GSI”) rate recovers accelerated pipeline replacement as well as other capital investment through an annual reconciliation.  The Company filed its first GSI reconciliation on March 1, 2019 for rates effective April 1, 2019 and will continue to file annually on March 1 for rates effective April 1.

In 2013, in accordance with Connecticut law and regulations, the PURA approved a comprehensive joint natural gas infrastructure expansion plan (the "Expansion Plan") filed by Yankee Gas and other Connecticut natural gas distribution companies.  In January 2015, the PURA approved a joint settlement agreement proposed by Yankee Gas and other Connecticut natural gas distribution companies and regulatory agencies that clarified the procedures and oversight criteria applicable to the Expansion Plan.  Yankee Gas received approval from PURA for its 2014, 2015 and 2016 System Expansion Reconciliations.  Yankee Gas filed its 2017 and 2018 System Expansion Reconciliations in March 2018 and March 2019, respectively.  Yankee Gas is now awaiting an order and does not anticipate any material changes to its 2017 and 2018 Reconciliations.

Sources and Availability of Natural Gas Supply

NSTAR Gas maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, market area storage and peaking services.  NSTAR Gas purchases transportation, storage, and balancing services from Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company and Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, as well as other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions in the U.S., including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent region, and Appalachian Shale supplies to the final delivery points in the NSTAR Gas service area.  NSTAR Gas purchases all of its natural gas supply under a firm, competitively bid annual portfolio management contract.  In addition to the firm transportation and natural gas storage supplies discussed above, NSTAR Gas utilizes on-system LNG facilities to meet its winter peaking demands.  These LNG facilities are located within NSTAR Gas' distribution system and are used to liquefy and store pipeline natural gas during the warmer months for vaporization and use during the heating season.  During the summer injection season, excess pipeline capacity and supplies are used to deliver and store natural gas in market area underground storage facilities located in Maryland and Pennsylvania.  Stored natural gas is withdrawn during the winter season to supplement flowing pipeline supplies in order to meet firm heating demand.  NSTAR Gas has firm underground storage contracts and total storage capacity entitlements of approximately 6.6 Bcf, of which 3.5 Bcf LNG storage is provided by Hopkinton LNG Corp. in facilities located in Hopkinton and Acushnet, Massachusetts.


The PURA requires Yankee Gas to meet the needs of its firm customers under all weather conditions.  Specifically, Yankee Gas must structure its supply portfolio to meet firm customer needs under a design day scenario (defined as the coldest day in 30 years) and under a design year scenario (defined as the average of the four coldest years in the last 30 years).  Yankee Gas also maintains a flexible resource portfolio consisting of natural gas supply contracts, transportation contracts on interstate pipelines, off-system storage and its on-system 1.2 Bcf LNG storage facility to meet consumption needs during the coldest days of winter.  Yankee Gas obtains its interstate capacity from the three interstate pipelines that directly serve Connecticut: the Algonquin, Tennessee and Iroquois Pipelines, which connect to other upstream pipelines that transport natural gas from major natural gas producing regions, including the Gulf Coast, Mid-continent, Canadian regions and Appalachian Shale supplies.

Based on information currently available regarding projected growth in demand and estimates of availability of future supplies of pipeline natural gas, each of NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas believes that in order to meet the long-term firm customer requirements in a reliable manner will necessitate a combination of pipeline, storage, and non-pipeline solutions.

WATER DISTRIBUTION SEGMENT

Eversource Water Ventures, Inc., a Connecticut corporation, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Eversource Aquarion Holdings, Inc. (Aquarion), operates three separate regulated water utilities in Connecticut (Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, or “AWC-CT”), Massachusetts (Aquarion Water Company of Massachusetts, or “AWC-MA”) and New Hampshire (Aquarion Water Company of New Hampshire, or “AWC-NH”).  These regulated companies provide water services to approximately 229,000 residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and fire protection and other customers, in 60 towns and cities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  As of December 31, 2019, approximately 87 percent of Aquarion’s customers were based in Connecticut.

Rates

Aquarion's water utilities are subject to regulation by the PURA, the DPU and the NHPUC in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, respectively.  These regulatory agencies have jurisdiction over, among other things, rates, certain dispositions of property and plant, mergers and consolidations, issuances of long-term securities, standards of service and construction and operation of facilities.

Aquarion’s general rate structure consists of various rate and service classifications covering residential, commercial, industrial, and municipal and fire protection services.

The rates established by the PURA, DPU and NHPUC are comprised of the following:

•

A base rate, which is comprised of fixed charges based on meter/fire connection sizes, as well as volumetric charges based on the amount of water sold.  Together these charges are designed to recover the full cost of service resulting from a general rate proceeding.

•

In Connecticut, a revenue adjustment mechanism (“RAM”) that reconciles earned revenues, with certain allowed adjustments, on an annual basis, to the revenue requirement approved by the PURA in AWC-CT’s last rate case (2013), which is an annual amount of $178.0 million.

•

In Connecticut and New Hampshire, a water infrastructure conservation adjustment (“WICA”) charge, and in Massachusetts an annual main replacement adjustment mechanism (“MRAM”) charge, which is applied between rate case proceedings and seeks recovery of allowed costs associated with eligible infrastructure improvement projects placed in-service. The WICA is updated semi-annually in Connecticut and annually in New Hampshire, with any differences refunded to, or recovered from, customers.

•

In Massachusetts, treatment plant surcharges, which are a series of three surcharges (one fixed and two volumetric in nature) that are designed to recover certain operating costs and the costs of the lease of the treatment plant located in Hingham.  These surcharges are applicable only to customers in Hingham, Hull and Cohasset.

Sources and Availability of Water Supply

Our water utilities obtain their water supplies from owned surface water sources (reservoirs) and groundwater supplies (wells) with a total supply yield of approximately 131 million gallons per day, as well as water purchased from other water suppliers.  Approximately 99 percent of our annual production is self-supplied and processed at 10 surface water treatment plants and numerous well stations, which are all located in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.

The capacities of Aquarion’s sources of supply, and water treatment, pumping and distribution facilities, are considered sufficient to meet the present requirements of Aquarion’s customers under normal conditions.  On occasion, drought declarations are issued for portions of Aquarion’s service territories in response to extended periods of dry weather conditions.

OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS

Eversource's offshore wind business includes ownership interests in North East Offshore and Bay State Wind, which together hold power purchase agreements (PPAs) and contracts for the Revolution Wind, South Fork Wind and Sunrise Wind projects, as well as offshore leases through the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM).  Our offshore wind projects are being developed and constructed through a joint and equal partnership with Ørsted.  This partnership also participates in opportunities for solicitations for offshore wind energy in the Northeast U.S.


On February 8, 2019, Eversource and Ørsted entered into an equal partnership to acquire key offshore wind assets in the Northeast.  Eversource has a 50 percent ownership interest in North East Offshore, which holds the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects, as well as a 257 square-mile lease off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  Eversource also has a 50 percent ownership interest in Bay State Wind, which holds the Sunrise Wind project.  Bay State Wind's separate 300-square-mile ocean lease is located approximately 25 miles south of the coast of Massachusetts adjacent to the North East Offshore area.  In aggregate, the Bay State Wind and the North East Offshore lease sites jointly-owned by Eversource and Ørsted could eventually develop at least 4,000 MW of clean, renewable offshore wind energy.

Revolution Wind is a 704 MW offshore wind power project located approximately 15 miles south of the Rhode Island coast, and South Fork Wind is a 130 MW offshore wind power project located approximately 35 miles east of Long Island.  Sunrise Wind is an 880 MW offshore wind facility, which will be developed 35 miles east of Montauk Point, Long Island.  The completion dates for these projects are subject to federal permitting through BOEM, engineering, state siting and permitting in New York and Rhode Island, and finalizing a PPA amendment in New York.  For more information on these projects, see "Business Development and Capital Expenditures – Offshore Wind Business" in the accompanying Item 7,

NATURAL GAS TRANSMISSION PROJECT

Access Northeast was a natural gas pipeline and storage project jointly owned by Eversource, Enbridge, Inc. (Enbridge) and National Grid plc (National Grid), through Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC (AGT).  In 2018, management determined that the future cash flows of the Access Northeast project were uncertain and could no longer be reasonably estimated and that the book value of our equity method investment was not recoverable.  As a result, Eversource recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $32.9 million pre-tax within Other Income, Net on our statement of income in 2018, which represented the full carrying value of our equity method investment.  On April 1, 2019, in accordance with a provision of the AGT LLC operating agreement, the Access Northeast project was terminated.  For further information, see "Critical Accounting Policies - Access Northeast" in the accompanying Item 7,

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

PROJECTED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

We project to make capital expenditures of

$14.19 billion

from


through


, of which we expect

$8.63 billion

to be in our electric and natural gas distribution segments,

$3.98 billion

to be in our electric transmission segment and

$0.69 billion

to be in our water distribution segment.  We also project to invest

$0.90 billion

in information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements.  These projections do not include any expected investments related to our offshore wind partnership.

FINANCING

Our credit facilities and indentures require that Eversource parent and certain of its subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas, and Aquarion, comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants as are customarily included in such agreements, including maintaining a ratio of consolidated debt to total capitalization of no more than 65 percent.  All of these companies currently are, and expect to remain, in compliance with these covenants.

As of

December 31, 2019

,

$296.1 million

of Eversource's long-term debt, including

$95.0 million

,

$50.0 million

,

$150.0 million

, and

$1.1 million

for NSTAR Electric, Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and Aquarion, respectively, will mature within the next 12 months.

NUCLEAR FUEL STORAGE

CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH, and several other New England electric utilities are stockholders in three inactive regional nuclear generation companies, CYAPC, MYAPC and YAEC (collectively, the Yankee Companies).  The Yankee Companies have completed the physical decommissioning of their respective nuclear power facilities and are now engaged in the long-term storage of their spent nuclear fuel.  The Yankee Companies fund these costs through litigation proceeds received from the DOE and, to the extent necessary, through wholesale, FERC-approved rates charged under power purchase agreements with several New England utilities, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, in turn recover these costs from their customers through state regulatory commission-approved retail rates.  The Yankee Companies collect amounts that we believe are adequate to recover the remaining plant closure and fuel storage cost estimates for the respective plants.  We believe CL&P and NSTAR Electric will recover their shares of these obligations from their customers.  PSNH has recovered its total share of these costs from its customers.

We consolidate the assets and obligations of CYAPC and YAEC on our consolidated balance sheet because our ownership and voting interests are more than 50 percent of each of these companies.

OTHER REGULATORY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

General

We are regulated in virtually all aspects of our business by various federal and state agencies, including FERC, the SEC, and various state and/or local regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over the industry and the service areas in which each of our companies operates, including the PURA, which has jurisdiction over CL&P, Yankee Gas, and Aquarion, the NHPUC, which has jurisdiction over PSNH and Aquarion, and the DPU, which has jurisdiction over NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas, and Aquarion.


Environmental Regulation

We are subject to various federal, state and local requirements with respect to water quality, air quality, toxic substances, hazardous waste and other environmental matters.  Additionally, major generation and transmission facilities may not be constructed or significantly modified without a review of the environmental impact of the proposed construction or modification by the applicable federal or state agencies.

Renewable Portfolio Standards

Each of the states in which we do business also has Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS) requirements, which generally require fixed percentages of our energy supply to come from renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, landfill gas, fuel cells and other similar sources.

New Hampshire's RPS provision requires increasing percentages of the electricity sold to retail customers to have direct ties to renewable sources.  In 2019, the total RPS obligation was 19.7 percent and it will ultimately reach 25.2 percent in 2025.  The costs of the RECs are recovered by PSNH through rates charged to customers.

Similarly, Connecticut's RPS statute requires increasing percentages of the electricity sold to retail customers to have direct ties to renewable sources.  In 2019, the total RPS obligation was 27.5 percent

and will ultimately reach 48 percent in 2030.  CL&P is permitted to recover any costs incurred in complying with RPS from its customers through its GSC

rate.

Massachusetts' RPS program also requires electricity suppliers to meet renewable energy standards.  For 2019, the requirement was 24.94 percent, and will ultimately reach 38.96 percent in 2025.  NSTAR Electric is permitted to recover any costs incurred in complying with RPS from its customers through rates.  NSTAR Electric also owns renewable solar power facilities.  The RECs generated from NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities are sold to other energy suppliers, and the proceeds from these sales are credited back to customers.

Hazardous Materials Regulations

We have recorded a liability for what we believe, based upon currently available information, is our reasonably estimable environmental investigation, remediation, and/or Natural Resource Damages costs for waste disposal sites for which we have probable liability.  Under federal and state law, government agencies and private parties can attempt to impose liability on us for recovery of investigation and remediation costs at hazardous waste sites.  As of December 31,


, the liability recorded for our reasonably estimable and probable environmental remediation costs for known sites needing investigation and/or remediation, exclusive of recoveries from insurance or from third parties, was

$81.0 million

, representing


sites.  These costs could be significantly higher if additional remediation becomes necessary or when additional information as to the extent of contamination becomes available.

The most significant liabilities currently relate to future clean-up costs at former MGP facilities.  These facilities were owned and operated by our predecessor companies from the mid-1800's to mid-1900's.  By-products from the manufacture of natural gas using coal resulted in fuel oils, hydrocarbons, coal tar, purifier wastes, metals and other waste products that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment.  We currently have partial or full ownership responsibilities at former MGP sites that have a reserve balance of

$67.9 million

of the total

$81.0 million

as of December 31,


.  MGP costs are recoverable through rates charged to our customers.

Electric and Magnetic Fields

For more than twenty years, published reports have discussed the possibility of adverse health effects from electric and magnetic fields (EMF) associated with electric transmission and distribution facilities and appliances and wiring in buildings and homes.  Although weak health risk associations reported in some epidemiology studies remain unexplained, most researchers, as well as numerous scientific review panels, considering all significant EMF epidemiology and laboratory studies, have concluded that the available body of scientific information does not support the conclusion that EMF affects human health.

In accordance with recommendations of various regulatory bodies and public health organizations, we reduce EMF associated with new transmission lines by the use of designs that can be implemented without additional cost or at a modest cost.  We do not believe that other capital expenditures are appropriate to minimize unsubstantiated risks.

Global Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emission Issues

Global climate change and greenhouse gas emission issues have received an increased focus from state governments and the federal government.  The EPA initiated a rulemaking addressing greenhouse gas emissions and, on December 7, 2009, issued a finding that concluded that greenhouse gas emissions are "air pollution" that endangers public health and welfare and should be regulated.  The EPA has mandated greenhouse gas emission reporting beginning in 2011 for emissions for certain aspects of our business including volume of gas supplied to large customers and fugitive emissions of SF6 gas and methane.

We are continually evaluating the regulatory risks and regulatory uncertainty presented by climate change concerns.  Such concerns could potentially lead to additional rules and regulations that impact how we operate our general utility business.  These could include federal "cap and trade" laws, carbon taxes, and fuel and energy taxes.  We expect that any costs of these rules and regulations would be recovered from customers.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

In addition to the matters set forth under "Safe Harbor Statement Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995" included immediately prior to Item 1,

Business,

above, we are subject to a variety of significant risks.  Our susceptibility to certain risks, including those discussed in detail below, could exacerbate other risks. These risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our risk profile.

Cyberattacks, including acts of war or terrorism, targeted directly on or indirectly affecting our systems or the systems of third parties on which we rely, could severely impair operations, negatively impact our business, lead to the disclosure of confidential information and adversely affect our reputation.

A successful cyberattack on the information technology systems that control our transmission and distribution systems or other assets could impair or prevent us from managing these systems and facilities, operating our systems effectively, or properly managing our data, networks and programs. The breach of certain information technology systems could adversely affect our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information. A major cyber incident could result in significant expenses to investigate and to repair system damage or security breaches and could lead to litigation, fines, other remedial action, heightened regulatory scrutiny and damage to our reputation.

We have instituted safeguards to protect our information technology systems and assets. We devote substantial resources to network and application security, encryption and other measures to protect our computer systems and infrastructure from unauthorized access or misuse and interface with numerous external entities to improve our cybersecurity situational awareness. The FERC, through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), requires certain safeguards to be implemented to deter cyberattacks. These safeguards may not always be effective due to the evolving nature of cyberattacks. We maintain cyber insurance to cover damages and defense costs related to breaches of networks or operational technology, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses.

Any such cyberattacks could result in loss of service to customers and a significant decrease in revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Strategic development opportunities associated with offshore wind or investment opportunities in electric transmission or clean-energy opportunities may not be successful, and projects may not commence operation as scheduled or be completed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects.

We are pursuing broader strategic development investment opportunities that will benefit the Northeast region related to the construction of offshore wind electric generation facilities, and investment opportunities in electric transmission facilities and other clean-energy infrastructure. The development of these activities involves numerous significant risks around schedule, cost, capacity factors, tax strategies and permitting (both on and offshore). Various external factors could result in increased costs or result in delays or cancellation of these projects. Risks include both federal and state regulatory approval processes, new legislation impacting the industry, changes to federal income tax laws, economic events or factors, environmental and community concerns, design and siting issues, difficulties in obtaining required rights of way, competition from incumbent utilities and other entities, and actions of our strategic partners. Should any of these factors result in significant delays or cancellations, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected, or our future growth opportunities may not be realized as anticipated.


Eversource has a joint and equal partnership with Ørsted for the development and operation of three offshore wind projects. Offshore wind is currently an emerging industry in the U.S., but it has a very robust operational and construction history in Europe.  As such, siting, permitting, tax legislation, and supply chain are currently being addressed for the first time in the U.S.  The projects currently being developed by our partnership may not achieve the results we anticipate. The partnership’s ability to generate revenue from offshore wind projects depends on meeting our construction schedules, controlling cost overruns, maintaining continuing interconnection arrangements, power purchase agreements, or other market mechanisms as well as interconnecting utility and Regional Transmission Organizations rules, policies, procedures and FERC tariffs that permit future offshore wind project operations. After projects are placed in operation, capacity factors will directly affect revenues generated from these investments. Other factors that may have an adverse impact on our anticipated project returns include significant schedule delays resulting from federal, state or local permitting processes.  Specifically, the approval from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is a critical path item in the projects' timeline.  Any changes to tax laws or to Eversource’s ability to monetize tax attributes associated with these projects could also have a material adverse effect on cash flows and project returns.

As a result of legislative and regulatory changes, the states in which we provide service have implemented new selection procedures for new major electric transmission, offshore wind and other clean energy facilities. These procedures require the review of competing projects and permit the selection of only those projects that are expected to provide the greatest benefit to customers. If the projects in which we have invested are not selected for construction, or even if our projects are selected, then legislative or regulatory actions could result in our projects not being probable of entering the construction phase, which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Physical attacks, including acts of war or terrorism, both threatened and actual, could adversely affect our ability to operate our systems and could adversely affect our financial results and liquidity.

Physical attacks, including acts of war or terrorism, both threatened and actual, that damage our transmission and distribution systems or other assets could negatively impact our ability to transmit or distribute energy, water, natural gas, or operate our systems efficiently or at all. Because our electric transmission systems are part of an interconnected regional grid, we face the risk of widespread blackouts due to grid disturbances or disruptions on a neighboring interconnected system.  Similarly, our natural gas distribution system is connected to transmission pipelines, not owned by Eversource, if there was an attack on the transmission pipelines, it could impact our ability to deliver natural gas.  If our assets were physically damaged and were not recovered in a timely manner, it could result in a loss of service to customers, a significant decrease in revenues, significant expense to repair system damage, costs associated with governmental actions in response to such attacks, and liability claims, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We maintain property and liability insurance, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses.

The actions of regulators and legislators can significantly affect our earnings, liquidity and business activities.

The rates that our electric, natural gas and water companies charge their customers are determined by their state regulatory commissions and by the FERC. These commissions also regulate the companies' accounting, operations, the issuance of certain securities and certain other matters. The FERC also regulates the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at wholesale, accounting, issuance of certain securities and certain other matters, including reliability standards through NERC.

Under state and federal law, our electric, natural gas and water companies are entitled to charge rates that are sufficient to allow them an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred operating and capital costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, to attract needed capital and maintain their financial integrity, while also protecting relevant public interests. Each of these companies prepares and submits periodic rate filings with their respective regulatory commissions for review and approval, which allows for various entities to challenge our current or future rates, structures or mechanisms and could alter or limit the rates we are allowed to charge our customers and may not match the timing of when costs are incurred. Additionally, a catastrophic event not involving Eversource could result in our regulators and legislators imposing additional requirements that may lead to additional costs for the Company.

There is no assurance that regulators will approve the recovery of all costs incurred by our electric, natural gas and water companies, including costs for construction, operation and maintenance, as well as a reasonable return on their respective regulated assets. The amount of costs incurred by the companies, coupled with increases in fuel and energy prices, could lead to consumer or regulatory resistance to the timely recovery of such costs, thereby adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

The FERC has jurisdiction over our transmission costs recovery and our allowed ROEs. Certain outside parties have filed four complaints against all electric companies under the jurisdiction of ISO-NE alleging that our allowed ROEs are unjust and unreasonable. An adverse decision in any of these four complaints could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

FERC's policy has encouraged competition for transmission projects, even within existing service territories of electric companies. Implementation of FERC's goals, including within our service territories, may expose us to competition for construction of transmission projects, additional regulatory considerations, and potential delay with respect to future transmission projects, which may adversely affect our results of operations and lower rate base growth.

Changes in tax laws, as well as the potential tax effects of business decisions could negatively impact our business, results of operations (including our expected project returns from our planned offshore wind facilities), financial condition and cash flows.


We outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business, reputation and results of operations.

We outsource certain services to third parties in areas including information technology, transaction processing, human resources, payroll and payroll processing and other operational areas. Outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to substandard quality of service delivery or substandard deliverables, which may result in missed deadlines or other timeliness issues, non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards) or reputational harm, which could negatively impact our results of operations. We also continue to pursue enhancements to standardize our systems and processes. If any difficulties in the operation of these systems were to occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations, or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators, unions, customers or employees.

The effects of climate change, including severe storms, could cause significant damage to any of our facilities requiring extensive expenditures, the recovery for which is subject to approval by regulators.

Climate change creates physical and financial risks to our operations. Physical risks from climate change may include an increase in sea levels and changes in weather conditions, such as changes in precipitation and extreme weather events including drought. Customers’ energy needs vary with weather conditions, primarily temperature and humidity. For residential customers, heating and cooling represent their largest energy use. For water customers, conservation measures imposed by the communities we serve could impact water usage. To the extent weather conditions are affected by climate change, customers’ energy and water usage could increase or decrease depending on the duration and magnitude of the changes.

Severe weather, such as ice and snow storms, hurricanes, droughts, and other natural disasters, may cause outages and property damage, which may require us to incur additional costs that may not be recoverable from customers. The cost of repairing damage to our operating subsidiaries' facilities and the potential disruption of their operations due to storms, natural disasters or other catastrophic events could be substantial, particularly as regulators and customers demand better and quicker response times to outages. If, upon review, any of our state regulatory authorities finds that our actions were imprudent, some of those restoration costs may not be recoverable from customers. The inability to recover a significant amount of such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We maintain property insurance, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses.

Our transmission and distribution systems may not operate as expected, and could require unplanned expenditures, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Our ability to properly operate our transmission and distribution systems is critical to the financial performance of our business. Our transmission and distribution businesses face several operational risks, including the breakdown, failure of, or damage to operating equipment, information technology systems, or processes, especially due to age; labor disputes; disruptions in the delivery of electricity, natural gas and water; increased capital expenditure requirements, including those due to environmental regulation; catastrophic events such as fires, explosions, a solar event, an electromagnetic event, or other similar occurrences; extreme weather conditions beyond equipment and plant design capacity; human error; and potential claims for property damage or personal injuries beyond the scope of our insurance coverage. Many of our transmission projects are expected to alleviate identified reliability issues and reduce customers' costs. However, if the in-service date for one or more of these projects is delayed due to economic events or factors, or regulatory or other delays, the risk of failures in the electricity transmission system may increase. Any failure of our transmission and distribution systems to operate as planned may result in increased capital costs, reduced earnings or unplanned increases in operation and maintenance costs. The inability to recover a significant amount of such costs could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

New technology and alternative energy sources could adversely affect our operations and financial results.

Advances in technology that reduce the costs of alternative methods of producing electric energy to a level that is competitive with that of current electric production methods, could result in loss of market share and customers, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive. These changes in technology could also alter the channels through which electric customers buy or utilize energy, which could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses. Economic downturns or periods of high energy supply costs typically can lead to the development of legislative and regulatory policy designed to promote reductions in energy consumption and increased energy efficiency and self-generation by customers.

Contamination of our water supplies, the failure of dams on reservoirs providing water to our customers, or requirements to repair, upgrade or dismantle any of these dams, may disrupt our ability to distribute water to our customers and result in substantial additional costs, which could adversely affect our financial condition, and results of operations.

Our water supplies, including water provided to our customers, are subject to possible contamination from naturally occurring compounds or man-made substances.

Our water systems include impounding dams and reservoirs of various sizes. Although we believe our dams are structurally sound and well-maintained, significant damage to these facilities, or a significant decrease in the water in our reservoirs, could adversely affect our ability to provide water to our customers until the facilities and a sufficient amount of water in our reservoirs can be restored. A failure of a dam could result in personal injuries and downstream property damage for which we may be liable. The failure of a dam would also adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers. Any losses or liabilities incurred due to a failure of one of our dams may not be recoverable in rates and may have a


material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We maintain liability insurance, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses.

The unauthorized access to and the misappropriation of confidential and proprietary customer, employee, financial or system operating information could adversely affect our business operations and adversely impact our reputation.

In the regular course of business, we, and our third-party suppliers, maintain sensitive customer, employee, financial and system operating information. We are required by various federal and state laws to safeguard this information. Cyber intrusions, security breaches, theft or loss of this information by cybercrime or otherwise could lead to the release of critical operating information or confidential customer or employee information, which could adversely affect our business operations or adversely impact our reputation, and could result in significant costs, fines and litigation. We maintain cyber insurance to cover damages and defense costs arising from unauthorized disclosure of, or failure to protect, private information, as well as costs for notification to, or for credit monitoring of, customers, employees and other persons in the event of a breach of private information. This insurance covers amounts paid to avert, prevent or stop a network attack or the disclosure of personal information, and costs of a qualified forensics firm to determine the cause, source and extent of a network attack or to investigate, examine and analyze our network to find the cause, source and extent of a data breach, but it may be insufficient to cover all losses. While we have implemented measures designed to prevent network attacks and mitigate their effects should they occur, these measures may not be effective due to the continually evolving nature of efforts to access confidential information.

Our counterparties may not meet their obligations to us or may elect to exercise their termination rights, which could adversely affect our earnings.

We are exposed to the risk that counterparties to various arrangements that owe us money, have contracted to supply us with energy or other commodities or services, or that work with us as strategic partners, including on significant capital projects, will not be able to perform their obligations, will terminate such arrangements or, with respect to our credit facilities, fail to honor their commitments. Should any of these counterparties fail to perform their obligations or terminate such arrangements, we might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at higher market prices and/or have to delay the completion of, or cancel, a capital project. Should any lenders under our credit facilities fail to perform, the level of borrowing capacity under those arrangements could decrease. In any such events, our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows could be adversely affected.

Our goodwill is recorded at an amount that, if impaired and written down, could adversely affect our future operating results and total capitalization.

We have a significant amount of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet, which, as of December 31,


, totaled

$4.4 billion

.  The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. We test our goodwill balances for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events occur, or circumstances change that would indicate a potential for impairment. A determination that goodwill is deemed to be impaired would result in a non-cash charge that could materially adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and total capitalization. The annual goodwill impairment test in


resulted in a conclusion that our goodwill was not impaired.

We are exposed to significant reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to increased regulatory oversight or other sanctions.

Because utility companies, including our electric, natural gas and water utility subsidiaries, have large customer bases, they are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of their distribution services and the speed with which they are able to respond to electric outages, natural gas leaks and similar interruptions caused by storm damage or other unanticipated events. Adverse publicity of this nature could harm our reputation and the reputation of our subsidiaries; may make state legislatures, utility commissions and other regulatory authorities less likely to view us in a favorable light; and may cause us to be subject to less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight. Unfavorable regulatory outcomes can include more stringent laws and regulations governing our operations, such as reliability and customer service quality standards or vegetation management requirements, as well as fines, penalties or other sanctions or requirements.

Limits on our access to, and increases in, the cost of capital may adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan.

We use short-term debt and the long-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity and funding for capital requirements not obtained from our operating cash flow. If access to these sources of liquidity becomes constrained, our ability to implement our business strategy could be adversely affected. In addition, higher interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, which could adversely impact our results of operations. A downgrade of our credit ratings or events beyond our control, such as a disruption in global capital and credit markets, could increase our cost of borrowing and cost of capital or restrict our ability to access the capital markets and negatively affect our ability to maintain and to expand our businesses.

Costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, may increase and have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Our subsidiaries' operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental statutes, rules and regulations that govern, among other things, water quality, water discharges, the management of hazardous and solid waste, and air emissions. Compliance with these requirements requires us to incur significant costs relating to environmental monitoring, maintenance and upgrading of facilities, remediation and permitting.


The costs of compliance with existing legal requirements or legal requirements not yet adopted may increase in the future. An increase in such costs, unless promptly recovered, could have an adverse impact on our business and our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

Other Regulatory and Environmental Matters

, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The loss of key personnel, the inability to hire and retain qualified employees, or the failure to maintain a positive relationship with our workforce could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Our operations depend on the continued efforts of our employees. Retaining key employees and maintaining the ability to attract new employees are important to both our operational and financial performance. We cannot guarantee that any member of our management or any key employee at the Eversource parent or subsidiary level will continue to serve in any capacity for any particular period of time. In addition, a significant portion of our workforce in our subsidiaries, including many workers with specialized skills maintaining and servicing the electric, natural gas and water infrastructure, will be eligible to retire over the next five to ten years. Such highly skilled individuals cannot be quickly replaced due to the technically complex work they perform. We have developed strategic workforce plans to identify key functions and proactively implement plans to assure a ready and qualified workforce, but we cannot predict the impact of these plans on our ability to hire and retain key employees. Labor disputes, work stoppages or an inability to negotiate future collective bargaining agreements on commercially reasonable terms, as well as the intentional misconduct of employees or contractors, may also have an adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

Market performance or changes in assumptions may require us to make significant contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans.

We provide a defined benefit pension plan and other postretirement benefits for a substantial number of employees, former employees and retirees. Our future pension obligations, costs and liabilities are highly dependent on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include estimated investment returns, interest rates, discount rates, health care cost trends, benefit changes, salary increases and the demographics of plan participants. If our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, our future costs could increase significantly.

In addition, various factors, including underperformance of plan investments and changes in law or regulation, could increase the amount of contributions required to fund our pension plan in the future. Additional large funding requirements, when combined with the financing requirements of our construction program, could impact the timing, amounts, and number of future financings and negatively affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

As a holding company with no revenue-generating operations, Eversource parent's liquidity is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries, its commercial paper program, and its ability to access the long-term debt and equity capital markets.

Eversource parent is a holding company and as such, has no revenue-generating operations of its own. Its ability to meet its debt service obligations and to pay dividends on its common shares is largely dependent on the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to, or repay borrowings from, Eversource parent, and/or Eversource parent's ability to access its commercial paper program or the long-term debt and equity capital markets. Prior to funding Eversource parent, the subsidiary companies have financial obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, their operating expenses, debt service, preferred dividends of certain subsidiaries, and obligations to trade creditors.  Should the subsidiary companies not be able to pay dividends or repay funds due to Eversource parent, or if Eversource parent cannot access its commercial paper programs or the long-term debt and equity capital markets, Eversource parent's ability to pay interest, dividends and its own debt obligations would be restricted.

Item 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments

Franchises

CL&P

Subject to the power of alteration, amendment or repeal by the General Assembly of Connecticut and subject to certain approvals, permits and consents of public authority and others prescribed by statute, CL&P has, subject to certain exceptions not deemed material, valid franchises free from burdensome restrictions to provide electric transmission and distribution services in the respective areas in which it is now supplying such service.

In addition to the right to provide electric transmission and distribution services as set forth above, the franchises of CL&P include, among others, limited rights and powers, as set forth under Connecticut law and the special acts of the General Assembly constituting its charter, to manufacture, generate, purchase and/or sell electricity at retail, including to provide Standard Service, Supplier of Last Resort service and backup service, to sell electricity at wholesale and to erect and maintain certain facilities on public highways and grounds, all subject to such consents and approvals of public authority and others as may be required by law. The franchises of CL&P include the power of eminent domain.  Connecticut law prohibits an electric distribution company from owning or operating generation assets.  However, under "An Act Concerning Electricity and Energy Efficiency," enacted in 2007, an electric distribution company, such as CL&P, is permitted to purchase an existing electric generating plant located in Connecticut that is offered for sale, subject to prior approval from the PURA and a determination by the PURA that such purchase is in the public interest.

NSTAR Electric

Through its charter, which is unlimited in time, NSTAR Electric has the right to engage in the business of delivering and selling electricity within its respective service territory, and has the power incidental thereto and is entitled to all the rights and privileges of and subject to the duties imposed upon electric companies under Massachusetts laws.  The locations in public ways for electric transmission and distribution lines are obtained from municipal and other state authorities who, in granting these locations, act as agents for the state.  In some cases, the actions of these authorities are subject to appeal to the DPU.  The rights to these locations are not limited in time and are subject to the action of these authorities and the legislature.  Under Massachusetts law, no other entity may provide electric delivery service to retail customers within NSTAR Electric service territory without the written consent of NSTAR Electric.  This consent must be filed with the DPU and the municipality so affected.  The franchises of NSTAR Electric include the power of eminent domain, obtained through application to the DPU.

The Massachusetts restructuring legislation defines service territories as those territories actually served on July 1, 1997 and following municipal boundaries to the extent possible.  The restructuring legislation further provides that until terminated by law or otherwise, distribution companies shall have the exclusive obligation to serve all retail customers within their service territories and no other person shall provide distribution service within such service territories without the written consent of such distribution companies.

PSNH

The NHPUC, pursuant to statutory requirements, has issued orders granting PSNH exclusive franchises to distribute electricity in the respective areas in which it is now supplying such service.

In addition to the right to distribute electricity as set forth above, the franchises of PSNH include, among others, rights and powers to manufacture, generate, purchase, and transmit electricity, to sell electricity at wholesale to other utility companies and municipalities and to erect and maintain certain facilities on certain public highways and grounds, all subject to such consents and approvals of public authority and others as may be required by law.  PSNH's status as a public utility gives it the ability to petition the NHPUC for the right to exercise eminent domain for distribution services and for transmission eligible for regional cost allocation.

PSNH is also subject to certain regulatory oversight by the Maine Public Utilities Commission and the Vermont Public Utility Commission.

NSTAR Gas

Through its charter, which is unlimited in time, NSTAR Gas has the right to engage in the business of delivering and selling natural gas within its respective service territory, and has the power incidental thereto and is entitled to all the rights and privileges of and subject to the duties imposed upon natural gas companies under Massachusetts laws.  The locations in public ways for natural gas distribution pipelines are obtained from municipal and other state authorities who, in granting these locations, act as agents for the state.  In some cases, the actions of these authorities are subject to appeal to the DPU.  The rights to these locations are not limited in time and are subject to the action of these authorities and the legislature.  Under Massachusetts law, no other entity may provide natural gas delivery service to retail customers within the NSTAR Gas service territory without the written consent of NSTAR Gas.  This consent must be filed with the DPU and the municipality so affected.

Yankee Gas

Yankee Gas holds valid franchises to sell natural gas in the areas in which Yankee Gas supplies natural gas service, which it acquired either directly or from its predecessors in interest.  Generally, Yankee Gas holds franchises to serve customers in areas designated by those franchises as well as in most other areas throughout Connecticut so long as those areas are not occupied and served by another natural gas utility under a valid franchise of its own or are not subject to an exclusive franchise of another natural gas utility or by consent.  Yankee Gas' franchises are perpetual but remain subject to the power of alteration, amendment or repeal by the General Assembly of the State of Connecticut, the power of revocation by the PURA and certain approvals, permits and consents of public authorities and others prescribed by statute.  Generally, Yankee Gas' franchises include, among other rights and powers, the right and power to manufacture, generate, purchase, transmit and distribute natural gas and to erect and maintain certain facilities on public highways and grounds, and the right of eminent domain, all subject to such consents and approvals of public authorities and others as may be required by law.

Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut

AWC-CT derives its rights and franchises to operate from special acts of the Connecticut General Assembly and subject to certain approvals, permits and consents of public authority and others prescribed by statute and by its charter, AWC-CT has, with minor exceptions, solid franchises free from burdensome restrictions and unlimited as to time, and is authorized to sell potable water in the towns (or parts thereof) in which water is now being supplied by AWC-CT.


In addition to the right to sell water as set forth above, the franchises of AWC-CT include rights and powers to erect and maintain certain facilities on public highways and grounds, all subject to such consents and approvals of public authority and others as may be required by law.  Under the Connecticut General Statutes, AWC-CT may, upon payment of compensation, take and use such lands, springs, streams or ponds, or such rights or interests therein as the Connecticut Superior Court, upon application, may determine is necessary to enable AWC-CT to supply potable water for public or domestic use in its franchise areas.

Aquarion Water Company of Massachusetts

Through its charters, which are unlimited in time, AWC-MA has the right to engage in the business of distributing and selling water within its service territories, and has the power incidental thereto and is entitled to all the rights and privileges of and subject to the duties imposed upon water companies under Massachusetts laws.  AWC-MA has the right to construct and maintain its mains and distribution pipes in and under any public ways and to take and hold water within its respective service territories. Subject to DPU regulation, AWC-MA has the right to establish and fix rates for use of the water distributed and to establish reasonable regulations regarding the same.  Certain of the towns within our service area have the right, at any time, to purchase the corporate property and all rights and privileges of AWC-MA according to pricing formulas and procedures specifically described in AWC-MA's respective charters and in compliance with Massachusetts law.

Aquarion Water Company of New Hampshire

The NHPUC, pursuant to statutory law, has issued orders granting and affirming AWC-NH’s exclusive franchise to own, operate, and manage plant and equipment and any part of the same, for the conveyance of water for the public located within its franchise territory.  That franchise territory encompasses the towns of Hampton, North Hampton and Rye.  Subject to NHPUC’s regulations, AWC-NH has the right to establish and fix rates for use of the water distributed and to establish reasonable regulations regarding the same.

In addition to the right to provide water supply, the franchise also allows AWC-NH to sell water at wholesale to other water utilities and municipalities and to construct plant and equipment and maintain such plant and equipment on certain public highways and grounds, all subject to such consents and approvals of public authority and others as may be required by law.

AWC-NH's status as a regulated public utility gives it the ability to petition the NHPUC for the right to exercise eminent domain for the establishment of plant and equipment.  It can also petition the NHPUC for exemption from the operation of any local ordinance when certain utility structures are reasonably necessary for the convenience or welfare of the public and the local conditions, and, if the purpose of the structure relates to water supply withdrawal, the exemption is recommended by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings

1.

Yankee Companies v. U.S. Department of Energy

The Yankee Companies have filed complaints against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims seeking monetary damages resulting from the DOE's failure to accept delivery of, and provide for a permanent facility to store, spent nuclear fuel pursuant to the terms of the 1983 spent fuel and high-level waste disposal contracts between the Yankee Companies and the DOE.  The court previously awarded the Yankee Companies damages for Phases I, II and III of litigation resulting from the DOE's failure to meet its contractual obligations.  These Phases covered damages incurred in the years 1998 through 2012, and the awarded damages have been received by the Yankee Companies with certain amounts of the damages refunded to their customers.

DOE Phase IV Damages -

On May 22, 2017, each of the Yankee Companies filed a fourth set of lawsuits against the DOE in the Court of Federal

Claims.  The Yankee Companies sought monetary damages totaling

$104.4 million

for CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC, resulting from the DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal covering the years from 2013 to 2016 (“DOE Phase IV”).  On February 21, 2019, the Yankee Companies received a partial summary judgment and partial final judgment in their favor for the undisputed amount of monetary damages of $103.2 million.  The court awarded CYAPC, YAEC, and MYAPC damages of $40.7 million, $28.1 million and $34.4 million, respectively.  The DOE did not appeal the court's judgment and the decision became final on April 23, 2019.  On June 12, 2019, each of the Yankee Companies received the damages proceeds.  On June 12, 2019, the court accepted an offer of judgment in the amount of $0.5 million to settle the disputed amount of approximately $1 million in Phase IV contested damages.  The Yankee Companies received the $0.5 million payment in July 2019.  CYAPC's and YAEC's proceeds received were classified as operating activities on the Eversource consolidated statement of cash flows.

In September 2019, the Yankee Companies made a required informational filing with FERC as to the use of proceeds, for which approval was received in the fourth quarter of 2019.  In December 2019, YAEC and MYAPC returned proceeds of $5.4 million and $21.0 million, respectively, to its member companies, of which the Eversource utilities (CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH) received a total of $2.8 million from YAEC and $5.0 million from MYAPC.  The Eversource utilities will ultimately refund these proceeds to utility customers.  Also, in December 2019, CYAPC paid $29.0 million to the DOE to partially settle its pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation.

.

The only common equity securities that are publicly traded are common shares of Eversource.  The earnings and EPS of each business discussed below do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities of such business but rather represent a direct interest in our assets and liabilities as a whole.  EPS by business is a financial measure not recognized under GAAP, calculated by dividing the Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders of each business by the weighted average diluted Eversource common shares outstanding for the period.  Our earnings discussion also includes a non-GAAP financial measure referencing our 2019 earnings and EPS excluding the impairment charge for the NPT project.

We use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate and provide details of earnings results by business and to more fully compare and explain our 2019 results without including the impact of the NPT impairment charge.  We believe the NPT impairment charge is not indicative of our ongoing performance.  Due to the nature and significance of the impairment charge on Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders, we believe that the non-GAAP presentation is a more meaningful representation of our financial performance and provides additional and useful information to readers of this report in analyzing historical and future performance of our business.  These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to reported Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders or EPS determined in accordance with GAAP as an indicator of operating performance.

The results of Aquarion and its subsidiaries, hereinafter referred to as "Aquarion," are included from the date of the acquisition, December 4, 2017, through December 31, 2019 throughout this

Strategic:

•

On February 26, 2020, Eversource and NiSource entered into an asset purchase agreement where Eversource would acquire the assets that comprise NiSource’s local gas distribution business in Massachusetts for a purchase price of $1.1 billion.  The liabilities to be assumed by Eversource specifically exclude any liabilities (past or future) arising out of or related to the fires and explosions that occurred on September 13, 2018 in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Massachusetts.  The acquisition and resulting rate plan both require DPU and other approvals.  Eversource and NiSource expect to close this transaction later this year.

Earnings Overview

Consolidated:

Below is a summary of our earnings by business, which also reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of consolidated non-GAAP earnings and EPS, as well as EPS by business, to the most directly comparable GAAP measures of consolidated Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders and diluted EPS.

Regulated Companies:

Our regulated companies comprise the electric distribution, electric transmission, natural gas distribution and water distribution segments.  A summary of our segment earnings and EPS is as follows:


Our electric distribution segment earnings

increased

$57.9 million

in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH base distribution rate increases, higher earnings from CL&P's capital tracker mechanism, effective July 1, 2018, due to increased electric system improvements, and higher earnings from NSTAR Electric's solar generation capital tracker mechanism.  The earnings increase was partially offset by higher depreciation expense, lower non-service income from our benefit plans, higher operations and maintenance expense, the absence in 2019 of generation earnings at PSNH due to the sale of its generation assets in 2018, and the absence in 2019 of a gain on the sale of property at PSNH in 2018.

Our electric transmission segment earnings

decreased

$170.7 million

in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the impairment of NPT, which resulted in an after-tax charge of

$204.4 million

, or

$0.64

per share in 2019.  Excluding the NPT impairment charge, earnings

increased

$33.7 million

in


, as compared to


, due primarily to a higher transmission rate base as a result of our continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and the absence in 2019 of approximately $6 million (after-tax) in tax-related regulatory assets that we concluded were not recoverable from customers in 2018.  The earnings increase was partially offset by a lower benefit from the annual billing and cost reconciliation filing with FERC and the absence of the NPT AFUDC equity income.

Our natural gas distribution segment earnings

increased

$3.0 million

in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the impact of the Yankee Gas base distribution rate increase effective November 15, 2018 and higher earnings from capital tracker mechanisms due to continued investments in natural gas infrastructure.  The earnings increase was partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expense, higher depreciation expense, higher property and other tax expense, and higher interest expense.

Our water distribution segment earnings

increased

$4.0 million

in


, as compared to


, due primarily to a lower effective tax rate driven by the elimination of a tax-related regulatory liability.

Eversource Parent and Other Companies:

Eversource parent and other companies earnings

decreased

$18.1 million

in


, as compared to


, due primarily to a higher effective tax rate due in part to higher income tax reserves in 2019 and the absence in 2019 of income tax benefits recognized in 2018, higher interest expense, and the absence in 2019 of a 2018 benefit related to the allowed recovery of certain previously expensed merger-related costs in distribution rates.  The earnings decrease was partially offset by the absence of the 2018 impairment of our investment in the Access Northeast project, and a higher return at Eversource Service as a result of increased investments in property, plant and equipment.

Short-Term Debt - Commercial Paper Programs and Credit Agreements

:  Eversource parent has a

$1.45 billion

commercial paper program allowing Eversource parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt.  Eversource parent, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut are also parties to a

five

-year

$1.45 billion

revolving credit facility. Effective December 9, 2019, the revolving credit facility's termination date was extended for one additional year to December 6, 2024. The revolving credit facility serves to backstop Eversource parent's

$1.45 billion

commercial paper program.

NSTAR Electric has a

$650 million

commercial paper program allowing NSTAR Electric to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt.  NSTAR Electric is also a party to a

five

-year

$650 million

revolving credit facility.  Effective December 9, 2019, the revolving credit facility's termination date was extended for one additional year to December 6, 2024.  The revolving credit facility serves to backstop NSTAR Electric's

$650 million

commercial paper program.

The amount of borrowings outstanding and available under the commercial paper programs were as follows:

There were

no

borrowings outstanding on either the Eversource parent or NSTAR Electric revolving credit facilities as of

December 31, 2019

or


.

Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper programs and revolving credit facilities are included in Notes Payable and classified in current liabilities on the Eversource and NSTAR Electric balance sheets, as all borrowings are outstanding for no more than 364 days at one time.  As a result of the Eversource parent long-term debt issuance on January 10, 2020, the net proceeds of which were used to repay short-term borrowings outstanding under its commercial paper program,

$346.3 million

of commercial paper borrowings under the Eversource parent commercial paper program were classified as Long-Term Debt as of December 31, 2019.


Intercompany Borrowings:

Eversource parent uses its available capital resources to provide loans to its subsidiaries to assist in meeting their short-term borrowing needs.  Eversource parent records intercompany interest income from its loans to subsidiaries, which is eliminated in consolidation.  Intercompany loans from Eversource parent to its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation on Eversource's balance sheets.  As of

December 31, 2019

, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to CL&P of $

63.8 million

, to PSNH of

$27.0 million

, and to a subsidiary of NSTAR Electric of

$30.3 million

. As of December 31,


, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to PSNH of $

57.0 million

.  Intercompany loans from Eversource parent are included in Notes Payable to Eversource Parent and classified in current liabilities on the respective subsidiary's balance sheets.

Long-Term Debt:

The following table summarizes long-term debt issuances and repayments:

(1)

These bonds are part of the same series issued by CL&P in March 2018.  The aggregate outstanding principal amount of these bonds is now

$800 million

.

(2)

These bonds are part of the same series issued by CL&P in March 2017.  The aggregate outstanding principal amount of these bonds is now $500 million.

Long-Term Debt Issuance Authorizations:

On February 27, 2019, the DPU approved NSTAR Electric's request for authorization to issue up to $800 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2020.  On April 26, 2019, the NHPUC approved PSNH's request for authorization to issue up to $300 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2019.  On August 14, 2019, PURA approved CL&P's request for authorization to issue up to $675 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2022.  On December 11, 2019, PURA approved Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut's request for authorization to issue up to $45 million of long-term debt.  On January 27, 2020, the DPU approved NSTAR Gas' request for authorization to issue up to $270 million in long-term debt through December 31, 2021.

Rate Reduction Bonds:

PSNH's RRB payments consist of principal and interest and are paid semi-annually, beginning on February 1, 2019.  PSNH paid $52.3 million of RRB principal payments and $26.8 million of interest payments in


.

Common Share Issuance and Forward Sale Agreement:

On June 4, 2019, Eversource completed an equity offering of

17,940,000

common shares, consisting of

5,980,000

common shares issued directly by the Company and

11,960,000

common shares issuable pursuant to a forward sale agreement with an investment bank.  The issuance of

5,980,000

common shares resulted in proceeds of

$426.9 million

, net of issuance costs.


Under the forward sale agreement, a total of

11,960,000

common shares were borrowed from third parties and sold by the underwriters.  The forward sale agreement allows Eversource, at its election and prior to May 29, 2020, to physically settle the forward sale agreement by issuing common shares in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreement (initially,

$71.48

per share) or, alternatively, to settle the forward sale agreement in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of shares or cash.  The forward sale price is subject to adjustment daily based on a floating interest rate factor and will decrease in respect of certain fixed amounts specified in the agreement, such as dividends.

On December 30, 2019, Eversource physically settled a portion of the forward sale agreement by delivering

6,000,000

common shares in exchange for net proceeds of

$425.4 million

.  The forward sale price used to determine the cash proceeds received by Eversource was calculated based on the initial forward sale price of

$71.48

per share, as adjusted in accordance with the forward sale agreement.

The 2019 issuances of

11,980,000

common shares resulted in proceeds of

$852.3 million

, net of issuance costs, and were reflected in shareholders’ equity and as financing activities on the statement of cash flows.

Eversource’s intent is to physically settle the forward sale agreement by issuing common shares.  As of

December 31, 2019

, if Eversource had elected to net settle the forward sale agreement, Eversource would have been required to pay

$84.4 million

under a cash settlement or would have been required to deliver

992,189

common shares under a net share settlement.

Issuances of shares under the forward sale agreement are classified as equity transactions.  Accordingly, no amounts relating to the forward sale agreement have or will be recorded in the financial statements until settlements take place.  Prior to any settlements, the only impact to the financial statements is the inclusion of incremental shares within the calculation of diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.  See Note 22, "Earnings Per Share," to the financial statements for information on the forward sale agreement’s impact on the calculation of diluted EPS.

Eversource used the net proceeds received upon the direct issuance of common shares and the net proceeds received upon partial settlement of the forward sale agreement to repay short-term debt under the commercial paper program, to fund capital spending and clean energy initiatives, and for general corporate purposes.

Cash Flows:

Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled

$2.01 billion

in


, compared with

$1.83 billion

in


.  The increase in operating cash flows was due primarily to a decrease in 2019 of approximately $148 million of major storm restoration cost payments, $116 million in lower payments made in 2019 to the DOE by CYAPC to partially settle its pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation, and a $73.2 million decrease in pension and PBOP cash contributions made in 2019, as compared to 2018.  Also contributing to the increase were $102.8 million of lower income tax payments made in 2019, as compared to 2018, $68.8 million in DOE Phase IV litigation proceeds received by CYAPC and YAEC in 2019, and the timing of cash collections on our accounts receivables.  Partially offsetting these favorable impacts were the timing of collections for regulatory tracking mechanisms, which were significantly impacted by the timing of collections of purchased power and transmission costs at NSTAR Electric, and the timing of accounts payable cash payments and other working capital items.

Cash flows provided by operating activities totaled $1.83 billion in 2018, compared with $2.00 billion in 2017.  The decrease in operating cash flows was due primarily to cash payments made in 2018 for storm restoration costs of approximately $252 million, an increase of $128 million in income tax payments made in 2018, as compared to 2017, and the unfavorable impacts related to the timing of payments of our working capital items, including accounts receivable and accounts payable. In addition, in December 2018, CYAPC paid $145 million to the DOE to partially settle its pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation.  Partially offsetting these unfavorable impacts were the timing of cash collected for regulatory tracking mechanisms

and a decrease of $47.9 million in 2018 of pension and PBOP contributions.

In


, we paid cash dividends of

$663.2 million

and issued non-cash dividends of

$22.8 million

in the form of treasury shares, totaling dividends of

$2.14

per common share, compared with cash dividends of

$640.1 million

, or

$2.02

Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each uses its available capital resources to fund its respective construction expenditures, meet debt requirements, pay operating costs, including storm-related costs, pay dividends, and fund other corporate obligations, such as pension contributions.  Eversource's regulated companies recover their electric, natural gas and water distribution construction expenditures as the related project costs are depreciated over the life of the assets.  This impacts the timing of the revenue stream designed to fully recover the total investment plus a return on the equity and debt used to finance the investments.  The current growth in Eversource's construction expenditures utilizes a significant amount of cash for projects that have a long-term return on investment and recovery period, totaling approximately

$31.3 million

related to fair value adjustments from our various business combinations that will be amortized within the next 12 months and have no cash flow impact.  Eversource, with its strong credit ratings, has several options available in the financial markets to repay or refinance these maturities with the issuance of new long-term debt.  Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH will reduce their short-term borrowings with operating cash flows or with the issuance of new long-term debt, determined by considering capital requirements and maintenance of Eversource's credit rating and profile.

We expect the future operating cash flows of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, along with our existing borrowing availability and access to both debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to meet any working capital and future operating requirements, and capital investment forecasted opportunities.

Eastern Massachusetts Transmission Projects:

These projects consist of a portfolio of electric transmission upgrades in southern New Hampshire, northern Massachusetts and continuing into the greater Boston metropolitan area, of which 28 upgrades are in Eversource's service territory (two in New Hampshire and 26 in Massachusetts).  The two New Hampshire upgrades, including the Merrimack Valley Reliability Project, have been placed in service, and 20 Massachusetts upgrades have been placed in service.  On December 17, 2019, the Massachusetts Siting Board issued a favorable decision on the Sudbury-Hudson Reliability Project, the last project requiring such approval.  On January 17, 2020, the Town of Sudbury and Protect Sudbury, a community group, appealed the decision to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.  The majority of the remaining upgrades are under construction and are expected to be placed in service in 2021.  We estimate our portion of the investment will be approximately $750 million, of which $442.2 million has been spent and capitalized through

December 31, 2019

.


Hartford-Area Transmission Projects:

These projects consist of 27 projects in the Hartford, Connecticut area with an expected investment of approximately $350 million.  As of

December 31, 2019

, 24 projects have been placed in service, and three projects are in active construction and are expected to be placed in service through mid-2020.  As of

December 31, 2019

, CL&P had spent and capitalized $275.9 million in costs associated with these projects.

Seacoast Reliability Project

:  The Seacoast Reliability Project consists of a 13-mile, 115kV transmission line within several New Hampshire communities, using a combination of overhead, underground and underwater line designs to help meet the growing demand for electricity in the Seacoast region.  On December 10, 2018, the NHSEC indicated its unanimous approval of the project, and subsequently issued its written decision on January 31, 2019.  On May 13, 2019, two appeals of the NHSEC's approval orders were filed with the New Hampshire Supreme Court.  On December 17, 2019, the Conservation Law Foundation requested the Court to withdraw its appeal, and the Court granted the request on December 20, 2019.  The other appeal remains pending.  This project is under construction and is scheduled to be completed in the second quarter of 2020.  We estimate the investment will be approximately $125 million, of which PSNH had spent and capitalized $89.0 million in costs through

December 31, 2019

.

All project costs are anticipated to be fully recoverable through transmission rates.

Distribution Business:

A summary of distribution capital expenditures is as follows:

(1)

Our water distribution business was acquired on December 4, 2017.  Amounts are immaterial for the year ended December 31, 2017.

For the electric distribution business, basic business includes the purchase of meters, tools, vehicles, information technology, transformer replacements, equipment facilities, and the relocation of plant.  Aging infrastructure relates to reliability and the replacement of overhead lines, plant substations, underground cable replacement, and equipment failures.  Load growth and other includes requests for new business and capacity additions on distribution lines and substation additions and expansions.

For the natural gas distribution business, basic business addresses daily operational needs including meters, pipe relocations due to public works projects, vehicles, and tools.  Aging infrastructure projects seek to improve the reliability of the system through enhancements related to cast iron and bare steel replacement of main and services, corrosion mediation, and station upgrades.  Load growth and other reflects growth in existing service territories including new developments, installation of services, and expansion.

For the water distribution business, basic business addresses daily operational needs including periodic meter replacement, water main relocation, facility maintenance, and tools.  Aging infrastructure relates to reliability and the replacement of water mains, regulators, storage tanks, pumping stations, wellfields, reservoirs, and treatment facilities.  Load growth and other reflects growth in our service territory, including improvements to acquisitions, installation of new services, and interconnections of systems.


Acquisition of Assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts

:  On February 26, 2020, Eversource and NiSource entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Agreement) pursuant to which Eversource would acquire the assets that comprise NiSource’s local gas distribution business, currently doing business as Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (CMA). The purchase price of $1.1 billion includes a target working capital amount that would be adjusted to reflect actual working capital as of the closing date. Eversource would acquire approximately 330,000 residential, commercial, and industrial natural gas customers, as well as over 5,000 miles of natural gas distribution pipeline across more than 60 communities in Massachusetts.

The liabilities to be assumed by Eversource under the Agreement specifically exclude any liabilities (past and future) arising out of or related to the fires and explosions that occurred on September 13, 2018 in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Massachusetts related to the delivery of natural gas by CMA, including certain subsequent events, all as described in the DPU's Order on Scope dated December 23, 2019 (D.P.U. 19-141) (the Greater Lawrence Incident or GLI), and any further emergency events prior to the closing of the acquisition related to the restoration and reconstruction with respect to the GLI, including any losses arising out of or related to any litigation, demand, cause of action, claim, suit, investigation, proceeding, indemnification agreements or rights.

The acquisition and resulting rate plan both require DPU and other approvals. Eversource and NiSource expect to close this transaction later this year.

Projected Capital Expenditures:

A summary of the projected capital expenditures for the regulated companies' electric transmission and for the total electric distribution, natural gas distribution and water distribution for


through


, including information technology and facilities upgrades and enhancements on behalf of the regulated companies, is as follows:

The projections do not include investments related to offshore wind projects.  Actual capital expenditures could vary from the projected amounts for the companies and years above.

Offshore Wind Business:

Our offshore wind business includes ownership interests in North East Offshore and Bay State Wind, which together hold PPAs and contracts for the Revolution Wind, South Fork Wind and Sunrise Wind projects, as well as offshore leases through BOEM.  Our offshore wind projects are being developed and constructed through a joint and equal partnership with Ørsted.  This partnership also participates in opportunities for solicitations for offshore wind energy in the Northeast U.S.

On February 8, 2019, Eversource and Ørsted entered into an equal partnership to acquire key offshore wind assets in the Northeast.  Eversource has a 50 percent ownership interest in North East Offshore, which holds the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects, as well as a 257 square-mile lease off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  Eversource also has a 50 percent ownership interest in Bay State Wind, which holds the Sunrise Wind project.  Bay State Wind's separate 300-square-mile ocean lease is located approximately 25 miles south of the coast of Massachusetts adjacent to the North East Offshore area.  In aggregate, the Bay State Wind and the North East Offshore lease sites jointly-owned by Eversource and Ørsted could eventually develop at least 4,000 MW of clean, renewable offshore wind energy.  As of

December 31, 2019

, Eversource's total equity investment balance in its offshore wind business was

$649.3 million

.

Currently we are developing our construction and operations plans, concluding on final offshore and onshore project designs and working through our siting and permitting processes, all of which is competitively sensitive. Subject to finalization of these plans, designs and processes, all of which are subject to change and modification as a result of our investment decisions, permit approval timelines and final design decisions, we currently expect to make additional investments in our offshore wind business of approximately $300 million to $400 million over the course of 2020.

The following table provides a summary of the Eversource and Ørsted major projects with announced contracts:


(1)

The pricing for the Revolution Wind contracts in Connecticut has not yet been publicly disclosed.

(2)

Index OREC strike price.

(3)

The Long Island Power Authority (LIPA) agreed to expand the original 20-year PPA from 90 MW to 130 MW through an amendment to the original agreement. Negotiations are currently underway, and a final amendment is expected in the first half of 2020.

On October 23, 2019, the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) announced the execution of a 25-year agreement with the Sunrise Wind project to purchase Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificates (ORECs) from an 880 MW offshore wind facility. The Sunrise Wind project is held by Bay State Wind and will use a combination of lease areas from Bay State Wind and North East Offshore. Sunrise Wind will be developed 35 miles east of Montauk Point, Long Island.

The completion dates for these projects are subject to federal permitting through BOEM, engineering, state siting and permitting in New York and Rhode Island, and finalizing a PPA amendment in New York.  Significant delays in the siting and permitting process, including the timing of obtaining BOEM approval, could adversely impact the timing of these projects' in-service dates.  Currently, BOEM has indicated it will complete its Cumulative Impact Study as part of the Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for a non-affiliated offshore wind project during the second quarter of 2020.  The study is designed to assess the overall environmental impact of all offshore wind projects.  Federal siting and permitting have commenced for the South Fork Wind project, as it has filed its Construction Operations Plan (COP) application with BOEM.  South Fork Wind is designated as "FAST-41" by the U.S. Federal Permitting Improvement Council’s FAST-41 infrastructure projects, which provides greater federal assistance associated with program timelines.  Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind COP filings are planned in 2020.  South Fork Wind previously filed federal and state applications in 2018.  State agencies also will review siting applications for Revolution Wind and Sunrise Wind in New York and Rhode Island, with application filings planned in 2020.

FERC Regulatory Matters

FERC ROE Complaints

:  Four separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively, the Complainants).  In each of the first three complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of

11.14 percent

that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate


-month complaint periods.  In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of

10.57 percent

and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of

11.74 percent

, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable.

The ROE originally billed during the period October 1, 2011 (beginning of the first complaint period) through October 15, 2014 consisted of a base ROE of

11.14 percent

and incentives up to

13.1 percent

.  On October 16, 2014, the FERC set the base ROE at 10.57 percent and the incentive cap at

11.74 percent

for the first complaint period.  This was also effective for all prospective billings to customers beginning October 16, 2014.  This FERC order was vacated on April 14, 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court).

All amounts associated with the first complaint period have been refunded.  Eversource has recorded a reserve of

$39.1 million

(pre-tax and excluding interest) for the second complaint period as of

December 31, 2019

.  This reserve represents the difference between the billed rates during the second complaint period and a

10.57 percent

base ROE and

11.74 percent

incentive cap.  The reserve consisted of

$21.4 million

for CL&P,

$14.6 million

for NSTAR Electric and

$3.1 million

for PSNH as of

December 31, 2019

.

On October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court.  FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE.  Initial briefs were filed by the NETOs, Complainants and FERC Trial Staff on January 11, 2019 and reply briefs were filed on March 8, 2019.  The NETOs' brief was supportive of the overall ROE methodology determined in the October 16, 2018 order provided the FERC does not change the proposed methodology or alter its implementation in a manner that has a material impact on the results.

The FERC order included illustrative calculations for the first complaint using FERC's proposed frameworks with financial data from that complaint.  Those illustrative calculations indicated that for the first complaint period, for the NETOs, which FERC concludes are of average financial risk, the preliminary just and reasonable base ROE is

10.41 percent

and the preliminary incentive cap on total ROE is

13.08 percent

.

If the results of the illustrative calculations were included in a final FERC order for each of the complaint periods, then a

10.41 percent

base ROE and a

13.08 percent

incentive cap would not have a significant impact on our financial statements for all of the complaint periods.  These preliminary calculations are not binding and do not represent what we believe to be the most likely outcome of a final FERC order.


On November 21, 2019, FERC issued an order concerning the transmission ROEs for the Midcontinent ISO transmission owners (MISO).  In that order, FERC adopted another new methodology for determining base ROEs for MISO, which differed significantly from the methodology and framework set forth in its October 16, 2018 FERC order on the NETOs’ ROE dockets.  On December 23, 2019, the NETOs filed a Supplemental Paper Hearing Brief and a Motion to supplement the record in the NETO ROE dockets to respond to the new methodology proposed in the MISO order, as there is uncertainty to whether it may be applied to the NETOs’ cases.  On January 21, 2020, the FERC issued an order granting rehearing for further consideration to give the FERC more time to act on the substantive issues of the MISO ROE proceedings.  Further changes to the methodology by FERC are possible as a result of the arguments in both the MISO and NETO proceedings.  Given the significant uncertainty relating to the October 2018 FERC order, the November 2019 FERC order to MISO, and the FERC's rehearing of the MISO order, the Company is unable to predict the potential effect of the MISO order on the NETO complaints or the outcome of the four complaints and concluded that there is no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaint periods at this time.  Further, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of gain or loss for any of the four complaint proceedings.

Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH currently record revenues at the

10.57 percent

base ROE and incentive cap at

11.74 percent

established in the October 16, 2014 FERC order.

A change of


basis points to the base ROE used to establish the reserves would impact Eversource’s after-tax earnings by an average of approximately

$3 million

for each of the four 15-month complaint periods.

FERC Notices of Inquiry:

On March 21, 2019, FERC issued two Notices of Inquiry (NOI) that may affect Eversource transmission ROEs and incentives.  One NOI (the "FERC ROE NOI") seeks comments from all stakeholders on FERC's policies for evaluating ROEs for electric public utilities, and interstate natural gas and oil pipelines.  The other NOI (the FERC transmission incentives NOI) seeks comments on FERC's policies for implementing electric transmission incentives.  On June 26, 2019, the NETOs jointly filed comments in the FERC ROE NOI, supporting the methodology established in the FERC’s October 16, 2018 order with minor enhancements going forward.  Also, on June 26, 2019, Eversource filed comments in the FERC transmission incentives NOI, requesting that FERC retain policies that have been effective in encouraging new transmission investment and remain flexible enough to attract investment in new and emerging transmission technologies.  The NETOs jointly filed reply comments in the FERC ROE NOI on July 26, 2019.  Eversource filed reply comments in the FERC transmission incentives NOI on August 26, 2019.  At this time, Eversource cannot predict how these NOIs will affect its ROEs or incentives.

FERC Transmission Rate Settlement:

On December 28, 2015, FERC initiated a proceeding to review the NETOs' regional and local transmission formula rates due to a lack of transparency, finding that the formula rates appeared to lack sufficient details to determine how costs are derived and recovered in rates.  This proceeding was set for hearing but held in abeyance to provide time for settlement judge procedures.  On August 17, 2018, a signed Settlement Agreement between twenty-eight parties, including all six New England state regulatory commissions, the NETOs (including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH) and other settling parties, was filed at the FERC.  The Settlement Agreement included, among other things, a new formula rate template in which all regional and local transmission revenue requirements will be determined through a single formula rate.  The Settlement Agreement was contested by a group of municipal entities and the FERC Trial Staff.  On May 22, 2019, FERC rejected the Settlement Agreement and remanded the proceeding for hearings.  The parties have been engaged in further settlement negotiations and reached an agreement in principle on October 22, 2019.  The FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge has approved two suspensions of the schedule for ninety days each for the NETOs to review the terms with other active parties and finalize the settlement.  The procedural schedule has been suspended to April 22, 2020.

U.S. Federal Corporate Income Taxes:

Effective January 1, 2018, the local transmission service rates were updated to reflect the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate that resulted from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.  On June 28, 2018, FERC granted a one-time waiver of tariff provisions related to the federal corporate income tax rate so that, effective June 1, 2018, the regional transmission service rates also reflect the reduced federal corporate income tax rate of 21 percent. The local and regional transmission service rates do not currently reflect amortization of excess ADIT (EDIT) balances that resulted from the Act. On November 15, 2018, FERC issued a Policy Statement and a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking addressing accounting and rate issues related to ADIT changes resulting from the Act.  On November 21, 2019, FERC issued its final rule requiring public utilities with transmission formula rates to make adjustments to ADIT and EDIT.  Eversource expects to submit a filing demonstrating its compliance with the final rule in the second half of 2020.

Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters

Electric, Natural Gas and Water Utility Base Distribution Rates:

Each Eversource utility subsidiary is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the state in which it operates:  CL&P, Yankee Gas and Aquarion operate in Connecticut and are subject to PURA regulation; NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and Aquarion operate in Massachusetts and are subject to DPU regulation; and PSNH and Aquarion operate in New Hampshire and are subject to NHPUC regulation.  The regulated companies' distribution rates are set by their respective state regulatory commissions, and their tariffs include mechanisms for periodically adjusting their rates for the recovery of specific incurred costs.

In Connecticut, electric and natural gas utilities are required to file a distribution rate case, or for PURA to initiate a rate review, within four years of the last rate case.  CL&P's distribution rates were established in an April 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective May 1, 2018.  Yankee Gas' distribution rates were established in a December 2018 PURA-approved rate case settlement agreement with rates effective November 15, 2018.  Aquarion is not required to initiate a rate review with the PURA.  Aquarion rates were established in a 2013 PURA-approved rate case.

In Massachusetts, electric distribution companies are required to file at least one distribution rate case every five years, and natural gas local distribution companies to file at least one distribution rate case every 10 years, and those companies are limited to one settlement agreement in any 10-year period.  NSTAR Electric's distribution rates were established in a 2017 DPU-approved rate case with rates effective February 1, 2018.


NSTAR Gas' distribution rates were established in a 2015 DPU-approved rate case.  See "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - Massachusetts" in this

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,

for NSTAR Gas' November 2019 rate case application with the DPU.  Aquarion is not required to initiate a rate review with the DPU.  Aquarion rates were established in an October 2018 DPU-approved rate case.

In New Hampshire, PSNH's temporary distribution rates were established in a settlement agreement approved by the NHPUC on June 27, 2019, with temporary rates effective July 1, 2019.  On May 28, 2019, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for a permanent increase in base distribution rates, effective July 1, 2020.  See "Regulatory Developments and Rate Matters - New Hampshire" in this

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,

for more information.  Aquarion rates were established in a 2013 NHPUC-approved rate case, further revised in 2016.  In a 2019 settlement approved by the NHPUC, Aquarion was ordered to file its next full rate proceeding no later than 2020.

Electric, Natural Gas and Water Utility Retail Rates:

The Eversource electric distribution companies obtain and resell power to retail customers who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier.  The natural gas distribution companies procure natural gas for firm and seasonal customers.  These energy supply procurement costs are recovered from customers in energy supply rates that are approved by the respective state regulatory commission.  The rates are reset periodically and are fully reconciled to their costs.  Each electric and natural gas distribution company fully recovers its energy supply costs through approved regulatory rate mechanisms on a timely basis and, therefore, such costs have no impact on earnings.

The electric and natural gas distribution companies also recover certain other costs on a fully reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and, therefore, recovery of these costs have no impact on earnings.  Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, energy efficiency program costs, electric retail transmission charges, electric restructuring and stranded costs (including securitized RRB charges), and additionally for our Massachusetts companies, pension and PBOP benefits and net metering for distributed generation.  The reconciliation filings compare the total actual costs allowed to revenue requirements related to these services and the difference between the costs incurred (or the rate recovery allowed) and the actual costs allowed is deferred and included, to be either recovered or refunded, in future customer rates.  These cost tracking mechanisms also include certain incentives earned, return on rate base, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings.

U.S. Federal Corporate Income Taxes:

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law, which amended existing federal tax rules to reduce the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018.  For our regulated companies, the most significant changes are (1) the benefit of incurring a lower federal income tax expense and (2) the reduction in ADIT liabilities (now excess ADIT or EDIT), which are estimated to be approximately

$2.8 billion

and are included in regulatory liabilities as of

December 31, 2019

.  The refund of these EDIT regulatory liabilities to customers will generally be made over the same period as the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets that gave rise to the ADIT liabilities. The refund of EDIT has begun at most of our distribution companies and is reflected in rates.  The refund to customers and resulting amortization of the EDIT regulatory liabilities results in lower Revenues on the statements of income and lower current tax expense. This is offset by the reduction to Income Tax Expense due to the amortization of the EDIT.  The refund of EDIT results in a lower effective tax rate and no impact on net income.

Eversource established a regulatory liability, recorded as a reduction to revenue, to reflect the difference between the 35 percent federal corporate income tax rate included in rates charged to customers and the 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, until rates billed to customers reflected the lower federal tax rate.  As of

December 31, 2019

, this liability, net of amounts refunded to customers, was

$14.6 million

.


Eversource's regulated companies are in the process of, or will, refund the decrease in the income tax rate based on orders issued by applicable state and federal regulatory commissions.  A summary of the timing of refunds related to the change in the tax rate is as follows:

Connecticut:

CL&P Storm Filing:

CL&P's approved rate case settlement in 2018 incorporated $18.6 million of rate base recovery for catastrophic storms occurring after December 31, 2016, subject to a future storm filing.  On November 16, 2018, CL&P filed for recovery of

$153 million

of storm costs incurred from October 2017 through May 2018, with recovery over six years to begin May 1, 2019.  Through the course of the proceeding, CL&P updated its request to

$145.5 million

to reflect final invoicing and capitalization amounts.  On April 17, 2019, PURA authorized recovery of

$141.0 million

as part of storm cost recovery and the remainder to be recorded to plant or other balance sheet accounts.

Massachusetts:

NSTAR Electric Distribution Rates

:  As part of an inflation-based mechanism, NSTAR Electric submitted its second annual Performance Based Rate Adjustment filing on September 16, 2019 and the DPU approved a $33.6 million increase to base distribution rates on December 19, 2019 for effect on January 1, 2020.

NSTAR Gas Rate Case

:  On November 8, 2019, NSTAR Gas filed its application with the DPU, which sought a distribution rate increase of $38.0 million effective October 1, 2020.  As part of this filing, NSTAR Gas also proposed to continue its ongoing Gas System Enhancement Program (GSEP), include the GSEP investments since 2015 into base rates, and implement a performance-based ratemaking plan.  A final decision from the DPU is expected by September 30, 2020.

Hingham Vote to Acquire Water System:

On April 22, 2019, the town of Hingham, Massachusetts voted to acquire the water system and treatment plant that supplies water to the towns of Hingham, Hull and North Cohasset.  The acquisition price is currently estimated to be more than $100 million, subject to adjustment based on actual capital investments as legally required and other future closing adjustments.  Aquarion will continue to operate the water system consistent in all material respects with its obligations under applicable law during the transition period, until the sale closes.  The Company is evaluating the impact of the sale on its financial statements, which will be recorded when the sale transaction closes.  No loss is expected upon the ultimate conclusion of this transaction.  The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2020.  As of December 31, 2019, these water distribution assets were included within Property, Plant and Equipment, Net and goodwill on the balance sheet and were also reflected in the Water Distribution segment and reporting unit.

New Hampshire:

Distribution Rates:

On April 26, 2019, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for approval of a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of approximately $33 million, effective July 1, 2019.  On June 27, 2019, the NHPUC approved a settlement agreement that was reached by PSNH, the NHPUC Staff, the Office of the Consumer Advocate, and another settling party, to implement a temporary annual base distribution rate increase of $28.3 million.  Although new rates were implemented on August 1, 2019 to customers, the provisions of the temporary base distribution rate increase were effective July 1, 2019.  The settlement agreement also permits PSNH to recover approximately $68.5 million in unrecovered storm costs over a five-year period beginning August 1, 2019, with debt carrying charges, which is included in the temporary rate increase.

On May 28, 2019, PSNH filed an application with the NHPUC for a permanent increase in base distribution rates of approximately $70 million, effective July 1, 2020, which includes the temporary rate increase request.  The temporary rates are subject to reconciliation based on the outcome of the permanent rate case now before the NHPUC.  The NHPUC is permitted up to twelve months to adjudicate the permanent rate application from the date of filing.  A decision by the NHPUC is expected in the second quarter of 2020.


2013 through 2016 Storm Costs:

On March 26, 2019, the NHPUC approved the recovery of $38.1 million, plus carrying charges, of storm costs incurred from December 2013 through April 2016 and the transfer of funding from PSNH’s major storm reserve to recover those costs.  The costs of these storms (excluding the equity return component of the carrying charges) were deferred as regulatory assets, and the funding reserve collected from customers was accrued as a regulatory liability.  As a result of the duration of time between incurring storm costs in December 2013 through April 2016 and final approval from the NHPUC in 2019, PSNH recognized $5.2 million (pre-tax) for the equity return component of the carrying charges within Other Income, Net on the statement of income in 2019, which has been collected from customers.  Also included in the March 26, 2019 NHPUC approval is a prospective requirement for PSNH to annually net its storm funding reserve collected from customers against deferred storm costs.

Legislative and Policy Matters

New Hampshire:

On July 8, 2019, the New Hampshire Superior Court approved a settlement between PSNH and the Town of Bow, New Hampshire, where the town had over-assessed the value of the property owned by PSNH for the 2014 through 2018 property tax years.  The result of this settlement was $10.0 million in over-paid property taxes, of which PSNH has received $4.25 million in cash through December 31, 2019. PSNH will receive the balance thereafter to be credited against future property taxes payable, annually through 2023.

In addition, PSNH reached a collective resolution with an additional 61 municipalities for an aggregate total of approximately $7 million, where the towns had over-assessed the value of the property owned by PSNH for the 2015 through 2017 property tax years.

Federal:

On December 20, 2019, the "Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020," became law, which provided a one-year extension of the production tax credit or the investment tax credit for renewable wind projects under Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on which construction begins before January 1, 2021.  If construction begins on a qualifying wind project in 2020, the project will qualify for a production tax credit of $15 per MWh or an 18 percent investment tax credit.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates, assumptions and, at times, difficult, subjective or complex judgments.  Changes in these estimates, assumptions and judgments, in and of themselves, could materially impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Our management discusses with the Audit Committee of our Board of Trustees significant matters relating to critical accounting policies.  Our critical accounting policies are discussed below.  See the combined notes to our financial statements for further information concerning the accounting policies, estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements.

Regulatory Accounting

:  Our regulated companies are subject to rate regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses.  The regulated companies' financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process.  The rates charged to the customers of our regulated companies are designed to collect each company's costs to provide service, plus a return on investment.

The application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities.  Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates.  In some cases, we record regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission.  We must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery.  We base our conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent.  Regulatory liabilities represent either revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.

We use judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on our financial statements.  We believe it is probable that each of the regulated companies will recover the regulatory assets that have been recorded.  If we determine that we can no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to our operations, or that we cannot conclude it is probable that costs will be recovered from customers in future rates, the costs would be charged to net income in the period in which the determination is made.

Pension, SERP and PBOP:

We sponsor Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans to provide retirement benefits to our employees.  For each of these plans, several significant assumptions are used to determine the projected benefit obligation, funded status and net periodic benefit cost.  These assumptions include the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rate, compensation/progression rate and mortality and retirement assumptions.  We evaluate these assumptions at least annually and adjust them as necessary.  Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

:  In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we consider historical and expected returns, as well as input from our consultants.  Our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding expected rates of return for each asset class.  We routinely review the actual asset allocations and periodically rebalance the investments to the targeted asset allocations when appropriate.  For the year ended December 31,


, our expected long-term rate-of-return assumption used to determine our pension and PBOP expense was

8.25 percent

for the Eversource Service plans and

7 percent

for the Aquarion plans.  For the forecasted


pension and PBOP expense, an expected long-term rate of return of

8.25 percent

for the Eversource Service plans and

7 percent

for the Aquarion plans will be used reflecting our target asset allocations.

Discount Rate

:  Payment obligations related to the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are discounted at interest rates applicable to the expected timing of each plan's cash flows.  The discount rate that was utilized in determining the pension, SERP and PBOP obligations was based on a yield-curve approach.  This approach utilizes a population of bonds with an average rating of AA based on bond ratings by Moody's, S&P and Fitch, and uses bonds with above median yields within that population.  As of December 31,


, the discount rates used to determine the funded status were within a range of

3.04 percent

to

3.35 percent

for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of

3.26 percent

to

3.28 percent

for the PBOP Plans.  As of December 31,


, the discount rates used were within a range of

4.22 percent

to

4.45 percent

for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of

4.38 percent

to

4.41 percent

for the PBOP Plans.  The decrease in the discount rates used to calculate the funded status resulted in an increase to the Pension and PBOP Plans' liability of

$813.1 million

and

$88.6 million

, respectively, as of December 31,


.

The Company uses the spot rate methodology for the service and interest cost components of Pension, SERP and PBOP expense because it provides a more precise measurement by matching projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.  The discount rates used to estimate the


expense were within a range of

2.63 percent

to

3.55 percent

for the Pension and SERP Plans, and within a range of

3.85 percent

to

4.65 percent

for the PBOP Plans.

Mortality Assumptions:

Assumptions as to mortality of the participants in our Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are a key estimate in measuring the expected payments a participant may receive over their lifetime and the corresponding plan liability we need to record.  In 2019, a revised scale for the mortality table was released, and we utilized it in our measurements.

Compensation/Progression Rate

:  This assumption reflects the expected long-term salary growth rate, including consideration of the levels of increases built into collective bargaining agreements, and impacts the estimated benefits that Pension and SERP Plan participants receive in the future.  As of December 31,


and


, the compensation/progression rate used to determine the funded status was

3.50 percent

for the Eversource Service plans and

4 percent

for the Aquarion plans.

Health Care Cost

:  The Eversource Service PBOP Plan is not subject to health care cost trends.  As of December 31,


, for the Aquarion PBOP Plan, the health care cost trend rate is a range of

3.5 percent

to

6.5 percent

, with an ultimate rate of

3.5 percent

to

5 percent

in 2019 and 2023, for post-65 and pre-65 retirees, respectively.

Actuarial Determination of Expense

:  Pension, SERP and PBOP expense is determined by our actuaries and consists of service cost and prior service cost, interest cost based on the discounting of the obligations, and amortization of actuarial gains and losses, offset by the expected return on plan assets.  Actuarial gains and losses represent the amortization of differences between assumptions and actual information or updated assumptions.  Pre-tax net periodic benefit expense for the Pension and SERP Plans was

$63.7 million

,

$39.6 million

and

$64.9 million

for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively.  For the PBOP Plans, there was net periodic PBOP income of

$41.5 million

,

$45.0 million

and

$39.6 million

for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively.

The expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the assumed long-term rate of return to the Pension and PBOP Plan asset balances.  This calculated expected return is compared to the actual return or loss on plan assets at the end of each year to determine the investment gains or losses to be immediately reflected in unamortized actuarial gains and losses.

Forecasted Expenses and Expected Contributions

:  We estimate that expense in


for the Pension and SERP Plans will be approximately

$53 million

and income in


for the PBOP Plans will be approximately

$52 million

.  Pension, SERP and PBOP expense for subsequent years will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and other assumptions, and various other factors related to the populations participating in the plans.

Our policy is to fund the Pension Plans annually in an amount at least equal to the amount that will satisfy all federal funding requirements.  We contributed

$112.5 million

to the Pension Plans in


.  We currently estimate contributing

$105.0 million

to the Pension Plans in 2020.

It is our policy to fund the PBOP Plans annually through tax deductible contributions to external trusts.  We contributed

$9.3 million

to the PBOP Plans in


.  We currently estimate contributing

$2.9 million

to the PBOP Plans in 2020.

Sensitivity Analysis

:  The following represents the hypothetical increase to the Pension Plans' (excluding the SERP Plans) reported annual cost and a decrease to the PBOP Plans' reported annual income as a result of a change in the following assumptions by 50 basis points:

Goodwill:

We recorded goodwill on our balance sheet associated with previous mergers and acquisitions, which totaled

$4.4 billion

as of December 31,


.  We have identified our reporting units for purposes of allocating and testing goodwill as Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution.  Electric Distribution and Electric Transmission reporting units include carrying values for the respective components of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  The Natural Gas Distribution reporting unit includes the carrying values of NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas. The Water Distribution reporting unit includes the Aquarion water utility businesses.  As of December 31,


, goodwill was allocated to the reporting units as follows:

$2.5 billion

to Electric Distribution,

$0.6 billion

to Electric Transmission,

$0.4 billion

to Natural Gas Distribution and

$0.9 billion

to Water Distribution.

We are required to test goodwill balances for impairment at least annually by considering the fair values of the reporting units, which requires us to use estimates and judgments.  We have selected October 1st of each year as the annual goodwill impairment testing date.  Goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value and if the implied fair value of goodwill based on the estimated fair values of the reporting units' assets and liabilities is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill.  If goodwill were deemed to be impaired, it would be written down in the current period to the extent of the impairment.

We performed an impairment test of goodwill as of October 1,


for the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reporting units.  This evaluation required the consideration of several factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units, including conditions and assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units.  Key considerations include discount rates, utility sector market performance and merger transaction multiples, and internal estimates of future cash flows and net income.

The


goodwill impairment test resulted in a conclusion that goodwill is not impaired and no reporting unit is at risk of a goodwill impairment. The fair value of the reporting units was substantially in excess of carrying value.

Long-Lived Assets:

Impairment evaluations of long-lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and other assets, involve a significant degree of estimation and judgment, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist. Impairment analysis is required when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long-lived asset may not be recoverable.  Indicators of potential impairment include a deteriorating business climate, unfavorable regulatory action, decline in value that is other than temporary in nature, plans to dispose of a long-lived asset significantly before the end of its useful life, and accumulation of costs that are in excess of amounts allowed for recovery.  The review of long-lived assets for impairment utilizes significant assumptions about operating strategies and external developments, including assessment of current and projected market conditions that can impact future cash flows.


Impairment of Northern Pass Transmission:  Northern Pass was Eversource's planned

1,090

MW HVDC transmission line that would have interconnected from the Québec-New Hampshire border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire.  As a result of a final decision received on July 19, 2019 from the New Hampshire Supreme Court, whereby the court denied Northern Pass’ appeal and affirmed the NHSEC’s denial of Northern Pass’ siting application on NPT, Eversource concluded that construction of NPT was no longer probable and that there was no constructive path forward for the project.  Eversource terminated the project and permanently abandoned any further development.  As a result, substantially all of the capitalized project costs, which totaled

$318 million

, certain of which are subject to cost reimbursement agreements, were impaired.

Based on the conclusion that the construction of Northern Pass was no longer probable, Eversource recorded an impairment charge in 2019 for all of the project costs associated with Northern Pass, which were primarily engineering design, siting, permitting and legal costs, along with appropriate allowances for funds used during construction, and recognized a receivable for certain cost reimbursement agreements.  Additionally, Eversource recorded an impairment charge associated with the land acquired to construct Northern Pass in order to recognize the land at its estimated fair value based on assessed values and transaction costs.  In total, this resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of

$239.6 million

within Operating Income on the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2019, and was reflected in the Electric Transmission segment.  The after-tax impact of the impairment charge was

$204.4 million

, or

$0.64 per share

, after giving effect to the estimated fair value of the related land, reimbursement agreements, and the impact of expected income tax benefits associated with the impairment charge.  As a result of the decision to terminate the NPT project and permanently abandon any further development, Eversource does not expect any future cash expenditures associated with this project.

Equity Method Investments:

Investments in affiliates where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee are initially recognized as an equity method investment at cost.  Any differences between the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of an investee are considered basis differences, and are determined based upon the estimated fair values of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities.  For our offshore wind equity method investment, basis differences are related to intangible assets for PPAs that will be amortized over the term of the PPAs, and equity method goodwill that are not amortized.  Capitalized interest associated with our offshore wind equity method investment is included in the investment balance.

Equity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value.  If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.  Impairment evaluations involve a significant degree of judgment and estimation, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist and developing an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows.

Eversource recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of

$32.9 million

within Other Income, Net on our statement of income in 2018, related to Access Northeast, an equity method investment. In September 2018, a series of non-Eversource natural gas explosions in eastern Massachusetts resulted in widespread property and system damage, personal injuries, and a fatality.  Eversource identified the September 2018 natural gas series of explosions, compounded by the adverse legislative environment, as negative evidence that indicated potential impairment of our investment in Access Northeast.  Our impairment assessment used a discounted cash flow approach, including consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in fair value of our investment in the project, and involved significant management judgment and estimation, including projections of the project’s discounted cash flows and assumptions about exit price.  In the third quarter of 2018, management determined that the future cash flows of the Access Northeast project were uncertain and could no longer be reasonably estimated and that the book value of our equity method investment was not recoverable. On April 1, 2019, pursuant to a provision in the partnership agreement jointly entered into by Eversource, Enbridge, Inc. and National Grid plc, through Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC, the Access Northeast project was terminated.

Income Taxes:

Income tax expense is estimated for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and is recorded each quarter using an estimated annualized effective tax rate.  This process to record income tax expense involves estimating current and deferred income tax expense or benefit and the impact of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for financial reporting and income tax return reporting purposes.  Such differences are the result of timing of the deduction for expenses, as well as any impact of permanent differences, non-tax deductible expenses, or other items that directly impact income tax expense as a result of regulatory activity (flow-through items).  The temporary differences and flow-through items result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in the balance sheets.

We also account for uncertainty in income taxes, which applies to all income tax positions previously filed in a tax return and income tax positions expected to be taken in a future tax return that have been reflected on our balance sheets.  The determination of whether a tax position meets the recognition threshold under applicable accounting guidance is based on facts and circumstances available to us.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law, which amended existing federal tax rules and included numerous provisions that impacted corporations.  In particular, the act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018.  For our regulated companies, the most significant changes are (1) the benefit of incurring a lower federal income tax expense and (2) the reduction in ADIT liabilities (now excess ADIT or EDIT), which are estimated to be approximately

$2.8 billion

and are included in regulatory liabilities as of

December 31, 2019

.  Eversource's regulated companies are in the process of, or will be, refunding the EDIT liabilities to customers based on orders issued by applicable state regulatory commissions.  The refund of these regulatory liabilities to customers will generally be made over the same period as the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets that gave rise to the ADIT liabilities.


Accounting for Environmental Reserves:

Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated.  Increases to estimates of environmental liabilities could have an adverse impact on earnings. We estimate these liabilities based on findings through various phases of the assessment, considering the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options (ranging from no action required to full site remediation and long-term monitoring), current site information from our site assessments, remediation estimates from third party engineering and remediation contractors, and our prior experience in remediating contaminated sites.  If a most likely action plan cannot yet be determined, we estimate the liability based on the low end of a range of possible action plans.  A significant portion of our environmental sites and reserve amounts relate to former MGP sites that were operated several decades ago and manufactured natural gas from coal and other processes, which resulted in certain by-products remaining in the environment that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment, for which we may have potential liability.  Estimates are based on the expected remediation plan. Our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new information from other sources, including the level of contamination at the site, the extent of our responsibility or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or a change in cost estimates due to certain economic factors.

Fair Value Measurements:

We follow fair value measurement guidance that defines fair value as the price that would be received for the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price).  We have applied this guidance to our Company's derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as "normal purchases or normal sales" (normal), to marketable securities held in trusts, and to our investments in our Pension and PBOP Plans.  Fair value measurements are also incorporated into the accounting for goodwill, long-lived assets and AROs.  We also applied this guidance in the valuation of our basis differences in our equity method offshore wind investments.  The fair value measurement guidance was also applied in estimating the fair value of preferred stock, long-term debt and RRBs.

Changes in fair value of the derivative contracts are recorded as Regulatory Assets or Liabilities, as we recover the costs of these contracts in rates charged to customers.  These valuations are sensitive to the prices of energy and energy-related products in future years for which markets have not yet developed and assumptions are made.

We use quoted market prices when available to determine the fair value of financial instruments.  If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is determined using quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments that are not active and model-derived valuations.  When quoted prices in active markets for the same or similar instruments are not available, we value derivative contracts using models that incorporate both observable and unobservable inputs.  Significant unobservable inputs utilized in the models include energy and energy-related product prices for future years for long-dated derivative contracts and market volatilities.  Discounted cash flow valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts, reflecting risk-adjusted profit that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using available historical market transaction information.  Valuations of derivative contracts also reflect our estimates of nonperformance risk, including credit risk.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – EVERSOURCE ENERGY AND SUBSIDIARIES

The following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for Eversource for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:

Operating Revenues

Sales Volumes:

A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes, our firm natural gas MMcf sales volumes, and our water MG sales volumes, and percentage changes, is as follows:

(1)

Effective February 1, 2018, NSTAR Electric operated entirely under a decoupled rate structure.  The 2018 sales volumes for NSTAR Electric have been recast to present January 2018 as decoupled to conform to the current year presentation.

(2)

Effective November 15, 2018, Yankee Gas operated under a decoupled rate structure.  The 2018 sales volumes for Yankee Gas have been recast to present 2018 as decoupled to conform to the current year presentation.

(3)

Special contracts are unique to Yankee Gas natural gas distribution customers who take service under such an arrangement and generally specify the amount of distribution revenue to be paid to Yankee Gas regardless of the customers' usage.

Weather, fluctuations in energy supply costs, conservation measures (including utility-sponsored energy efficiency programs), and economic conditions affect customer energy usage and water consumption.  Industrial sales volumes are less sensitive to temperature variations than residential and commercial sales volumes.  In our service territories, weather impacts both electric and water sales volumes during the summer and both electric and natural gas sales volumes during the winter; however, natural gas sales volumes are more sensitive to temperature variations than electric sales volumes.  Customer heating or cooling usage may not directly correlate with historical levels or with the level of degree-days that occur.

Fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH impact earnings ("Traditional" in the table above).  For CL&P, NSTAR Electric, Yankee Gas, and NSTAR Gas, fluctuations in retail sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission-approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms ("Decoupled" in the table above).  These distribution revenues are decoupled from their customer sales volumes, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues recognized.  Fluctuations in water sales volumes largely do not impact earnings as our Connecticut water distribution business is also decoupled.

Operating Revenues:

Operating Revenues by segment increased/(decreased) in


, as compared to


, as follows:

Electric and Natural Gas Distribution Revenues

:

Base Distribution Revenues:

•

Base electric distribution revenues increased $107.7 million in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the impact of CL&P's base distribution rate increases effective May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2018, which include recovery of storm costs and certain other items that do not impact earnings, an NSTAR Electric base distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2019, and a PSNH temporary base distribution rate increase effective July 1, 2019.

•

Base natural gas distribution revenues increased $7.6 million in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the impact of the Yankee Gas base distribution rate increase effective November 15, 2018.

Tracked Distribution Revenues:

Tracked distribution revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in retail rates through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings.  Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, energy supply and natural gas supply procurement and other energy-related costs, and electric retail transmission charges, which decreased significantly due primarily to the lower federal corporate income tax rate that was reflected effective January 1, 2019.  In addition, cost tracking mechanisms include energy efficiency program costs, electric restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), and additionally for NSTAR Electric, pension and PBOP benefits and net metering for distributed generation.  Tracked revenues also include wholesale market sales transactions, such as sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market and the sale of RECs to various counterparties.  However, tracked revenues do include certain incentives earned, return on rate base, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings.

Tracked distribution revenues increased/(decreased) in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

(1)

The decrease reflects a decrease in the retail transmission rate billed to customers that was adjusted on January 1, 2019 to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate.

Electric Transmission Revenues:

Electric transmission revenues increased

$102.7 million

in


, as compared to


, due primarily to continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and a higher recovery of tracked costs.

Other Revenues and Eliminations:

Other revenues primarily include the revenues of Eversource's service company, most of which are eliminated in consolidation.  Eliminations are also primarily related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business.


Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission

expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity and natural gas on behalf of our customers.  These electric and natural gas supply costs are recovered from customers in rates through commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs).  Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense increased/(decreased) in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

The increase in purchased power expense at the electric distribution business in


as compared to


, was driven primarily by a new zero-carbon power purchase agreement entered into in 2019, as required by regulation in Connecticut, from which the energy purchased from Millstone Nuclear Power Station is sold into the market.  Additionally, as a result of the sale of PSNH's thermal generation assets on January 10, 2018, and the sale of PSNH's hydroelectric assets on August 26, 2018, PSNH purchased power in place of its self-generation output.  The increase in natural gas supply costs at our natural gas distribution business was due primarily to higher average sales volumes.

The decrease in transmission costs in


, as compared to


, was primarily the result of a decrease in the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers, and a decrease in costs billed by ISO-NE that support regional grid investments. The retail transmission rate was adjusted on January 1, 2019 to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate, resulting in a decrease in the cost of retail transmission service.  This was partially offset by an increase in Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network.

Operations and Maintenance

expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base electric, natural gas and water distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs).  Operations and Maintenance expense increased/(decreased) in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

Depreciation

expense increased in


, as compared to


, due primarily to higher utility plant in service balances and new depreciation rates effective with the CL&P distribution rate case settlement agreement.

Amortization

expense includes the deferral of energy supply and energy-related costs included in certain regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms, and the amortization of certain costs.  This deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues.  Energy supply and energy-related costs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.  Amortization decreased in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the deferral of energy supply and energy-related costs at CL&P and PSNH, partially offset by an increase in storm cost recovery at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, and by increased amortization of PSNH's securitized regulatory asset related to the May 2018 RRB issuance of $15.7 million.

Energy Efficiency Programs

expense increased in


, as compared to


, due primarily to an increase in spending for CL&P's and PSNH's energy efficiency programs.  The costs for the majority of the state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.

CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH energy efficiency programs will include additional authorized spending totaling approximately $60 million in 2020, as compared to 2019.


Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

expense decreased in


, as compared to


, due primarily to a decrease of $25.4 million related to CL&P's remittance of energy efficiency funds to the State of Connecticut.  Energy efficiency funds collected from CL&P's customers after July 1, 2019 are no longer subject to remittance to the State of Connecticut.  The decrease is also due to amounts received by PSNH in the third quarter of 2019 relating to a refund of property taxes as a result of a settlement with the town of Bow, New Hampshire ($8.3 million).

Impairment of Northern Pass Transmission

reflects an impairment charge of $239.6 million that was recorded in the second quarter of 2019 as a result of the July 19, 2019 New Hampshire Supreme Court decision.  The after-tax impact of this impairment charge was $204.4 million.

Interest Expense

increased in


, as compared to


, due primarily to an increase in interest on long-term debt as a result of new debt issuances ($38.9 million), an increase in interest due to the May 2018 PSNH RRB issuance ($6.7 million) and an increase in interest on notes payable ($4.1 million).  Partially offsetting these increases were an increase in AFUDC related to debt funds ($5.9 million) and higher other capitalized interest ($17.0 million).

Other Income, Net

increased in


, as compared to


, due primarily to an increase in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates related to Eversource's equity method investments, net of impairment (

$38.4 million

) and investment income in 2019 compared to investment losses in 2018 ($4.8 million).  In 2018, Eversource recognized a $32.9 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to our equity method investment in the Access Northeast project, which was reflected as a loss within equity in earnings.  Partially offsetting these increases were a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components (

$29.5 million

), lower gains on sales of property ($4.8 million), and a decrease in the recognition of the equity component of the carrying charges related to storm costs recorded in interest income at PSNH ($2.4 million).

Income Tax Expense

decreased in 2019, as compared to 2018, due primarily to amortization of EDIT ($32.4 million), by the impairment of NPT in 2019, compared to the write-off of Access Northeast in 2018 ($37.8 million), partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings ($15.0 million), by items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($8.4 million), an increase in valuation allowance against state tax credits ($13.3 million), and due to the offset of one-time items relating to federal tax reform and release of tax reserve in 2018 ($18.0 million) that did not occur in 2019.  The impact of the amortization of the EDIT regulatory liability, including the tax gross up portion, that reduced revenue was $51.5 million, offset by current tax benefits of $14.1 million and amortization of EDIT of $37.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019, which results in no impact on earnings.


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS –

THE CONNECTICUT LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY

NSTAR ELECTRIC COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARY

PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE AND SUBSIDIARIES

The following provides the amounts and variances in operating revenues and expense line items in the statements of income for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and


included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K:

Operating Revenues

Sales Volumes:

A summary of our retail electric GWh sales volumes was as follows:

Fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes at PSNH impact earnings.  For CL&P and NSTAR Electric, fluctuations in retail electric sales volumes do not impact earnings due to their respective regulatory commission-approved distribution revenue decoupling mechanisms.

Operating Revenues:

Operating Revenues, which consist of base distribution revenues and tracked revenues further described below, increased

$136.4 million

at CL&P and

$18.3 million

at PSNH, and decreased

$68.3 million

at NSTAR Electric in


, as compared to


.

Base Distribution Revenues:

•

CL&P's distribution revenues increased $60.8 million due primarily to the impact of its base distribution rate increases effective May 1, 2019 and May 1, 2018, which include recovery of storm costs and certain other items that do not impact earnings.

•

NSTAR Electric's distribution revenues increased $27.3 million due primarily to the impact of its base distribution rate increase effective January 1, 2019.

•

PSNH's distribution revenues increased $19.6 million due primarily to the impact of its temporary base distribution rate increase effective July 1, 2019.

Tracked Revenues:

Tracked revenues consist of certain costs that are recovered from customers in retail rates through regulatory commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms and therefore, recovery of these costs has no impact on earnings.  Costs recovered through cost tracking mechanisms include, among others, energy supply procurement and other energy-related costs, and retail transmission charges, which decreased significantly due primarily to the lower federal corporate income tax rate that was reflected effective January 1, 2019.  In addition, cost tracking mechanisms include energy efficiency program costs, restructuring and stranded cost recovery revenues (including securitized RRB charges), and additionally for NSTAR Electric, pension and PBOP benefits and net metering for distributed generation.  Tracked revenues also include wholesale market sales transactions, such as sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market and the sale of RECs to various counterparties.   However, tracked revenues do include certain incentives earned, return on rate base, and carrying charges that are billed in rates to customers, which do impact earnings.


Tracked revenues increased/(decreased) in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

PSNH's energy supply procurement revenues include the absence in 2019 of the recovery of generation rate base return due to the sale of its thermal and hydroelectric generation assets in 2018.  Revenues from CL&P's other distribution tracking mechanisms include higher earnings from its capital tracker mechanism effective July 1, 2018 due to increased electric system improvements.

CL&P's wholesale market sales revenue increase was due primarily to a new zero-carbon power purchase agreement entered into in 2019, as required by regulation, from which the energy purchased from Millstone Nuclear Power Station is sold into the market. The decrease in retail transmission at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH reflects a decrease in the retail transmission rate billed to customers that was adjusted on January 1, 2019 to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate.

Transmission Revenues:

Transmission revenues increased $59.9 million at CL&P, $27.5 million at NSTAR Electric and $15.3 million at PSNH in


, as compared to


, due primarily to continued investment in our transmission infrastructure and a higher recovery of tracked costs.

Eliminations:

Eliminations are primarily related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business.  The impact of eliminations decreased revenues by

$27.8 million

at CL&P and

$13.0 million

at NSTAR Electric and increased revenues by

$4.5 million

at PSNH in


, as compared to


.

Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission

expense includes costs associated with purchasing electricity on behalf of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH's customers.  These energy supply costs are recovered from customers in rates through commission-approved cost tracking mechanisms, which have no impact on earnings (tracked costs).  Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense increased/(decreased) in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

Purchased Power Costs

:  Included in purchased power costs are the costs associated with providing electric generation service supply to all customers who have not migrated to third party suppliers and the cost of energy purchase contracts, as required by regulation.

•

The increase at CL&P was due primarily to a new zero-carbon power purchase agreement entered into in 2019, as required by regulation, from which the energy purchased from Millstone Nuclear Power Station is sold into the market.

•

The decrease at NSTAR Electric was due primarily to a decrease in the volume of power procured on behalf of our customers.

•

The increase at PSNH was due primarily to higher purchased power energy expenses that are recovered as a component of the Energy Service and Stranded Cost Recovery Charge tracking mechanisms.  As a result of the sale of its thermal generation assets on January 10, 2018 and its hydroelectric generation assets on August 26, 2018, PSNH has purchased power in place of its self-generation output.

Transmission Costs

:  Included in transmission costs are charges that recover the cost of transporting electricity over high-voltage lines from generation facilities to substations, including costs allocated by ISO-NE to maintain the wholesale electric market.

•

The decrease in transmission costs at CL&P was primarily the result of a decrease in costs billed by ISO-NE that support regional grid investment.  This was partially offset by an increase in the retail transmission cost deferral, which reflects the actual costs of transmission service compared to estimated amounts billed to customers and an increase in Local Network Service charges, which reflect the cost of transmission service provided by Eversource over our local transmission network.

•

The decrease in transmission costs at NSTAR Electric and PSNH was primarily the result of a decrease in costs billed by ISO-NE that support regional grid investment and a decrease in the retail transmission cost deferral.  This was partially offset by an increase in Local Network Service charges.

•

The decrease in transmission costs at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH also pertains to a reduction to the retail transmission rate that was adjusted on January 1, 2019 to reflect the lower federal corporate income tax rate, resulting in a decrease in the cost of retail transmission service.

Operations and Maintenance

expense includes tracked costs and costs that are part of base distribution rates with changes impacting earnings (non-tracked costs).  Operations and Maintenance expense increased/(decreased) in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

Depreciation

increased in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

•

The increase at CL&P was due to higher net plant in service balances and the implementation of new depreciation rates effective with the 2018 CL&P distribution rate case settlement agreement.

•

The increase at NSTAR Electric was due to higher net plant in service balances.

•

The increase at PSNH was due to higher distribution depreciation expense, partially offset by the sale of the thermal and hydroelectric generation assets in 2018.

Amortization of Regulatory Assets, Net

expense includes the deferral of energy supply and energy-related costs included in certain regulatory-approved cost tracking mechanisms, and the amortization of certain costs.  This deferral adjusts expense to match the corresponding revenues.  Energy supply and energy-related costs are recovered from customers in rates and have no impact on earnings.

•

The increase at NSTAR Electric in


, as compared to


, was due primarily to an increase in both storm cost recovery and costs associated with low income customers.  The remaining increase in amortization was driven by the deferral of energy supply and energy-related costs, which can fluctuate from period to period based on the timing of costs incurred and related rate changes to recover these costs.

•

The decrease at CL&P and PSNH was due primarily to the deferral of energy supply and energy-related costs, partially offset by an increase in storm cost recovery.  The decrease at PSNH is also partially offset by $15.7 million of higher amortization of PSNH's securitized regulatory asset related to the May 2018 RRB issuance.

Energy Efficiency Programs

expense

includes costs of various state energy policy initiatives and expanded energy efficiency programs that are recovered from customers in rates, most of which have no impact on earnings.  Energy Efficiency Programs expense

increased/(decreased) in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

•

The increase at CL&P and PSNH was due to higher spending for energy efficiency programs.

•

The decrease at NSTAR Electric was due to the timing of spending on certain large energy efficiency projects in 2019.

CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH energy efficiency programs will include additional authorized spending of approximately $5 million, $40 million, and $15 million, respectively, in 2020 as compared to 2019.

Taxes Other Than Income Taxes

decreased in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

•

The decrease at CL&P was due to a decrease of $25.4 million related to CL&P's remittance of energy efficiency funds to the State of Connecticut.  Energy efficiency funds collected from customers after July 1, 2019 are no longer subject to remittance to the State of Connecticut.  The decrease was partially offset by higher property taxes as a result of higher utility plant balances and higher gross earnings taxes (the costs of which are tracked).

•

The decrease at PSNH was due to lower property taxes and a refund of property taxes as a result of a settlement with the town of Bow, New Hampshire ($8.3 million).


Interest Expense

increased/(decreased) in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

•

The decrease at CL&P was due to lower interest on long-term debt ($2.6 million), an increase in AFUDC related to debt funds ($0.8 million), and lower amortization of debt discounts and premiums, net ($0.8 million), partially offset by an increase in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($2.2 million) and an increase in interest on notes payable ($1.4 million).

•

The

increase at NSTAR Electric was due to higher interest on long-term debt ($8.1 million).

•

Interest expense at PSNH did not significantly change as the increase in interest due to the May 2018 RRB issuance ($6.7 million) was offset by a decrease in interest expense on regulatory deferrals ($3.1 million), a decrease in interest on notes payable ($2.0 million) and an increase in AFUDC related to debt funds ($1.5 million).

Other Income, Net

decreased in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

•

The decrease at CL&P was due to a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components (

$9.0 million

), partially offset by investment income in 2019 compared to investment losses in 2018 (

$5.3 million

).

•

The decrease at NSTAR Electric was due to a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components (

$12.5 million

) and an increase in investment losses in 2019 compared to 2018 ($2.7 million), partially offset by an increase in AFUDC related to equity funds (

$4.2 million

) and an increase in amounts related to officers' life insurance policies ($2.8 million).

•

The decrease at PSNH was due to a decrease related to pension, SERP and PBOP non-service income components (

$5.0 million

), the absence in 2019 of a gain on the sale of property ($4.4 million) and a decrease in the recognition of the equity component of the carrying charges related to storm costs recorded in interest income ($2.4 million).  Partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in AFUDC related to equity funds (

$3.4 million

).

Income Tax Expense

increased/(decreased) in


, as compared to


, due primarily to the following:

•

The increase at CL&P was due to higher pre-tax earnings ($8.6 million) and an increase in a valuation allowance against state tax credits ($9.8 million).  These increases were partially offset by amortization of EDIT ($5.8 million), return to provision ($3.0 million), lower state taxes ($1.3 million), and by items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($0.4 million).  The impact of the amortization of the EDIT regulatory liability, including the tax gross up portion, that reduced revenue was $7.9 million, offset by a current tax benefit of $2.1 million and amortization of EDIT of $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which results in no impact on earnings.

•

The decrease at NSTAR Electric was due to amortization of EDIT ($22.9 million), return to provision ($1.3 million), items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($6.3 million) and partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings ($5.4 million) and higher state taxes ($1.5 million).  The impact of the amortization of the EDIT regulatory liability, including the tax gross up portion, that reduced revenue was $31.5 million, offset by a current tax benefit of $8.6 million and amortization of EDIT of $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which results in no impact on earnings.

•

The decrease at PSNH was due to lower state taxes ($4.4 million), return to provision ($1.1 million), and items that impact our tax rate as a result of regulatory treatment (flow-through items) and permanent differences ($3.8 million).  These decreases were partially offset by higher pre-tax earnings ($2.7 million).  The impact of the amortization of the EDIT regulatory liability, including the tax gross up portion, that reduced revenue was $5.6 million, offset by a current tax benefit of $1.6 million and amortization of EDIT of $4.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which results in no impact on earnings.

Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk

Market Risk Information

Commodity Price Risk Management:

Our regulated companies enter into energy contracts to serve our customers, and the economic impacts of those contracts are passed on to our customers.  Accordingly, the regulated companies have no exposure to loss of future earnings or fair values due to these market risk-sensitive instruments.  Eversource's Energy Supply Risk Committee, comprised of senior officers, reviews and approves all large-scale energy related transactions entered into by its regulated companies.

Other Risk Management Activities

We have an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program for identifying the principal risks of the Company.  Our ERM program involves the application of a well-defined, enterprise-wide methodology designed to allow our Risk Committee, comprised of our senior officers of the Company, to identify, categorize, prioritize, and mitigate the principal risks to the Company.  The ERM program is integrated with other assurance functions throughout the Company including Compliance, Auditing, and Insurance to ensure appropriate coverage of risks that could impact the Company.

In addition to known risks, ERM identifies emerging risks to the Company, through participation in industry groups, discussions with management and in consultation with outside advisers.  Our management then analyzes risks to determine materiality, likelihood and impact, and develops mitigation strategies.  Management broadly considers our business model, the utility industry, the global economy, climate change, sustainability and the current environment to identify risks.  The Finance Committee of the Board of Trustees is responsible for oversight of the Company's ERM program and enterprise-wide risks as well as specific risks associated with insurance, credit, financing, investments, pensions and overall system security including cyber security.  The findings of the ERM process are periodically discussed with the Finance Committee of our Board of Trustees, as well as with other Board Committees or the full Board of Trustees, as appropriate, including reporting on how these issues are being measured and managed.  However, there can be no assurances that the ERM process will identify or manage every risk or event that could impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Interest Rate Risk Management:

We manage our interest rate risk exposure in accordance with our written policies and procedures by maintaining a mix of fixed and variable rate long-term debt.  As of

December 31, 2019

, all of our long-term debt except for $

11.6 million

of fees and interest due for CYAPC's spent nuclear fuel disposal costs, was at a fixed interest rate.

Credit Risk Management:

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that we would incur as a result of non-performance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of our contractual obligations.  We serve a wide variety of customers and transact with suppliers that include IPPs, industrial companies, natural gas and electric utilities, oil and natural gas producers, financial institutions, and other energy marketers.  Margin accounts exist within this diverse group, and we realize interest receipts and payments related to balances outstanding in these margin accounts.  This wide customer and supplier mix generates a need for a variety of contractual structures, products and terms that, in turn, require us to manage the portfolio of market risk inherent in those transactions in a manner consistent with the parameters established by our risk management process.

Our regulated companies are subject to credit risk from certain long-term or high-volume supply contracts with energy marketing companies.  Our regulated companies manage the credit risk with these counterparties in accordance with established credit risk practices and monitor contracting risks, including credit risk.  As of

December 31, 2019

, our regulated companies held collateral (letters of credit or cash) of $20.0 million from counterparties related to our standard service contracts.  As of

December 31, 2019

, Eversource had $19.3 million of cash posted with ISO-NE related to energy transactions.

For further information on cash collateral deposited and posted with counterparties, see Note 1O, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Supplemental Cash Flow Information," to the financial statements.

If the respective unsecured debt ratings of Eversource or its subsidiaries were reduced to below investment grade by either Moody's or S&P, certain of Eversource's contracts would require additional collateral in the form of cash to be provided to counterparties and independent system operators.  Eversource would have been and remains able to provide that collateral.

Company Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

Eversource Energy

Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Eversource Energy and subsidiaries (Eversource or the Company) and of other sections of this annual report.  Eversource's internal controls over financial reporting were audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting.  The Company's internal control framework and processes have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  There are inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting that could allow material misstatements due to error or fraud to occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees during the normal course of business.  Additionally, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate in the future due to changes in the business environment.

Under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, Eversource conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on this evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of

December 31, 2019

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, of the Company and our report dated

February 26, 2020

, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.

Basis for Opinion

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Company Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matter

The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.

Regulatory Accounting - Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Note 2 to the Financial Statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s utility companies are subject to rate regulation by one or more of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire state public utility authorities (the “Commissions”) that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses.  The regulated companies’ financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process.  The rates charged to the customers of the Company’s regulated companies are designed to collect each company’s cost to provide service, plus a return on investment.

The application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities.  Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates.  In some cases, the Company records regulatory assets before approval for recovery has been received from the applicable regulatory commission.  The Company must use judgment to conclude that costs deferred as regulatory assets are probable of future recovery.  The Company bases its conclusion on certain factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory precedent.  Regulatory liabilities represent either revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.

The Company uses judgment when recording regulatory assets and liabilities; however, regulatory commissions can reach different conclusions about the recovery of costs, and those conclusions could have a material impact on the financial statements.  Management believes it is probable that each of the regulated companies will recover its respective investment in long-lived assets, including regulatory assets.  If management were to determine that it could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to any of the regulated companies' operations, or if management could not conclude it is probable that costs would be recovered from customers in future rates, the costs would be charged to net income in the period in which the determination is made.


Accounting for the economics of rate-regulation impacts multiple financial statement line items and disclosures, such as regulated property, plant, and equipment, regulatory assets and liabilities, operating revenues and depreciation expense. While management has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the Commissions will not approve full recovery of such costs or full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment. We identified the impact of rate-regulation as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing the probability of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and a refund to customers. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments requires specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate setting process due to its inherent complexities.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the Commissions included the following, among others:

We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates, a refund, or a future reduction in rates.

We evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the applicability and impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments disclosed in the financial statements.

We read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions for the Company and other public utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future refund or reduction in rates based on precedence of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.

For regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the Commissions and the filings with the Commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions

.

We obtained the regulatory orders and analysis from management that support the probability of recovery, refund, or future reductions in rates for regulatory assets and liabilities to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery, refund, or a future reduction in rates.

Company Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting

The Connecticut Light and Power Company

Management is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the accompanying financial statements of The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P or the Company) and of other sections of this annual report.

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting.  The Company's internal control framework and processes have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  There are inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting that could allow material misstatements due to error or fraud to occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees during the normal course of business.  Additionally, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate in the future due to changes in the business environment.

Under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, CL&P conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on this evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

A.     About Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH

Eversource Energy is a public utility holding company primarily engaged, through its wholly-owned regulated utility subsidiaries, in the energy delivery business.  Eversource Energy's wholly-owned regulated utility subsidiaries consist of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH (electric utilities), Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas (natural gas utilities) and Aquarion (water utilities).  Eversource provides energy delivery and/or water service to approximately

four million

electric, natural gas and water customers through

eight

regulated utilities in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.

Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are reporting companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Eversource Energy is a public utility holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005.  Arrangements among the regulated electric companies and other Eversource companies, outside agencies and other utilities covering interconnections, interchange of electric power and sales of utility property are subject to regulation by the FERC.  Eversource's regulated companies are subject to regulation of rates, accounting and other matters by the FERC and/or applicable state regulatory commissions (the PURA for CL&P, Yankee Gas and Aquarion, the DPU for NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and Aquarion, and the NHPUC for PSNH and Aquarion).

CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH furnish franchised retail electric service in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas are engaged in the distribution and sale of natural gas to customers within Connecticut and Massachusetts, respectively.  Aquarion is engaged in the collection, treatment and distribution of water in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH's results include the operations of their respective distribution and transmission businesses.  The distribution business also includes the results of NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities and PSNH's generation facilities prior to sale in 2018.  PSNH completed the sales of all its thermal and hydroelectric generation assets in 2018.  See Note 14, "Generation Asset Sale," for further information.

Eversource Service, Eversource's service company, and several wholly-owned real estate subsidiaries of Eversource, provide support services to Eversource, including its regulated companies.

B.

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements of Eversource, NSTAR Electric and PSNH include the accounts of each of their respective subsidiaries.   Intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The accompanying consolidated financial statements of Eversource, NSTAR Electric and PSNH and the financial statements of CL&P are herein collectively referred to as the "financial statements."

The preparation of the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Eversource consolidates the operations of CYAPC and YAEC, both of which are inactive regional nuclear generation companies engaged in the long-term storage of their spent nuclear fuel.  Eversource consolidates CYAPC and YAEC because CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's and PSNH's combined ownership and voting interests in each of these entities is greater than 50 percent.  Intercompany transactions between CL&P, NSTAR Electric, PSNH and the CYAPC and YAEC companies have been eliminated in consolidation of the Eversource financial statements.

Eversource's consolidated financial information includes the results of Aquarion and its subsidiaries beginning from the date of the acquisition on December 4, 2017.

Eversource holds several equity ownership interests that are not consolidated and are accounted for under the equity method.

In accordance with accounting guidance on noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements, the Preferred Stock of CL&P and the Preferred Stock of NSTAR Electric, which are not owned by Eversource or its consolidated subsidiaries and are not subject to mandatory redemption, have been presented as noncontrolling interests in the financial statements of Eversource.  The Preferred Stock of CL&P and the Preferred Stock of NSTAR Electric are considered to be temporary equity and have been classified between liabilities and permanent shareholders' equity on the balance sheets of Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric due to a provision in the preferred stock agreements of both CL&P and NSTAR Electric that grant preferred stockholders the right to elect a majority of the CL&P and NSTAR Electric Boards of Directors, respectively, should certain conditions exist, such as if preferred dividends are in arrears for a specified amount of time.  The Net Income reported in the statements of income and cash flows represents net income prior to apportionment to noncontrolling interests, which is represented by dividends on preferred stock of CL&P and NSTAR Electric.


Eversource's utility subsidiaries' electric, natural gas and water distribution and transmission businesses are subject to rate-regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for entities with rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the differences in the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses from those of other businesses and industries.  See Note 2, "Regulatory Accounting," for further information.

Certain reclassifications of prior year data were made in the accompanying financial statements to conform to the current year presentation.

The Eversource and PSNH 2018 statements of cash flows, the 2018 supplemental cash flow information footnote, and the 2018 segment footnote were revised to correct an error in the presentation of non-cash capital additions.  The impact of this revision on the statement of cash flows is an increase to operating cash inflows in Accounts Payable of

$

46.6

million

and a corresponding increase to investing cash outflows in Investments in Property, Plant and Equipment for the year ended December 31, 2018.  This revision is not deemed material, individually or in the aggregate, to the previously issued financial statements.

As of both

December 31, 2019

and


, Eversource's carrying amount of goodwill was

$

4.43

billion

.  Eversource performs an assessment for possible impairment of its goodwill at least annually.  Eversource completed its annual goodwill impairment test for each of its reporting units as of October 1,


and determined that no impairment exists.  See Note 25B, "Acquisition of Aquarion and Goodwill - Goodwill," for further information.

C.

Accounting Standards

Accounting Standards Issued but Not Yet Effective:

In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13,

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326),

which provides a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments based on an estimate of current expected credit losses.  Under the new guidance, immediate recognition of credit losses expected over the life of a financial instrument is required.  The standard is effective January 1, 2020.  The Company assessed the impacts of this standard on the accounting for credit losses on its financial instruments, including accounts receivable, and does not expect a material impact on the financial statements of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric or PSNH.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12,

Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes

, which eliminates certain exceptions to the general principles of current income tax guidance in ASC 740, Income Taxes, and simplifies and improves consistency in application of that income tax guidance through clarifications of, and amendments to, ASC 740.  The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021.  The Company is evaluating the impact of this standard on the financial statements of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.

Accounting Standards Recently Adopted:

On January 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02,

Leases (Topic 842),

which amended existing lease accounting guidance.  The Company applied the Topic 842 lease criteria to new leases and lease renewals entered into effective on or after January 1, 2019.

The ASU required balance sheet recognition of leases deemed to be operating leases as well as additional disclosure requirements.  The recognition, measurement and presentation of expenses and cash flows were not significantly changed.

The Company utilized the modified retrospective transition method allowed in ASU 2018-11,

Leases (Topic 842) - Targeted Improvements

, which allowed the Company to adopt the new leases standard as of January 1, 2019, with prior periods presented in the financial statements continuing to follow existing lease accounting guidance under Topic 840 (Leases) in the accounting literature.  Implementation of ASU 2018-11 had no effect on retained earnings, and the requirements of the new lease standard (Topic 842) are reflected in the 2019 financial statements and footnotes.

The Company elected the practical expedient package whereby it did not need to reassess whether or not an existing contract is or contains a lease or whether a lease is an operating or capital lease, and it did not need to reassess initial direct costs for leases.  Election of this practical expedient allowed us to carry forward our historical lease classifications.  The Company elected the practical expedient to not reevaluate land easements existing at adoption if they were not previously accounted for as leases.  The Company also elected to use the discount rate as of the January 1, 2019 implementation date to discount its operating lease liabilities.  The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient to determine the lease term for existing leases.

The Company determined the impact the ASUs had on its financial statements by reviewing its lease population and identifying lease data needed for the disclosure requirements.  The Company implemented a new lease accounting system in 2019 to ensure ongoing compliance with the ASU’s requirements.  Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of operating lease liabilities and right-of-use assets on the balance sheet upon transition at January 1, 2019 of

$

58.0

million

at Eversource,

$

25.3

million

at NSTAR Electric,

$

0.6

million

at CL&P, and

$

0.6

million

at PSNH.  Implementation of the new guidance did not have an impact on each company’s results of operations or cash flows.

D.     Impairment of Northern Pass Transmission

Northern Pass was Eversource's planned

1,090

MW HVDC transmission line that would have interconnected from the Québec-New Hampshire border to Franklin, New Hampshire and an associated alternating current radial transmission line between Franklin and Deerfield, New Hampshire.  As a result of a final decision received on July 19, 2019 from the New Hampshire Supreme Court, whereby the court denied Northern Pass’ appeal and affirmed the NHSEC’s denial of Northern Pass’ siting application on NPT, Eversource concluded that construction of NPT was no longer probable and that there was no constructive path forward for the project.  Eversource terminated the project and permanently abandoned any further development.  As a result, substantially all of the capitalized project costs, which totaled

$


million

, certain of which are subject to cost reimbursement agreements, were impaired.


Based on the conclusion that the construction of Northern Pass was no longer probable, Eversource recorded an impairment charge in 2019 for all of the project costs associated with Northern Pass, which were primarily engineering design, siting, permitting and legal costs, along with appropriate allowances for funds used during construction, and recognized a receivable for certain cost reimbursement agreements.  Additionally, Eversource recorded an impairment charge associated with the land acquired to construct Northern Pass in order to recognize the land at its estimated fair value based on assessed values and transaction costs.  In total, this resulted in a pre-tax impairment charge of

$

239.6

million

within Operating Income on the statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2019, and was reflected in the Electric Transmission segment.  The after-tax impact of the impairment charge was

$

204.4

million

, or

$

0.64

per share, after giving effect to the estimated fair value of the related land, reimbursement agreements, and the impact of expected income tax benefits associated with the impairment charge.  As a result of the decision to terminate the NPT project and permanently abandon any further development, Eversource does not expect any future cash expenditures associated with this project.

E.

Cash

Cash includes cash on hand.  At the end of each reporting period, any overdraft amounts are reclassified from Cash to Accounts Payable on the balance sheets.

F.

Provision for Uncollectible Accounts

Eversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, presents its receivables at estimated net realizable value by maintaining a provision for uncollectible accounts.  This provision is determined based upon a variety of judgments and factors, including the application of an estimated uncollectible percentage to each receivable aging category.  The estimate is based upon historical collection and write-off experience and management's assessment of collectability from customers.  Management continuously assesses the collectability of receivables and adjusts collectability estimates based on actual experience.  Receivable balances are written off against the provision for uncollectible accounts when the customer accounts are terminated and these balances are deemed to be uncollectible.

The PURA allows CL&P and Yankee Gas to accelerate the recovery of accounts receivable balances attributable to qualified customers under financial or medical duress (uncollectible hardship accounts receivable) outstanding for greater than


days and


days, respectively.  The DPU allows NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas to recover in rates, amounts associated with certain uncollectible hardship accounts receivable.  These uncollectible hardship customer account balances are included in Regulatory Assets or Other Long-Term Assets on the balance sheets.

The total provision for uncollectible accounts is included in Receivables, Net on the balance sheets.  The provision for uncollectible hardship accounts is included in the total uncollectible provision balance.

The provision balances were as follows:

Uncollectible expense associated with customers' accounts receivable included in Operations and Maintenance expense on the statements of income was as follows:

Fuel, Materials, Supplies and REC Inventory

Fuel, Materials, Supplies and REC Inventory include natural gas inventory, materials and supplies purchased primarily for construction or operation and maintenance purposes, and RECs.  Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  RECs are purchased from suppliers of renewable sources of generation and are used to meet state mandated Renewable Portfolio Standards requirements.

The carrying amounts of fuel, materials and supplies, and RECs, which are included in Current Assets on the balance sheets, were as follows:

I.

Fair Value Measurements

Fair value measurement guidance is applied to derivative contracts that are not elected or designated as "normal purchases" or "normal sales" (normal) and to the marketable securities held in trusts.  Fair value measurement guidance is also applied to valuations of the investments used to calculate the funded status of pension and PBOP plans, the nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets such as goodwill, long-lived assets and AROs. We also applied this guidance in the valuation of our basis differences in our equity method offshore wind investments (see Note 6, "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates," for further information). The fair value measurement guidance was also applied in estimating the fair value of preferred stock, long-term debt and RRBs.

Fair Value Hierarchy:

In measuring fair value, Eversource uses observable market data when available in order to minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  Inputs used in fair value measurements are categorized into three fair value hierarchy levels for disclosure purposes.  The entire fair value measurement is categorized based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Eversource evaluates the classification of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a quarterly basis, and Eversource's policy is to recognize transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the end of the reporting period.  The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:

Level 1 - Inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.  Active markets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.

Level 2 - Inputs are quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which all significant inputs are observable.

Level 3 - Quoted market prices are not available.  Fair value is derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or assumptions are unobservable.  Where possible, valuation techniques incorporate observable market inputs that can be validated to external sources such as industry exchanges, including prices of energy and energy-related products.

Uncategorized - Investments that are measured at net asset value are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy.

Determination of Fair Value:

The valuation techniques and inputs used in Eversource's fair value measurements are described in Note 4, "Derivative Instruments," Note 5, "Marketable Securities," Note 6, "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates," Note 7, "Asset Retirement Obligations," Note 11A, "Employee Benefits – Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension," Note 16, "Fair Value of Financial Instruments" and Note 25B, "Acquisition of Aquarion and Goodwill - Goodwill" to the financial statements.

J.

Derivative Accounting

Many of the electric and natural gas companies' contracts for the purchase and sale of energy or energy-related products are derivatives.  The accounting treatment for energy contracts entered into varies and depends on the intended use of the particular contract and on whether or not the contract is a derivative.

The application of derivative accounting is complex and requires management judgment in the following respects: identification of derivatives and embedded derivatives, election and designation of a contract as normal, and determination of the fair value of derivative contracts.  All of these judgments can have a significant impact on the financial statements.  The judgment applied in the election of a contract as normal (and resulting accrual accounting) includes the conclusion that it is probable at the inception of the contract and throughout its term that it will result in physical delivery of the underlying product and that the quantities will be used or sold by the business in the normal course of business.  If facts and circumstances change and management can no longer support this conclusion, then a contract cannot be considered normal, accrual accounting is terminated, and fair value accounting is applied prospectively.

The fair value of derivative contracts is based upon the contract terms and conditions and the underlying market price or fair value per unit.  When quantities are not specified in the contract, the Company determines whether the contract has a determinable quantity by using amounts referenced in default provisions and other relevant sections of the contract.  The fair value of derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are offset and recorded as a net derivative asset or liability on the balance sheets.

Regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded to offset the fair values of derivative contracts related to energy and energy-related products, as contract settlements are recovered from, or refunded to, customers in future rates.  All changes in the fair value of derivative contracts are recorded as regulatory assets or liabilities and do not impact net income.

For further information regarding derivative contracts, see Note 4, "Derivative Instruments," to the financial statements.

K.     Operating Expenses

Costs related to fuel and natural gas included in Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission on the statements of income were as follows:

PSNH completed the sale of its generation assets in 2018.  See Note 14, "Generation Asset Sale," for further information.

L.

Allowance for Funds Used During Construction

AFUDC represents the cost of borrowed and equity funds used to finance construction and is included in the cost of the electric, natural gas and water companies' utility plant on the balance sheet.  The portion of AFUDC attributable to borrowed funds is recorded as a reduction of Interest Expense, and the AFUDC related to equity funds is recorded as Other Income, Net on the statements of income.  AFUDC costs are recovered from customers over the service life of the related plant in the form of increased revenue collected as a result of higher depreciation expense.

The average AFUDC rate is based on a FERC-prescribed formula using the cost of a company's short-term financings and capitalization (preferred stock, long-term debt and common equity), as appropriate.  The average rate is applied to average eligible CWIP amounts to calculate AFUDC.

AFUDC costs and the weighted-average AFUDC rates were as follows:


M.     Other Income, Net

The components of Other Income, Net on the statements of income were as follows:

(1)

Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes an other-than-temporary impairment of

$

32.9

million

of the Access Northeast project investment for the year ended December 31, 2018.  See Note 6, "Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates," for further information.  Equity in earnings includes

$

20.4

million

,

$

17.6

million

and

$

9.7

million

of pre-tax unrealized gains for the years ended December 31,


,


and


, respectively, associated with an equity method investment in a renewable energy fund.

For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, PSNH recognized

$

6.3

million

and

$

8.7

million

, respectively, of interest income for the equity return component of carrying charges on storm costs approved in 2019 and 2018.  See Note 2, "Regulatory Accounting," for further information.

N.

Other Taxes

Eversource's companies that serve customers in Connecticut collect gross receipts taxes levied by the state of Connecticut from their customers.

These gross receipts taxes are recorded separately with collections in Operating Revenues and with payments in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes on the statements of income as follows:

As agents for state and local governments, Eversource's companies that serve customers in Connecticut and Massachusetts collect certain sales taxes that are recorded on a net basis with no impact on the statements of income.

Separate from above were amounts recorded as Taxes Other Than Income Taxes related to the remittance to the State of Connecticut of energy efficiency funds collected from customers in Operating Revenues.  These amounts were

$

21.4

million

and

$

46.8

million

in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Energy efficiency funds collected from customers after July 1, 2019 are no longer subject to remittance to the State of Connecticut.   These amounts were recorded separately, with collections in Operating Revenues and with payments in Taxes Other Than Income Taxes on the Eversource and CL&P statements of income.


O.     Supplemental Cash Flow Information

(1)

See Note 1B, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Basis of Presentation," for information regarding the correction of non-cash capital additions at Eversource and PSNH reported as of December 31, 2018.

Beginning in 2019, Eversource began issuing treasury shares to satisfy awards under the Company's incentive plans, shares issued under the dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, and matching contributions under the Eversource 401k Plan.  The issuance of treasury shares represents a non-cash transaction, as the treasury shares were used to fulfill Eversource's obligations that require the issuance of common shares.

The following table reconciles cash as reported on the balance sheets to the cash and restricted cash balance as reported on the statements of cash flows:

Special Deposits represent cash collections related to the PSNH RRB customer charges that are held in trust and required ISO-NE cash deposits, and are included in Current Assets on the balance sheets.  Restricted cash included in Marketable Securities represents money market funds held in trusts to fund certain non-qualified executive benefits and restricted trusts to fund CYAPC and YAEC's spent nuclear fuel storage obligations.

Q.     Acquisition of Assets of Columbia Gas of Massachusetts

On February 26, 2020, Eversource and NiSource entered into an asset purchase agreement (the Agreement) pursuant to which Eversource would acquire the assets that comprise NiSource’s local gas distribution business in Massachusetts, which is doing business as Columbia Gas of Massachusetts (CMA). The purchase price of

$

1.1

billion

includes a target working capital amount that would be adjusted to reflect actual working capital as of the closing date. The acquisition and resulting rate plan both require DPU and other approvals.

The liabilities to be assumed by Eversource under the Agreement specifically exclude any liabilities (past or future) arising out of or related to the fires and explosions that occurred on September 13, 2018 in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Massachusetts related to the delivery of natural gas by CMA, including certain subsequent events, all as described and in the DPU's Order on Scope dated December 23, 2019 (D.P.U. 19-141) (the Greater Lawrence Incident or GLI), and any further emergency events prior to the closing of the acquisition related to the restoration and reconstruction with respect to the GLI, including any losses arising out of or related to any litigation, demand, cause of action, claim, suit, investigation, proceeding, indemnification agreements or rights.

2.

REGULATORY ACCOUNTING

Eversource's utility companies are subject to rate regulation that is based on cost recovery and meets the criteria for application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, which considers the effect of regulation on the timing of the recognition of certain revenues and expenses.  The regulated companies' financial statements reflect the effects of the rate-making process.  The rates charged to the customers of Eversource's regulated companies are designed to collect each company's costs to provide service, plus a return on investment.

The application of accounting guidance for rate-regulated enterprises results in recording regulatory assets and liabilities.  Regulatory assets represent the deferral of incurred costs that are probable of future recovery in customer rates.  Regulatory assets are amortized as the incurred costs are recovered through customer rates.  Regulatory liabilities represent either revenues received from customers to fund expected costs that have not yet been incurred or probable future refunds to customers.

Management believes it is probable that each of the regulated companies will recover its respective investments in long-lived assets, including regulatory assets.  If management were to determine that it could no longer apply the accounting guidance applicable to rate-regulated enterprises to any of the regulated companies' operations, or if management could not conclude it is probable that costs would be recovered from customers in future rates, the costs would be charged to net income in the period in which the determination is made.

Regulatory Assets:

The components of regulatory assets were as follows:

Benefit Costs:

Eversource's Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance on defined benefit pension and other PBOP plans.  The liability (or asset) recorded by the regulated companies to recognize the funded status of their retiree benefit plans is offset by a regulatory asset (or offset by a regulatory liability in the case of a benefit plan asset) in lieu of a charge to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss), reflecting ultimate recovery from customers through rates.  The regulatory asset (or regulatory liability) is amortized as the actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost are amortized to net periodic benefit cost for the pension and PBOP plans.  All amounts are remeasured annually.  Regulatory accounting is also applied to the portions of Eversource's service company costs that support the regulated companies, as these amounts are also recoverable.  As these regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities do not represent a cash outlay for the regulated companies, no carrying charge is recovered from customers.  See Note 11A, "Employee Benefits - Pensions and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension," for further information on regulatory benefit plan amounts recognized and amortized during the year.

CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH recover benefit costs related to their distribution and transmission operations from customers in rates as allowed by their applicable regulatory commissions.  NSTAR Electric recovers qualified pension and PBOP expenses related to its distribution operations through a rate reconciling mechanism that fully tracks the change in net pension and PBOP expenses each year.


Income Taxes, Net:

The tax effect of temporary book-tax differences (differences between the periods in which transactions affect income in the financial statements and the periods in which they affect the determination of taxable income, including those differences relating to uncertain tax positions) is accounted for in accordance with the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions and accounting guidance for income taxes.  Differences in income taxes between the accounting guidance and the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions are recorded as regulatory assets.  As these assets are offset by deferred income tax liabilities, no carrying charge is collected.  The amortization period of these assets varies depending on the nature and/or remaining life of the underlying assets and liabilities.  For further information regarding income taxes, see Note 12, "Income Taxes," to the financial statements.

Securitized Stranded Costs:

In 2018, a subsidiary of PSNH issued

$

635.7

million

of securitized RRBs to finance PSNH's unrecovered remaining costs associated with the divestiture of its generation assets.  Securitized regulatory assets, which are not earning an equity return, are being recovered over the amortization period of the associated RRBs. The PSNH RRBs are expected to be repaid by February 1, 2033.  For further information, see Note 10, "Rate Reduction Bonds and Variable Interest Entities."

Storm Restoration Costs, Net:

The storm restoration cost deferrals relate to costs incurred for storm events at CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that each company expects to recover from customers.  A storm must meet certain criteria to qualify for deferral and recovery with the criteria specific to each state jurisdiction and utility company.  Once a storm qualifies for recovery, all qualifying expenses incurred during storm restoration efforts are deferred and recovered from customers.  Costs for storms that do not meet the specific criteria are expensed as incurred.  In addition to storm restoration costs, CL&P and PSNH are each allowed to recover pre-staging storm costs.  Management believes storm restoration costs deferred were prudently incurred and meet the criteria for specific cost recovery in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, and that recovery from customers is probable through the applicable regulatory recovery processes.  Each electric utility company either recovers a carrying charge on its deferred storm restoration cost regulatory asset balance or the regulatory asset balance is included in rate base.

In 2019, several significant storms caused extensive damage to our electric distribution systems and customer outages.  These storms resulted in deferred storm restoration costs of approximately

$


million

(

$


million

for CL&P,

$


million

for NSTAR Electric, and

$


million

for PSNH), which were reflected in Storm Restoration Costs, Net in the table above as of

December 31, 2019

.

Storm Filings:  On November 16, 2018, CL&P filed for recovery of

$


million

of storm costs incurred from October 2017 through May 2018, with recovery over

six years

.  Through the course of the proceeding, CL&P updated its request to

$

145.5

million

to reflect final invoicing and capitalization amounts.  On April 17, 2019, PURA authorized recovery of

$

141.0

million

as part of storm cost recovery and the remainder to be recorded to plant or other balance sheet accounts.  CL&P began recovery of the

$

141.0

million

in distribution rates effective May 1, 2019.

On March 26, 2019, the NHPUC approved the recovery of

$

38.1

million

, plus carrying charges, of storm costs incurred from December 2013 through April 2016 and the transfer of funding from PSNH’s major storm reserve to recover those costs.  The costs of these storms (excluding the equity return component of the carrying charges) were deferred as regulatory assets, and the funding reserve collected from customers was accrued as a regulatory liability.  As a result of the duration of time between incurring storm costs in December 2013 through April 2016 and final approval from the NHPUC in 2019, PSNH recognized

$

5.2

million

(pre-tax) for the equity return component of the carrying charges within Other Income, Net on the statement of income in 2019, which has been collected from customers.  Also included in the March 26, 2019 NHPUC approval is a prospective requirement for PSNH to annually net its storm funding reserve collected from customers against deferred storm costs.

In addition, on June 27, 2019, the NHPUC approved a temporary rate settlement that allowed PSNH to recover approximately

$

68.5

million

in unrecovered storm costs over a five-year period beginning August 1, 2019, with debt carrying charges.

Regulatory Tracker Mechanisms:

The regulated companies' approved rates are designed to recover costs incurred to provide service to customers.  The regulated companies recover certain of their costs on a fully-reconciling basis through regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms.  The differences between the costs incurred (or the rate recovery allowed) and the actual revenues are recorded as regulatory assets (for undercollections) or as regulatory liabilities (for overcollections) to be included in future customer rates each year.  Carrying charges are recovered in rates on all material regulatory tracker mechanisms.

CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH each recover, on a fully reconciling basis, the costs associated with the procurement of energy, transmission related costs from FERC-approved transmission tariffs, energy efficiency programs, low income assistance programs, certain uncollectible accounts receivable for hardship customers, and restructuring and stranded costs as a result of deregulation (including securitized RRB charges), and additionally for the Massachusetts utilities, pension and PBOP benefits and net metering for distributed generation.  Energy procurement costs at NSTAR Electric include the costs related to its solar power facilities.

CL&P, NSTAR Electric, Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas each have a regulatory commission approved revenue decoupling mechanism.  Distribution revenues are decoupled from customer sales volumes, where applicable, which breaks the relationship between sales volumes and revenues.  Each company reconciles its annual base distribution rate recovery amount to the pre-established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenues.  Any difference between the allowed level of distribution revenue and the actual amount realized during a 12-month period is adjusted through rates in the following period.

Derivative Liabilities:

Regulatory assets are recorded as an offset to derivative liabilities and relate to the fair value of contracts used to purchase energy and energy-related products that will be recovered from customers in future rates.  These assets are excluded from rate base and are being recovered as the actual settlements occur over the duration of the contracts.  See Note 4, "Derivative Instruments," to the financial statements for further information on these contracts.


Goodwill-related:

The goodwill regulatory asset originated from a 1999 transaction, and the DPU allowed its recovery in NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas rates.  This regulatory asset is currently being amortized and recovered from customers in rates without a carrying charge over a


-year period, and as of

December 31, 2019

, there were


years

of amortization remaining.

Asset Retirement Obligations:

The costs associated with the depreciation of the regulated companies' ARO assets and accretion of the ARO liabilities are recorded as regulatory assets in accordance with regulatory accounting guidance.  The regulated companies' ARO assets, regulatory assets and liabilities offset and are excluded from rate base.  These costs are being recovered over the life of the underlying property, plant and equipment.

Other Regulatory Assets:

Other Regulatory Assets primarily include contractual obligations associated with the spent nuclear fuel storage costs of the CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC decommissioned nuclear power facilities, environmental remediation costs, losses associated with the reacquisition or redemption of long-term debt, certain uncollectible accounts receivable for hardship customers, certain merger-related costs allowed for recovery, water tank painting costs, and various other items.

Regulatory Costs in Long-Term Assets:

Eversource's regulated companies had

$

146.0

million

(including

$

51.8

million

for CL&P,

$

55.7

million

for NSTAR Electric and

$

18.0

million

for PSNH) and

$

122.9

million

(including

$

42.1

million

for CL&P,

$

49.3

million

for NSTAR Electric and

$

12.2

million

for PSNH) of additional regulatory costs as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, that were included in long-term assets on the balance sheets.  These amounts represent incurred costs for which recovery has not yet been specifically approved by the applicable regulatory agency.  However, based on regulatory policies or past precedent on similar costs, management believes it is probable that these costs will ultimately be approved and recovered from customers in rates.

Equity Return on Regulatory Assets:

For rate-making purposes, the regulated companies recover the carrying costs related to their regulatory assets.  For certain regulatory assets, the carrying cost recovered includes an equity return component.  This equity return, which is not recorded on the balance sheets, totaled

$

0.5

million

and

$

0.7

million

for CL&P as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, and

$

6.5

million

and

$

12.0

million

for PSNH as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.  These carrying costs will be recovered from customers in future rates.

Regulatory Liabilities:

The components of regulatory liabilities were as follows:

EDIT due to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:

Pursuant to the "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act" (the Act), which became law on December 22, 2017, Eversource had remeasured its existing deferred federal income tax balances to reflect the decrease in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent.  The remeasurement resulted in provisional regulated excess accumulated deferred income tax (excess ADIT or EDIT) liabilities that will benefit our customers in future periods and were recognized as regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet.  EDIT liabilities related to property, plant, and equipment are subject to IRS normalization rules and will be returned to customers using the same timing as the remaining useful lives of the underlying assets that gave rise to the ADIT liabilities.

Eversource's regulated companies are in the process of, or will be, refunding the EDIT liabilities to customers based on orders issued by applicable state regulatory commissions.  For CL&P (effective May 1, 2019) and Yankee Gas (effective November 15, 2018), the refund of EDIT liabilities was incorporated into base distribution rates.  For NSTAR Electric (effective January 1, 2019) and NSTAR Gas (effective February 1, 2019), the refund of EDIT liabilities occurred in rates through a new reconciling factor.  For PSNH, EDIT refunds will be addressed as part of the permanent distribution rate case filing. The EDIT balance related to PSNH's divested generation assets was included as a component of the securitization of the stranded generation assets and began to be refunded to customers, effective August 1, 2018.  For our transmission companies, on November 21, 2019, the FERC issued its final rule requiring public utilities with transmission formula rates to make adjustments to ADIT and EDIT.  Eversource expects to submit a filing demonstrating its compliance with the final rule in the second half of 2020.

Cost of Removal:

Eversource's regulated companies currently recover amounts in rates for future costs of removal of plant assets over the lives of the assets.  The estimated cost to remove utility assets from service is recognized as a component of depreciation expense, and the cumulative amount collected from customers but not yet expended is recognized as a regulatory liability.


AFUDC - Transmission:

Regulatory liabilities were recorded by CL&P and NSTAR Electric for AFUDC accrued on certain reliability-related transmission projects to reflect local rate base recovery.  These regulatory liabilities will be amortized over the depreciable life of the related transmission assets.

Revenue Subject to Refund due to Tax Cuts and Jobs Act:

Eversource established a regulatory liability with a corresponding reduction to revenue, to reflect the difference between the 35 percent federal corporate income tax rate included in rates charged to customers and the 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, until rates billed to customers reflected the lower federal tax rate.  Effective May 1, 2018, CL&P adjusted distribution rates billed to customers to reflect the lower federal income tax rate prospectively and, as of December 31, 2018, fully refunded its regulatory liability associated with the higher federal corporate income tax rate billed to customers in the period between January 1, 2018 through April 30, 2018.  Effective November 15, 2018, Yankee Gas adjusted distribution rates to reflect the lower federal income tax rate prospectively and to refund its regulatory liability associated with the higher federal corporate income tax rate billed to customers in the period between January 1, 2018 through November 14, 2018.  Effective July 1, 2019, PSNH adjusted temporary distribution rates to reflect the lower federal income tax rate prospectively and to refund its regulatory liability associated with the higher federal corporate income tax rate billed to customers in the period between January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019.  For NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas, a December 2018 DPU order indicated that the DPU would not require a revision to base distribution rates for any potential refunds associated with the higher federal corporate income tax rate billed to customers in the period between January 1, 2018 to the effective dates of each company's rate changes (effective February 1, 2018 for NSTAR Electric and July 1, 2018 for NSTAR Gas).

Effective January 1, 2018, local transmission service rates were updated to reflect the lower U.S. federal corporate income tax rate that resulted from the act.  On June 28, 2018, FERC granted a one-time tariff waiver of tariff provisions related to the federal corporate income tax rate so that effective June 1, 2018, the regional transmission service rates also reflected the reduced federal corporate income tax rate at 21 percent.

FERC ROE Complaints

:

As of

December 31, 2019

, Eversource has a reserve established for the second ROE complaint in the pending FERC ROE complaint proceedings, which was recorded as a regulatory liability and is reflected within Regulatory Tracker Mechanisms in the table above.  The cumulative pre-tax reserve (excluding interest) as of

December 31, 2019

totaled

$

39.1

million

for Eversource (including

$

21.4

million

for CL&P,

$

14.6

million

for NSTAR Electric and

$

3.1

million

for PSNH). See Note 13E, "Commitments and Contingencies – FERC ROE Complaints," for further information on developments in the pending ROE complaint proceedings.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION

Utility property, plant and equipment is recorded at original cost.  Original cost includes materials, labor, construction overheads and AFUDC for regulated property.  The cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to Operations and Maintenance expense as incurred.

The following tables summarize property, plant and equipment by asset category:


(1)

These assets are primarily comprised of computer software, hardware and equipment at Eversource Service and buildings at The Rocky River Realty Company.

In 2019, Eversource recorded an impairment charge for the NPT project costs, which had been recorded within both Construction Work in Progress and the Transmission - Electric asset categories.  For further information regarding the impairment of NPT, see Note 1D, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Impairment of Northern Pass Transmission," to the financial statements.

Depreciation of utility assets is calculated on a straight-line basis using composite rates based on the estimated remaining useful lives of the various classes of property (estimated useful life for PSNH distribution and the water utilities).  The composite rates, which are subject to approval by the appropriate state regulatory agency, include a cost of removal component, which is collected from customers over the lives of the plant assets and is recognized as a regulatory liability.  Depreciation rates are applied to property from the time it is placed in service.

Upon retirement from service, the cost of the utility asset is charged to the accumulated provision for depreciation.  The actual incurred removal costs are applied against the related regulatory liability.

The depreciation rates for the various classes of utility property, plant and equipment aggregate to composite rates as follows:

The following table summarizes average remaining useful lives of depreciable assets:

The estimated useful life of computer software, hardware and equipment primarily ranges from


to


years

and of buildings is

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

The electric and natural gas companies purchase and procure energy and energy-related products, which are subject to price volatility, for their customers.  The costs associated with supplying energy to customers are recoverable from customers in future rates.  These regulated companies manage the risks associated with the price volatility of energy and energy-related products through the use of derivative and non-derivative contracts.

Many of the derivative contracts meet the definition of, and are designated as, normal and qualify for accrual accounting under the applicable accounting guidance.  The costs and benefits of derivative contracts that meet the definition of normal are recognized in Operating Expenses on the statements of income, as applicable, as electricity or natural gas is delivered.

Derivative contracts that are not designated as normal are recorded at fair value as current or long-term Derivative Assets or Derivative Liabilities on the balance sheets.  For the electric and natural gas companies, regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities are recorded to offset the fair values of derivatives, as contract settlement amounts are recovered from, or refunded to, customers in their respective energy supply rates.


The gross fair values of derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are offset and reported as net Derivative Assets or Derivative Liabilities, with current and long-term portions, on the balance sheets.

The following table presents the gross fair values of contracts, categorized by risk type, and the net amounts recorded as current or long-term derivative assets or liabilities:

(1)

Amounts represent derivative assets and liabilities that Eversource elected to record net on the balance sheets.  These amounts are subject to master netting agreements or similar agreements for which the right of offset exists.

The business activities that result in the recognition of derivative assets also create exposure to various counterparties.  As of

December 31, 2019

, CL&P's derivative assets were exposed to counterparty credit risk and contracted with investment grade entities.

For further information on the fair value of derivative contracts, see Note 1I, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Fair Value Measurements," and Note 1J, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Derivative Accounting," to the financial statements.

Derivative Contracts at Fair Value with Offsetting Regulatory Amounts

:  As required by regulation, CL&P, along with UI, has capacity-related contracts with generation facilities.  CL&P has a sharing agreement with UI, with


percent

of the costs or benefits of each contract borne by or allocated to CL&P and


percent

borne by or allocated to UI.  The combined capacities of these contracts as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were


MW and


MW, respectively.  The capacity contracts extend through 2026 and obligate both CL&P and UI to make or receive payments on a monthly basis to or from the generation facilities based on the difference between a set capacity price and the capacity market price received in the ISO-NE capacity markets.  In addition, CL&P has a contract to purchase

0.1

million

MWh of energy per year through 2020.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, Eversource had New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) financial contracts for natural gas futures in order to reduce variability associated with the price of

9.6

million

and

12.5

million

MMBtu of natural gas, respectively.

For the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, there were losses of

$

20.7

million

,

$

25.0

million

and

$

29.0

million

, respectively, deferred as regulatory costs, which reflect the change in fair value associated with Eversource's derivative contracts.

Fair Value Measurements of Derivative Instruments

Derivative contracts classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy relate to the financial contracts for natural gas futures.  Prices are obtained from broker quotes and are based on actual market activity.  The contracts are valued using NYMEX natural gas prices.  Valuations of these contracts also incorporate discount rates using the yield curve approach.

The fair value of derivative contracts classified as Level 3 utilizes significant unobservable inputs.  The fair value is modeled using income techniques, such as discounted cash flow valuations adjusted for assumptions related to exit price.  Significant observable inputs for valuations of these contracts include energy and energy-related product prices in future years for which quoted prices in an active market exist.  Fair value measurements categorized in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy are prepared by individuals with expertise in valuation techniques, pricing of energy and energy-related products, and accounting requirements.  The future capacity prices for periods that are not quoted in an active market or established at auction are based on available market data and are escalated based on estimates of inflation in order to address the full term of the contract.

Valuations of derivative contracts using a discounted cash flow methodology include assumptions regarding the timing and likelihood of scheduled payments and also reflect non-performance risk, including credit, using the default probability approach based on the counterparty's credit rating for assets and the Company's credit rating for liabilities.  Valuations incorporate estimates of premiums or discounts that would be required by a market participant to arrive at an exit price, using historical market transactions adjusted for the terms of the contract.


The following is a summary of Level 3 derivative contracts and the range of the significant unobservable inputs utilized in the valuations over the duration of the contracts:

Exit price premiums of

2.1

percent

through

13.6

percent

are also applied to these contracts and reflect the uncertainty and illiquidity premiums that would be required based on the most recent market activity available for similar type contracts.

Significant increases or decreases in future capacity or forward reserve prices in isolation would decrease or increase, respectively, the fair value of the derivative liability.  Any increases in risk premiums would increase the fair value of the derivative liability.  Changes in these fair values are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability and do not impact net income.

Valuations using significant unobservable inputs:

The following table presents changes in the Level 3 category of derivative assets and derivative liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  The derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

Eversource holds marketable securities that are primarily used to fund certain non-qualified executive benefits.

The trusts that hold marketable securities are not subject to regulatory oversight by state or federal agencies.  CYAPC and YAEC maintain legally restricted trusts, each of which holds marketable securities, to fund the spent nuclear fuel removal obligations of their nuclear fuel storage facilities.

Equity Securities:

Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities held in Eversource's non-qualified executive benefit trust are recorded in Other Income, Net on the statements of income. The fair value of these equity securities as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $

45.7

million

and

$

44.0

million

, respectively.  For the years ended

December 31, 2019

and 2018, there were unrealized gains of

$

9.8

million

and unrealized losses of

$

4.3

million

recorded in Other Income, Net related to these equity securities, respectively.

Eversource's equity securities also include CYAPC's and YAEC's marketable securities held in spent nuclear fuel trusts, which had fair values of $

182.8

million

and

$

200.0

million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.  Unrealized gains and losses for these spent nuclear fuel trusts are subject to regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded in Marketable Securities with the corresponding offset to Other Long-Term Liabilities on the balance sheets, with no impact on the statements of income.

Available-for-Sale Debt Securities:

The following is a summary of the available-for-sale debt securities, which are recorded at fair value and are included in current and long-term Marketable Securities on the balance sheets.

Eversource's debt securities include CYAPC's and YAEC's marketable securities held in spent nuclear fuel trusts in the amounts of

$

198.1

million

and

$

143.9

million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities held in Eversource's non-qualified benefit trust are recorded in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.  There have been no significant unrealized losses, other-than-temporary impairments, or credit losses for the years ended

December 31, 2019

or


.

Factors considered in determining whether a credit loss exists include the duration and severity of the impairment, adverse conditions specifically affecting the issuer, and the payment history, ratings and rating changes of the security.  For asset-backed debt securities, underlying collateral and expected future cash flows are also evaluated.


As of

December 31, 2019

, the contractual maturities of available-for-sale debt securities were as follows:

(1)

Amounts in the Less than one year category include securities in the CYAPC and YAEC spent nuclear fuel trusts, which are restricted and are classified in long-term Marketable Securities on the balance sheets.

Realized Gains and Losses:

Realized gains and losses are recorded in Other Income, Net for Eversource's benefit trust and are offset in Other Long-Term Liabilities for CYAPC and YAEC.  Eversource utilizes the specific identification basis method for the Eversource non-qualified benefit trust, and the average cost basis method for the CYAPC and YAEC spent nuclear fuel trusts to compute the realized gains and losses on the sale of marketable securities.

Fair Value Measurements:

The following table presents the marketable securities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis by the level in which they are classified within the fair value hierarchy:

U.S. government issued debt securities are valued using market approaches that incorporate transactions for the same or similar bonds and adjustments for yields and maturity dates.  Corporate debt securities are valued using a market approach, utilizing recent trades of the same or similar instruments and also incorporating yield curves, credit spreads and specific bond terms and conditions.  Asset-backed debt securities include collateralized mortgage obligations, commercial mortgage backed securities, and securities collateralized by auto loans, credit card loans or receivables.  Asset-backed debt securities are valued using recent trades of similar instruments, prepayment assumptions, yield curves, issuance and maturity dates, and tranche information.  Municipal bonds are valued using a market approach that incorporates reported trades and benchmark yields.  Other fixed income securities are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, and discounted cash flows.

INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES

Investments in entities that are not consolidated are included in long-term assets on the balance sheets and earnings impacts from these equity investments are included in Other Income, Net on the statements of income.

Eversource's investments included the following:

For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, Eversource had equity in earnings, net of impairment, of unconsolidated affiliates of

$

42.2

million

,

$

3.8

million

, and

$

27.4

million

, respectively.  Eversource received dividends from its equity method investees of

$

48.9

million

,

$

22.3

million

and

$

20.0

million

, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.


Investments in affiliates where Eversource has the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee are initially recognized as an equity method investment at cost.  Any differences between the cost of an investment and the amount of underlying equity in net assets of an investee are considered basis differences, and are determined based upon the estimated fair values of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities.  The carrying amount of Eversource’s offshore wind investments exceeded its share of underlying equity in net assets by

$

240.3

million

and

$

7.2

million

, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.  As of December 31, 2019, these basis differences are primarily comprised of

$

168.3

million

of equity method goodwill that is not being amortized, intangible assets for PPAs, which will be amortized over the term of the PPAs, and capitalized interest.

Offshore Wind Business:

Eversource's offshore wind business includes ownership interests in North East Offshore and Bay State Wind, which together hold PPAs and contracts for the Revolution Wind, South Fork Wind and Sunrise Wind projects, as well as offshore leases through BOEM.  Eversource's offshore wind projects are being developed and constructed through a joint and equal partnership with Ørsted.  On February 8, 2019, Eversource and Ørsted entered into an equal partnership to acquire key offshore wind assets in the Northeast.  Eversource has a


percent

ownership interest in North East Offshore, which holds the Revolution Wind and South Fork Wind projects, as well as a


square-mile lease off the coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island.  Eversource also has a


percent

ownership interest in Bay State Wind, which holds the Sunrise Wind project.  Bay State Wind's separate


-square-mile ocean lease is located approximately 25 miles south of the coast of Massachusetts adjacent to the North East Offshore area.

NSTAR Electric:

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, NSTAR Electric's investments included a

14.5

percent

ownership interest in

two

companies that transmit hydro-electricity imported from the Hydro-Quebec system in Canada of

$

8.2

million

and

$

7.6

million

, respectively.

Impairment of Equity Method Investments:

Equity method investments are assessed for impairment when conditions exist that indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than book value.  If the decline in value is considered to be other-than-temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.  Impairment evaluations involve a significant degree of judgment and estimation, including identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist and developing undiscounted future cash flows.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, Eversource recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of

$

32.9

million

within Other Income, Net on our statement of income, related to Access Northeast, a natural gas pipeline and storage project, which represented the full carrying value of our equity method investment.  On April 1, 2019, pursuant to a provision in the partnership agreement jointly entered into by Eversource, Enbridge, Inc. and National Grid plc, through Algonquin Gas Transmission, LLC, the Access Northeast project was terminated.

7.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

Eversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, recognizes a liability for the fair value of an ARO on the obligation date if the liability's fair value can be reasonably estimated, even if it is conditional on a future event.  Settlement dates and future costs are reasonably estimated when sufficient information becomes available.  Management has identified various categories of AROs, primarily CYAPC's and YAEC's obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level waste, and also certain assets containing asbestos and hazardous contamination.  Management has performed fair value calculations reflecting expected probabilities for settlement scenarios.

The fair value of an ARO is recorded as a liability in Other Long-Term Liabilities with a corresponding amount included in Property, Plant and Equipment, Net on the balance sheets.  The ARO assets are depreciated, and the ARO liabilities are accreted over the estimated life of the obligation and the corresponding credits are recorded as accumulated depreciation and ARO liabilities, respectively.  As the electric and natural gas companies are rate-regulated on a cost-of-service basis, these companies apply regulatory accounting guidance and both the depreciation and accretion costs associated with these companies' AROs are recorded as increases to Regulatory Assets on the balance sheets.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending carrying amounts of ARO liabilities is as follows:

The ARO balance includes the current portion of

$

1.0

million

for Eversource and NSTAR Electric as of

December 31, 2019

, which is included in Other Current Liabilities on the balance sheets.

Eversource's amounts include CYAPC and YAEC's AROs of

$

337.7

million

and

$

339.9

million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.  The fair value of the ARO for CYAPC and YAEC includes uncertainties of the fuel off-load dates related to the DOE's timing of performance regarding its obligation to dispose of the spent nuclear fuel and high level waste and other assumptions, including discount rates.  The incremental asset recorded as an offset to the ARO liability was fully depreciated since the plants have no remaining useful life.  Any changes in the ARO liability are recorded with a corresponding offset to the related regulatory asset.  The assets held in the CYAPC and YAEC spent nuclear fuel trusts


are restricted for settling the ARO and all other nuclear fuel storage obligations.  For further information on the assets held in the spent nuclear fuel trusts, see Note 5, "Marketable Securities," to the financial statements.

The increase in the ARO balance at NSTAR Electric for the year ended December 31, 2019 was due to the recording of a new liability associated with the installation of a


kV distribution cable across Boston Harbor to Deer Island that was placed into service in 2019.  See Note 13F, "Commitments and Contingencies - Eversource and NSTAR Electric Boston Harbor Civil Action," to the financial statements for further information on the HEEC distribution cable.

SHORT-TERM DEBT

Short-Term Debt Borrowing Limits:

The amount of short-term borrowings that may be incurred by CL&P and NSTAR Electric is subject to periodic approval by the FERC.  Because the NHPUC has jurisdiction over PSNH's short-term debt, PSNH is not currently required to obtain FERC approval for its short-term borrowings.  On October 25, 2019, the FERC granted authorization that allows CL&P to issue total short-term borrowings in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed

$


million

outstanding at any one time, through December 31, 2021.  On December 18, 2019, the FERC granted authorization that allows NSTAR Electric to issue total short-term borrowings in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed

$


million

outstanding at any one time, through December 31, 2021.

PSNH is authorized by regulation of the NHPUC to incur short-term borrowings up to


percent

of net fixed plant plus an additional

$


million

until further ordered by the NHPUC.  As of

December 31, 2019

, PSNH's short-term debt authorization under the


percent

of net fixed plant test plus

$


million

totaled approximately

$


million

.

CL&P's certificate of incorporation contains preferred stock provisions restricting the amount of unsecured debt that CL&P may incur, including limiting unsecured indebtedness with a maturity of less than


years

to


percent

of total capitalization.  As of

December 31, 2019

, CL&P had

$

738.1

million

of unsecured debt capacity available under this authorization.

Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas are not required to obtain approval from any state or federal authority to incur short-term debt.

Commercial Paper Programs and Credit Agreements

:  Eversource parent has a

$

1.45

billion

commercial paper program allowing Eversource parent to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt.  Eversource parent, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut are also parties to a

five

-year

$

1.45

billion

revolving credit facility.  Effective December 9, 2019, the revolving credit facility's termination date was extended for one additional year to December 6, 2024.  The revolving credit facility serves to backstop Eversource parent's

$

1.45

billion

commercial paper program.

NSTAR Electric has a

$


million

commercial paper program allowing NSTAR Electric to issue commercial paper as a form of short-term debt.  NSTAR Electric is also a party to a

five

-year

$


million

revolving credit facility.  Effective December 9, 2019, the revolving credit facility's termination date was extended for one additional year to December 6, 2024.  The revolving credit facility serves to backstop NSTAR Electric's

$


million

commercial paper program.

The amount of borrowings outstanding and available under the commercial paper programs were as follows:

There were

no

borrowings outstanding on either the Eversource parent or NSTAR Electric revolving credit facilities as of

December 31, 2019

or


.

Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper programs and revolving credit facilities are included in Notes Payable and classified in current liabilities on the Eversource and NSTAR Electric balance sheets as all borrowings are outstanding for no more than 364 days at one time.  As a result of the Eversource parent long-term debt issuance on January 10, 2020, the net proceeds of which were used to repay short-term borrowings outstanding under its commercial paper program,

$

346.3

million

of commercial paper borrowings under the Eversource parent commercial paper program were classified as Long-Term Debt as of December 31, 2019.

Under the credit facilities described above, Eversource and its subsidiaries must comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including a consolidated debt to total capitalization ratio.  As of

December 31, 2019

and


, Eversource and its subsidiaries were in compliance with these covenants.  If Eversource or its subsidiaries were not in compliance with these covenants, an event of default would occur requiring all outstanding borrowings by such borrower to be repaid, and additional borrowings by such borrower would not be permitted under its respective credit facility.

The Company expects the future operating cash flows of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, along with existing borrowing availability and access to both debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to meet any working capital and future operating requirements, and capital investment forecasted opportunities.


Intercompany Borrowings:

Eversource parent uses its available capital resources to provide loans to its subsidiaries to assist in meeting their short-term borrowing needs.  Eversource parent records intercompany interest income from its loans to subsidiaries, which is eliminated in consolidation.  Intercompany loans from Eversource parent to its subsidiaries are eliminated in consolidation on Eversource's balance sheets.  As of

December 31, 2019

, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to CL&P of $

63.8

million

, to PSNH of

$

27.0

million

, and to a subsidiary of NSTAR Electric of

$

30.3

million

. As of December 31,


, there were intercompany loans from Eversource parent to PSNH of $

57.0

million

.  Intercompany loans from Eversource parent are included in Notes Payable to Eversource Parent and classified in current liabilities on the respective subsidiary's balance sheets.

million

of long-term debt.  On January 27, 2020, the DPU approved NSTAR Gas' request for authorization to issue up to

$


million

in long-term debt through December 31, 2021.

Long-Term Debt Provisions:

The utility plant of CL&P, PSNH, Yankee Gas, NSTAR Gas and a portion of Aquarion is subject to the lien of each company's respective first mortgage bond indenture.  The Eversource parent, NSTAR Electric and a portion of Aquarion debt is unsecured.  Additionally, the long-term debt agreements provide that Eversource and certain of its subsidiaries must comply with certain covenants as are customarily included in such agreements, including equity requirements for NSTAR Electric, NSTAR Gas and Aquarion.  Under the equity requirements, NSTAR Electric's and Aquarion's senior notes must maintain a certain consolidated indebtedness to capitalization ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter and NSTAR Gas' outstanding long-term debt must not exceed equity.

CL&P's obligation to repay the Pollution Control Revenue Bonds (PCRBs) is secured by first mortgage bonds.  The first mortgage bonds contain similar terms and provisions as the applicable series of PCRBs.  If CL&P fails to meet its obligations under the first mortgage bonds, then the holder of the first mortgage bonds (the issuer of the PCRBs) would have rights under the first mortgage bonds.  CL&P's tax-exempt PCRBs will be subject to redemption at par on or after September 1, 2021.

Certain secured and unsecured long-term debt securities are callable at redemption price or are subject to make-whole provisions.

Eversource, NSTAR Electric, Yankee Gas and Aquarion have certain long-term debt agreements that contain cross-default provisions.  No other debt issuances contain cross-default provisions as of

December 31, 2019

.


CYAPC's Pre-1983 Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligation:

Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, the DOE is responsible for the selection and development of repositories for, and the disposal of, spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste.  CYAPC is obligated to pay the DOE for the costs to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste generated prior to April 7, 1983 (pre-1983 Spent Nuclear Fuel) and recorded an accrual for the full liability thereof to the DOE.  This liability accrues interest costs at the 3-month Treasury bill yield rate.  For nuclear fuel used to generate electricity prior to April 7, 1983, payment may be made any time prior to the first delivery of spent fuel to the DOE.  Fees for disposal of nuclear fuel burned on or after April 7, 1983 were billed to member companies and paid to the DOE.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, as a result of consolidating CYAPC, Eversource has consolidated

$

11.6

million

and

$

39.5

million

, respectively, in pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligations to the DOE.  In December 2019 and 2018, CYAPC paid

$


million

and

$


million

, respectively, to the DOE to partially settle this obligation.  The obligation includes accumulated interest costs of

$

8.6

million

and

$

29.0

million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.  CYAPC maintains a trust to fund amounts due to the DOE for the disposal of pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel.  For further information, see Note 5, "Marketable Securities," to the financial statements.

Long-Term Debt Maturities:

Long-term debt maturities on debt outstanding for the years 2020 through 2024 and thereafter are shown below.

RATE REDUCTION BONDS AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

Rate Reduction Bonds:

On May 8, 2018, PSNH Funding, a wholly-owned subsidiary of PSNH, issued

$

635.7

million

of securitized RRBs in multiple tranches with a weighted average interest rate of

3.66

percent

, and final maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2035.  The RRBs are expected to be repaid by February 1, 2033.  RRB payments consist of principal and interest and are paid semi-annually, beginning on February 1, 2019. The RRBs were issued pursuant to a finance order

issued by the NHPUC on January 30, 2018 to recover remaining costs resulting from the divestiture of PSNH’s generation assets.

The proceeds were used by PSNH Funding to purchase PSNH’s stranded cost asset-recovery property, including its vested property right to bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable stranded cost recovery charge from PSNH’s retail customers.  The collections are used to pay principal, interest and other costs in connection with the RRBs.  The RRBs are secured by the stranded cost asset-recovery property.  Cash collections from the stranded cost recovery charges and funds on deposit in trust accounts are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation.  PSNH is not the owner of the RRBs, and PSNH Funding’s assets and revenues are not available to pay PSNH’s creditors.  The RRBs are non-recourse senior secured obligations of PSNH Funding and are not insured or guaranteed by PSNH or Eversource Energy.

PSNH Funding was formed solely to issue RRBs to finance PSNH’s unrecovered remaining costs associated with the divestiture of its generation assets.  PSNH Funding is considered a VIE primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations.  PSNH has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE and is most closely associated with the VIE as compared to other interest holders.  Therefore, PSNH is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates PSNH Funding in its consolidated financial statements.

The following tables summarize the impact of PSNH Funding on PSNH's balance sheets and income statements:

Variable Interest Entities - Other:

The Company's variable interests outside of the consolidated group include contracts that are required by regulation and provide for regulatory recovery of contract costs and benefits through customer rates.  Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric hold variable interests in VIEs through agreements with certain entities that own single renewable energy or peaking generation power plants, with other independent power producers and with transmission businesses.  Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric do not control the activities that are economically significant to these VIEs or provide financial or other support to these VIEs.  Therefore, Eversource, CL&P and NSTAR Electric do not consolidate these VIEs.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

A.     Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension

Eversource provides defined benefit retirement plans (Pension Plans) that cover eligible employees and are subject to the provisions of ERISA, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Eversource's policy is to annually fund the Pension Plans in an amount at least equal to an amount that will satisfy all federal funding requirements.  In addition to the Pension Plans, Eversource maintains non-qualified defined benefit retirement plans (SERP Plans) which provide benefits in excess of Internal Revenue Code limitations to eligible participants consisting of current and retired employees.

Eversource also provides defined benefit postretirement plans (PBOP Plans) that provide life insurance and a health reimbursement arrangement created for the purpose of reimbursing retirees and dependents for health insurance premiums and certain medical expenses to eligible employees that meet certain age and service eligibility requirements.  The benefits provided under the PBOP Plans are not vested, and the Company has the right to modify any benefit provision subject to applicable laws at that time.  Eversource annually funds postretirement costs through tax deductible contributions to external trusts.

The Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans cover eligible employees, including, among others, employees of the regulated companies.  Because the regulated companies recover retiree benefit costs from customers through rates, regulatory assets are recorded in lieu of recording an adjustment to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) as an offset to the funded status of the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans.  Regulatory accounting is also applied to the portions of the Eversource Service retiree benefit costs that support the regulated companies, as these costs are also recovered from customers.  Adjustments to the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans' funded status for the unregulated companies are recorded on an after-tax basis to Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss).  For further information, see Note 2, "Regulatory Accounting," and Note 17, "Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss)," to the financial statements.

Funded Status:

The Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans are accounted for under the multiple-employer approach, with each operating company's balance sheet reflecting its share of the funded status of the plans.  Although Eversource maintains marketable securities in a benefit trust, the SERP Plans do not contain any assets.  For further information, see Note 5, "Marketable Securities," to the financial statements.

The following tables provide information on the plan benefit obligations, fair values of plan assets, and funded status:

As of

December 31, 2019

, there was a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the pension funded status, which resulted in an increase to Eversource's pension liability of

$

813.1

million

, which was partially offset by changes in actual plan experience and changes in other assumptions.


As of December 31, 2018, there was an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the pension funded status, which resulted in a decrease to Eversource's pension liability of approximately

$


million

, which was partially offset by changes in actual plan experience and changes in other assumptions.

The pension and SERP Plans' funded status includes the current portion of the SERP liability totaling

$

8.7

million

and

$

8.9

million

as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively, which is included in Other Current Liabilities on the balance sheets.

As of

December 31, 2019

and


, the accumulated benefit obligation for the Pension and SERP Plans is as follows:

The Eversource PBOP funded status includes prepaid assets of

$

62.7

million

and

$

33.4

million

recorded in Other Long-Term Assets and liabilities of

$

25.8

million

and

$

25.3

million

included in Accrued Pension, SERP and PBOP on the balance sheets as of

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

As of

December 31, 2019

, there was a decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the PBOP funded status, which resulted in an increase to the Eversource PBOP liability of

$

88.6

million

.  As of December 31, 2018, there was an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the funded status, which resulted in a decrease to the Eversource PBOP liability of approximately

$


million

.

The following actuarial assumptions were used in calculating the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans' year end funded status:

For the Eversource Service PBOP Plan, the health care cost trend rate is not applicable.  For the Aquarion PBOP Plan, the health care trend rate is a range of

3.5

percent

to

6.5

percent

, with an ultimate rate of

3.5

percent

to


percent

in 2019 and 2023, for post-65 and pre-65 retirees, respectively.


Expense:

Eversource charges net periodic benefit expense/(income) for the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans to its subsidiaries based on the actual participant demographic data for each subsidiary's participants.  The actual investment return in the trust is allocated to each of the subsidiaries annually in proportion to the investment return expected to be earned during the year.  The Company utilizes the spot rate methodology to estimate the discount rate for the service and interest cost components of benefit expense, which provides a more precise measurement by matching projected cash flows to the corresponding spot rates on the yield curve.

The components of net periodic benefit expense/(income) for the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans, prior to amounts capitalized as Property, Plant and Equipment or deferred as regulatory assets for future recovery, are shown below.  The service cost component of net periodic benefit expense/(income), less the capitalized portion, is included in Operations and Maintenance expense on the statements of income.  The remaining components of net periodic benefit expense/(income), less the deferred portion, are included in

Other Income, Net

on the statements of income.  Pension, SERP and PBOP expense reflected in the statements of cash flows for CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH does not include the intercompany allocations or the corresponding capitalized and deferred portion, as these amounts are cash settled on a short-term basis.

The following actuarial assumptions were used to calculate Pension, SERP and PBOP expense amounts:

For the Aquarion Pension and PBOP Plans, the expected long-term rate of return was


percent

for the years ended

December 31, 2019

and 2018.  For the Aquarion PBOP Plan, the health care trend rate was a range of

3.5

percent

to

6.75

percent

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, and


percent

for the year ended December 31, 2018.


The following is a summary of the changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Regulatory Assets and Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) as well as amounts in Regulatory Assets and OCI that were reclassified as net periodic benefit expense during the years presented:

(1)

These amounts were reclassified to securitized regulatory assets in connection with the divestiture of PSNH's generation business. For further information see Note 2, "Regulatory Accounting" to the financial statements.

The following is a summary of the remaining Regulatory Assets and Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income amounts that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit expense as of

December 31, 2019

and


, as well as the amounts that are expected to be recognized as components in


:

The difference between the actual return and calculated expected return on plan assets for the Pension and PBOP Plans is reflected as a component of unamortized actuarial gains or losses, which are recorded in Regulatory Assets or Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss). Unamortized actuarial gains or losses are amortized as a component of pension and PBOP expense over the estimated average future employee service period.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments:

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, are expected to be paid by the Pension, SERP and PBOP Plans:

Eversource Contributions:

Based on the current status of the Pension Plans and federal pension funding requirements, Eversource currently expects to make contributions of

$

105.0

million

in


, of which

$

23.2

million

and

$

19.5

million

will be contributed by CL&P and PSNH, respectively.  The remaining

$

57.3

million

is expected to be contributed by other Eversource subsidiaries, primarily Eversource Service.  Eversource currently estimates contributing

$

2.9

million

to the PBOP Plans in


.

Fair Value of Pension and PBOP Plan Assets:

Pension and PBOP funds are held in external trusts.  Trust assets, including accumulated earnings, must be used exclusively for Pension and PBOP payments.  Eversource's investment strategy for its Pension and PBOP Plans is to maximize the long-term rates of return on these plans' assets within an acceptable level of risk.  The investment strategy for each asset category includes a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers and it establishes target asset allocations that are routinely reviewed and periodically rebalanced.  PBOP assets are comprised of assets held in the PBOP Plan trust, as well as specific assets within the Pension Plan trust (401(h) assets).  The investment policy and strategy of the 401(h) assets is consistent with that of the defined benefit pension plan.  Eversource's expected long-term rates of return on Pension and PBOP Plan assets are based on target asset allocation assumptions and related expected long-term rates of return.  In developing its expected long-term rate of return assumptions for the Pension and PBOP Plans, Eversource evaluated input from consultants, as well as long-term inflation assumptions and historical returns. Management has assumed long-term rates of return of

8.25

percent

for the Eversource Service Pension and PBOP Plan assets and a


percent

long-term rate of return for the Aquarion Plans to estimate its


Pension and PBOP costs.


These long-term rates of return are based on the assumed rates of return for the target asset allocations as follows:

The taxable assets within the Eversource PBOP Plan have a target asset allocation of


percent

equity securities and


percent

fixed income securities.  The target asset allocation for the Aquarion Pension Plan is


percent

equity,


percent

debt and


percent

other.  The target asset allocation for the Aquarion PBOP Plan is


percent

equity,


percent

debt and


percent

other.

The following table presents, by asset category, the Pension and PBOP Plan assets recorded at fair value on a recurring basis by the level in which they are classified within the fair value hierarchy:

(1)

United States, Global, Non-United States and Emerging Markets equity securities that are uncategorized include investments in commingled funds and hedge funds that are overlaid with equity index swaps and futures contracts.

(2)

Fixed Income investments that are uncategorized include investments in commingled funds, fixed income funds that invest in a variety of opportunistic and fixed income strategies, and hedge funds that are overlaid with fixed income futures.

(3)

Real assets include real estate funds and hedge funds.

(4)

The assets of the Pension Plan include a 401(h) account that has been allocated to provide health and welfare postretirement benefits under the PBOP Plan.


The Company values assets based on observable inputs when available.  Equity securities, exchange traded funds and futures contracts classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy are priced based on the closing price on the primary exchange as of the balance sheet date.

Fixed income securities, such as government issued securities and corporate bonds, are included in Level 2 and are valued using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows.  The pricing models utilize observable inputs such as recent trades for the same or similar instruments, yield curves, discount margins and bond structures.  Swaps are valued using pricing models that incorporate interest rates and equity and fixed income index closing prices to determine a net present value of the cash flows.

Certain investments, such as commingled funds, private equity investments, real estate funds and hedge funds are valued using the net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient.  These investments are structured as investment companies offering shares or units to multiple investors for the purpose of providing a return.  Commingled funds are recorded at NAV provided by the asset manager, which is based on the market prices of the underlying equity securities.  Private Equity investments, Fixed Income partnership funds and Real Assets are valued using the NAV provided by the partnerships, which are based on discounted cash flows of the underlying investments, real estate appraisals or public market comparables of the underlying investments, or the NAV of underlying assets held in hedge funds.  Assets valued at NAV are uncategorized in the fair value hierarchy.

B.

Defined Contribution Plans

Eversource maintains defined contribution plans on behalf of eligible participants.  The Eversource 401k Plan provides for employee and employer contributions up to statutory limits.  For eligible employees, the Eversource 401k Plan provides employer matching contributions of either


percent

up to a maximum of

three

percent of eligible compensation or


percent

up to a maximum of

eight

percent of eligible compensation.  The Eversource 401k Plan also contains a K-Vantage feature for the benefit of eligible participants, which provides an additional annual employer contribution based on age and years of service.  K-Vantage participants are not eligible to actively participate in the Eversource Pension Plan.

The total Eversource 401k Plan employer matching contributions, including the K-Vantage contributions, were as follows:

C.

Share-Based Payments

Share-based compensation awards are recorded using a fair-value based method at the date of grant.  Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH record compensation expense related to these awards, as applicable, for shares issued or sold to their respective employees and officers, as well as for the allocation of costs associated with shares issued or sold to Eversource's service company employees and officers that support CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.

Eversource Incentive Plans:

Eversource maintains long-term equity-based incentive plans in which Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH employees, officers and board members are eligible to participate.  The incentive plans authorize Eversource to grant up to

6,700,000

new shares for various types of awards, including RSUs and performance shares, to eligible employees, officers, and board members.  As of

December 31, 2019

and


, Eversource had

3,302,526

and

3,720,650

common shares, respectively, available for issuance under these plans.

Eversource accounts for its various share-based plans as follows:

•

RSUs - Eversource records compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period based upon the fair value of Eversource's common shares at the date of grant.  The par value of RSUs is reclassified to Common Stock from Capital Surplus, Paid In as RSUs become issued as common shares.

•

Performance Shares - Eversource records compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.  Performance shares vest based upon the extent to which Company goals are achieved.  Vesting of outstanding performance shares is based upon both the Company's EPS growth over the requisite service period and the total shareholder return as compared to the Edison Electric Institute (EEI) Index during the requisite service period.  The fair value of performance shares is determined at the date of grant using a lattice model.

RSUs:

Eversource granted RSUs under the annual long-term incentive programs that are subject to

three

-year graded vesting schedules for employees, and

one

-year graded vesting schedules, or immediate vesting, for board members.  RSUs are paid in shares, reduced by amounts sufficient to satisfy withholdings for income taxes, subsequent to vesting.

A summary of RSU transactions is as follows:


The weighted average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


was

$

67.91

,

$

56.69

and

$

55.97

and


, the number and weighted average grant-date fair value of unvested RSUs was

439,293

and

$

63.06

per share, and

424,119

and

$

56.57

per share, respectively.  During


, there were

236,359

RSUs at a weighted average grant-date fair value of

$

57.47

per share that vested during the year and were either paid or deferred.  As of

December 31, 2019

,

334,870

RSUs were fully vested and deferred and an additional

417,328

are expected to vest.

Performance Shares:

Eversource granted performance shares under the annual long-term incentive programs that vest based upon the extent to which Company goals are achieved at the end of three-year performance measurement periods.  Performance shares are paid in shares, after the performance measurement period.

A summary of performance share transactions is as follows:

The weighted average grant-date fair value of performance shares granted for the years ended

December 31, 2019

performance shares at a weighted average grant-date fair value of

$

58.13

per share that vested during the year and were either paid or deferred.  As of

December 31, 2019

,

59,013

performance shares were fully vested and deferred.

Compensation Expense:

The total compensation expense and associated future income tax benefits recognized by Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for share-based compensation awards were as follows:

As of

December 31, 2019

, there was

$

24.4

million

of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested share-based awards for Eversource, including

$

5.3

million

for CL&P,

$

5.3

million

for NSTAR Electric and

$

2.1

million

for PSNH.  This cost is expected to be recognized ratably over a weighted-average period of

1.75

years for Eversource,

1.79

years for CL&P and NSTAR Electric, and

1.78

years for PSNH.

An income tax rate of


percent

was used to estimate the tax effect on total share-based payments determined under the fair-value based method for all awards.  Beginning in 2019, the Company began issuing treasury shares to settle fully vested RSUs and performance shares under the Company's incentive plans.

For the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, excess tax benefits associated with the distribution of stock compensation awards reduced income tax expense by

$

1.5

million

,

$

1.5

million

, and

$

2.9

million

, respectively, which increased cash flows from operating activities on the statements of cash flows.

D.

Other Retirement Benefits

Eversource provides retirement and other benefits for certain current and past company officers.  These benefits are accounted for on an accrual basis and expensed over a period equal to the service lives of the employees.  The actuarially-determined liability for these benefits is included in Other Current and Long-Term Liabilities on the balance sheets.  The related expense, which includes the allocation of expense associated with Eversource's service company officers that support CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, is included in Operations and Maintenance Expense on the income statements.

The liability and expense amounts are as follows:


12.

INCOME TAXES

The components of income tax expense are as follows:

A reconciliation between income tax expense and the expected tax expense at the statutory rate is as follows:


Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH file a consolidated federal income tax return and unitary, combined and separate state income tax returns.  These entities are also parties to a tax allocation agreement under which taxable subsidiaries do not pay any more taxes than they would have otherwise paid had they filed a separate company tax return, and subsidiaries generating tax losses, if any, are paid for their losses when utilized.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities.  The tax effect of temporary differences is accounted for in accordance with the rate-making treatment of the applicable regulatory commissions and relevant accounting authoritative literature.

The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to the net accumulated deferred income tax obligations are as follows:


2017 Federal Legislation:

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act became law, which amended existing federal tax rules and included numerous provisions that impacted corporations.  In particular, the act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent effective January 1, 2018.  For our regulated companies, the most significant changes are (1) the benefit of incurring a lower federal income tax expense and (2) the reduction in ADIT liabilities (now excess ADIT or EDIT), which are estimated to be approximately

$

2.8

billion

and are included in regulatory liabilities as of

December 31, 2019

.  In 2019, Eversource refunded

$

51.5

million

(

$

7.9

million

at CL&P,

$

31.5

million

at NSTAR Electric,

$

5.6

million

at PSNH,

$

1.4

million

at Yankee Gas and

$

5.1

million

at NSTAR Gas) to customers.  See Note 2, "Regulatory Accounting," to the financial statements for further information.

2019 Federal Legislation:

On December 20, 2019, the "Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020," became law, which provided a one-year extension of the production tax credit or the investment tax credit for renewable wind projects under Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 on which construction begins before January 1, 2021.  If construction begins on a qualifying wind project in 2020, the project will qualify for a production tax credit of $15 per MWh or an 18 percent investment tax credit.

Carryforwards:

The following table provides the amounts and expiration dates of state tax credit and loss carryforwards and federal tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards:

In 2019,

the company increased its valuation allowance reserve for state credits by

$

18.5

million

(

$

14.2

million

for CL&P), net of tax, to reflect an update for expired tax credits.

In 2018,

the Company increased its valuation allowance reserve for state

credits by

$

5.2

million

(

$

4.4

million

for CL&P), net of tax, to reflect an update for expired tax credits.

For 2019 and 2018, state credit and state loss carryforwards have been partially reserved by a valuation allowance of

$

43.0

million

and

$

19.5

million

(net of tax), respectively.

Unrecognized Tax Benefits:

A reconciliation of the activity in unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would impact the effective tax rate if recognized, is as follows:

Interest and Penalties:

Interest on uncertain tax positions is recorded and generally classified as a component of Other Interest Expense on the statements of income.  However, when resolution of uncertainties results in the Company receiving interest income, any related interest benefit is recorded in Other Income, Net on the statements of income.  No penalties have been recorded.

The amount of interest expense/(income) on uncertain tax positions recognized and the related accrued interest payable/(receivable) are as follows:


Tax Positions:

During 2019 and 2018, Eversource did not resolve any of its uncertain tax positions.

Open Tax Years:

The following table summarizes Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH's tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of December 31,


:

Eversource does not estimate to have an earnings impact related to unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

A.     Environmental Matters

Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are subject to environmental laws and regulations intended to mitigate or remove the effect of past operations and improve or maintain the quality of the environment.  These laws and regulations require the removal or the remedy of the effect on the environment of the disposal or release of certain specified hazardous substances at current and former operating sites.  Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH have an active environmental auditing and training program and each believes it is substantially in compliance with all enacted laws and regulations.

Environmental reserves are accrued when assessments indicate it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated.  The approach used estimates the liability based on the most likely action plan from a variety of available remediation options, including no action required or several different remedies ranging from establishing institutional controls to full site remediation and monitoring.  These liabilities are estimated on an undiscounted basis and do not assume that the amounts are recoverable from insurance companies or other third parties.  The environmental reserves include sites at different stages of discovery and remediation and do not include any unasserted claims.

These reserve estimates are subjective in nature as they take into consideration several different remediation options at each specific site.  The reliability and precision of these estimates can be affected by several factors, including new information concerning either the level of contamination at the site, the extent of Eversource's, CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's and PSNH's responsibility for remediation or the extent of remediation required, recently enacted laws and regulations or changes in cost estimates due to certain economic factors.  It is possible that new information or future developments could require a reassessment of the potential exposure to required environmental remediation.  As this information becomes available, management will continue to assess the potential exposure and adjust the reserves accordingly.

The amounts recorded as environmental reserves are included in Other Current Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities on the balance sheets and represent management's best estimate of the liability for environmental costs, and take into consideration site assessment, remediation and long-term monitoring costs.  The environmental reserves also take into account recurring costs of managing hazardous substances and pollutants, mandated expenditures to remediate contaminated sites and any other infrequent and non-recurring clean-up costs.

A reconciliation of the activity in the environmental reserves is as follows:

The number of environmental sites for which remediation or long-term monitoring, preliminary site work or site assessment is being performed are as follows:

The increase in the reserve balance was due primarily to changes in cost estimates at certain MGP sites at the natural gas companies, at CL&P and at PSNH, for which additional remediation will be required.


Included in the number of sites and reserve amounts above are former MGP sites that were operated several decades ago and manufactured natural gas from coal and other processes, which resulted in certain by-products remaining in the environment that may pose a potential risk to human health and the environment, for which Eversource may have potential liability.  The reserve balances related to these former MGP sites were

$

67.9

million

and

$

50.1

million

as of

December 31, 2019

and 2018, respectively, and related primarily to the natural gas business segment.

As of

December 31, 2019

, for


environmental sites (


for CL&P) that are included in the Company's reserve for environmental costs, the information known and the nature of the remediation options allow for the Company to estimate the range of losses for environmental costs.  As of

December 31, 2019

,

$

35.9

million

(including

$

0.4

million

for CL&P) had been accrued as a liability for these sites, which represents the low end of the range of the liabilities for environmental costs.  Management believes that additional losses of up to approximately

$


million

(

$

0.5

million

at CL&P) may be incurred in executing current remediation plans for these sites.

As of

December 31, 2019

, for


environmental sites (


for CL&P and


for NSTAR Electric) that are included in the Company's reserve for environmental costs, management cannot reasonably estimate the exposure to loss in excess of the reserve, or range of loss, as these sites are under investigation and/or there is significant uncertainty as to what remedial actions, if any, the Company may be required to undertake.  As of

December 31, 2019

,

$

7.4

million

(including

$

2.3

million

for CL&P and

$

1.9

million

for NSTAR Electric) had been accrued as a liability for these sites.  As of

December 31, 2019

, for the remaining


environmental sites (including


for CL&P,


for NSTAR Electric and


for PSNH) that are included in the Company's reserve for environmental costs, the

$

37.7

million

accrual (including

$

8.7

million

for CL&P,

$

6.1

million

for NSTAR Electric and

$

7.5

million

for PSNH) represents management's best estimate of the probable liability and no additional loss is anticipated at this time.

PSNH, NSTAR Gas and Yankee Gas have rate recovery mechanisms for MGP related environmental costs, therefore, changes in their respective environmental reserves do not impact Net Income.  CL&P is allowed to defer certain environmental costs for future recovery.  NSTAR Electric does not have a separate environmental cost recovery regulatory mechanism.

B.

Long-Term Contractual Arrangements

Estimated Future Annual Costs:

The estimated future annual costs of significant executed, non-cancelable, long-term contractual arrangements in effect as of

December 31, 2019

are as follows:

Renewable Energy:

Renewable energy contracts include non-cancellable commitments under contracts of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH for the purchase of energy and capacity from renewable energy facilities.  Such contracts extend through 2039 for CL&P, 2040 for NSTAR Electric and 2033 for PSNH.


On

December 28, 2018

, under Public Act 17-3, "An Act Concerning Zero Carbon Procurement," DEEP selected the Millstone Nuclear Power Station generation facility and Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant, along with smaller generation facilities, in DEEP’s zero-carbon request for proposal.  CL&P and UI were directed by DEEP to enter into

ten

-year contracts to purchase a combined total of approximately


million

MWh annually from the Millstone generation facility.  On

March 15, 2019

, CL&P and UI each signed a

ten

-year contract with the owner of Millstone Nuclear Power Station in order to purchase a combined amount of approximately


percent

of the facility's output (approximately


percent

by CL&P).  The Millstone Nuclear Power Station has a

2,112

MW nameplate capacity.  PURA approved the contracts on September 18, 2019.  Energy deliveries and payments under these contracts began in the fourth quarter of 2019.

CL&P and UI were also directed by DEEP to enter into

eight

-year contracts to purchase a combined amount of approximately


percent

of the facility's output (approximately


percent

by CL&P), from the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant beginning January 1, 2022.  The Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant has an approximate

1,250

MW nameplate capacity.  On

November 22, 2019

, CL&P and UI each signed an

eight

-year contract with the owner of the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant.  PURA approved the contracts on November 27, 2019.

The total estimated cost of the Millstone Nuclear Power Station and Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant energy purchase contracts are

$

4.1

billion

and are reflected in the table above.  CL&P sells the energy purchased under these contracts into the market and uses the proceeds from these energy sales to offset the contract costs.  As the net costs under these contracts are recovered from customers in future rates, the contracts do not have an impact on the net income of CL&P.   These new contracts do not meet the definition of a derivative, and accordingly, the costs of these contracts are being accounted for as incurred.

The contractual obligations table above does not include long-term commitments signed by CL&P and NSTAR Electric, as required by the PURA and DPU, respectively, for the purchase of renewable energy and related products that are contingent on the future construction of energy facilities.

Purchased Power and Capacity:

These contracts include capacity CfDs of CL&P through 2026, and various IPP contracts or purchase obligations for electricity which extend through 2024 for CL&P, 2031 for NSTAR Electric and 2023 for PSNH.

CL&P, along with UI, has

three

capacity CfDs for a total of approximately


MW of capacity consisting of

two

generation units and

one

demand response project.  The capacity CfDs extend through 2026 and obligate both CL&P and UI to make or receive payments on a monthly basis to or from the generation facilities based on the difference between a set contractual capacity price and the capacity market prices received by the generation facilities in the ISO-NE capacity markets.  CL&P has a sharing agreement with UI, whereby UI shares


percent of the costs and benefits of these contracts.  CL&P's portion of the costs and benefits of these contracts will be paid by, or refunded to, CL&P's customers.

The contractual obligations table above does not include CL&P's, NSTAR Electric's or PSNH's standard/basic service contracts for the purchase of energy supply, the amounts of which vary with customers' energy needs.

Peaker CfDs:

CL&P, along with UI, has

three

peaker CfDs for a total of approximately


MW of peaking capacity through 2042.  CL&P has a sharing agreement with UI, whereby CL&P is responsible for


percent and UI for


percent of the net costs or benefits of these CfDs.  The Peaker CfDs pay the generation facility owner the difference between capacity, forward reserve and energy market revenues and a cost-of-service payment stream for


years.  The ultimate cost or benefit to CL&P under these contracts will depend on the costs of plant operation and the prices that the projects receive for capacity and other products in the ISO-NE markets.  CL&P's portion of the amounts paid or received under the Peaker CfDs will be recoverable from, or refunded to, CL&P's customers.

Natural Gas Procurement:

Eversource's natural gas distribution businesses have long-term contracts for the purchase, transportation and storage of natural gas as part of its portfolio of supplies, which extend through 2038.

Transmission Support Commitments:

Along with other New England utilities, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH entered into agreements in 1985 to support transmission and terminal facilities that were built to import electricity from the Hydro-Québec system in Canada.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are obligated to pay, over a


-year period ending in 2020, their proportionate shares of the annual operation and maintenance expenses and capital costs of those facilities.  Future transmission support agreements beginning in the second half of 2020 are under negotiation.

The total costs incurred under these agreements were as follows:


(1)

PSNH previously entered into various arrangements for the purchase of coal, wood and the transportation services for fuel supply for its electric generating assets.  In 2018, Eversource and PSNH completed the sales of PSNH's thermal and hydroelectric generation assets.  Upon sale, the remaining future contractual obligations were transferred to the respective buyers.  See Note 14, "Generation Asset Sale," for further information.

C.

Spent Nuclear Fuel Obligations - Yankee Companies

CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH have plant closure and fuel storage cost obligations to the Yankee Companies, which have each completed the physical decommissioning of their respective nuclear power facilities and are now engaged in the long-term storage of their spent fuel.  The Yankee Companies fund these costs through litigation proceeds received from the DOE and, to the extent necessary, through wholesale, FERC-approved rates charged under power purchase agreements with several New England utilities, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, in turn recover these costs from their customers through state regulatory commission-approved retail rates.  The Yankee Companies collect amounts that management believes are adequate to recover the remaining plant closure and fuel storage cost estimates for the respective plants.  Management believes CL&P and NSTAR Electric will recover their shares of these obligations from their customers.  PSNH has recovered its total share of these costs from its customers.

Spent Nuclear Fuel Litigation:

The Yankee Companies have filed complaints against the DOE in the Court of Federal Claims seeking monetary damages resulting from the DOE's failure to accept delivery of, and provide for a permanent facility to store, spent nuclear fuel pursuant to the terms of the 1983 spent fuel and high-level waste disposal contracts between the Yankee Companies and the DOE. The court previously awarded the Yankee Companies damages for Phases I, II and III of litigation resulting from the DOE's failure to meet its contractual obligations.  These Phases covered damages incurred in the years 1998 through 2012, and the awarded damages have been received by the Yankee Companies with certain amounts of the damages refunded to their customers.

DOE Phase IV Damages -

On May 22, 2017, each of the Yankee Companies filed a fourth set of lawsuits against the DOE in the Court of Federal

Claims.  The Yankee Companies sought monetary damages totaling

$

104.4

million

for CYAPC, YAEC and MYAPC, resulting from the DOE's failure to begin accepting spent nuclear fuel for disposal covering the years from 2013 to 2016 (“DOE Phase IV”).  On February 21, 2019, the Yankee Companies received a partial summary judgment and partial final judgment in their favor for the undisputed amount of monetary damages of

$

103.2

million

.  The court awarded CYAPC, YAEC, and MYAPC damages of

$

40.7

million

,

$

28.1

million

and

$

34.4

million

, respectively.  The DOE did not appeal the court's judgment and the decision became final on April 23, 2019.  On June 12, 2019, each of the Yankee Companies received the damages proceeds.  On June 12, 2019, the court accepted an offer of judgment in the amount of

$

0.5

million

to settle the disputed amount of approximately

$


million

in Phase IV contested damages.  The Yankee Companies received the

$

0.5

million

payment in July 2019.  CYAPC's and YAEC's proceeds received were classified as operating activities on the Eversource consolidated statement of cash flows.

In September 2019, the Yankee Companies made a required informational filing with FERC as to the use of proceeds, for which approval was received in the fourth quarter of 2019.  In December 2019, YAEC and MYAPC returned proceeds of

$

5.4

million

and

$

21.0

million

, respectively, to its member companies, of which the Eversource utilities (CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH) received a total of

$

2.8

million

from YAEC and

$

5.0

million

from MYAPC.  The Eversource utilities will ultimately refund these proceeds to utility customers.  Also, in December 2019, CYAPC paid

$

29.0

million

to the DOE to partially settle its pre-1983 spent nuclear fuel obligation.

D.

Guarantees and Indemnifications

In the normal course of business, Eversource parent provides credit assurances on behalf of its subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, in the form of guarantees.  Management does not anticipate a material impact to net income or cash flows as a result of these various guarantees and indemnifications.

The following table summarizes Eversource parent's exposure to guarantees and indemnifications of its subsidiaries and affiliates to external parties as of

December 31, 2019

:

(1)

Surety bond expiration dates reflect termination dates, the majority of which will be renewed or extended.  Certain surety bonds contain credit ratings triggers that would require Eversource parent to post collateral in the event that the unsecured debt credit ratings of Eversource parent are downgraded.

(2)

On October 25, 2019, Eversource parent issued a guaranty on behalf of its


percent

-owned affiliate, Sunrise Wind LLC, whereby Eversource parent will guaranty Sunrise Wind LLC's performance of certain obligations, in an amount not to exceed

$

15.4

million

, under the Offshore Wind Renewable Energy Certificate Purchase and Sale Agreement (the Agreement).  The Agreement was executed on October 25, 2019, by and between NYSERDA and Sunrise Wind LLC.  Obligations of Eversource parent under the guaranty expire at such time as the guaranteed obligations have been fully performed.  The Company regularly reviews performance risk under this arrangement, and in the event it becomes probable that Eversource parent will be required to perform under the guarantee, the amount of probable payment will be recorded.  As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the guarantee was immaterial

.

Eversource parent issued a guaranty on behalf of its subsidiary, NPT, under which, beginning at the time the Northern Pass Transmission line would go into commercial operation, Eversource parent would guarantee the financial obligations of NPT under the TSA with HQ in an amount not to exceed

$


million

.  Eversource parent's obligations under the guaranty expire upon the full, final and indefeasible payment of the guaranteed obligations.  In the second quarter of 2019, Eversource concluded that construction of the NPT project was no longer probable.  For further information regarding the impairment of NPT, see Note 1D, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Impairment of Northern Pass Transmission," to the financial statements.  While this guaranty is currently outstanding, it is expected to be extinguished in connection with the final dissolution of NPT.

E.

FERC ROE Complaints

Four

separate complaints were filed at the FERC by combinations of New England state attorneys general, state regulatory commissions, consumer advocates, consumer groups, municipal parties and other parties (collectively, the Complainants).  In each of the first

three

complaints, filed on October 1, 2011, December 27, 2012, and July 31, 2014, respectively, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE of

11.14

percent

that had been utilized since 2005 and sought an order to reduce it prospectively from the date of the final FERC order and for the separate


-month complaint periods.  In the fourth complaint, filed April 29, 2016, the Complainants challenged the NETOs' base ROE billed of

10.57

percent

and the maximum ROE for transmission incentive (incentive cap) of

11.74

percent

, asserting that these ROEs were unjust and unreasonable.

The ROE originally billed during the period October 1, 2011 (beginning of the first complaint period) through October 15, 2014 consisted of a base ROE of

11.14

percent

and incentives up to

13.1

percent

.  On October 16, 2014, the FERC set the base ROE at

10.57

percent

and the incentive cap at

11.74

percent

for the first complaint period.  This was also effective for all prospective billings to customers beginning October 16, 2014.  This FERC order was vacated on April 14, 2017 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (the Court).

All amounts associated with the first complaint period have been refunded, which totaled

$

38.9

million

(pre-tax and excluding interest) at Eversource and reflected both the base ROE and incentive cap prescribed by the FERC order.  The refund consisted of

$

22.4

million

for CL&P,

$

13.7

million

for NSTAR Electric and

$

2.8

million

for PSNH.

Eversource has recorded a reserve of

$

39.1

million

(pre-tax and excluding interest) for the second complaint period as of

December 31, 2019

.  This reserve represents the difference between the billed rates during the second complaint period and a

10.57

percent

base ROE and

11.74

percent

incentive cap.  The reserve consisted of

$

21.4

million

for CL&P,

$

14.6

million

for NSTAR Electric and

$

3.1

million

for PSNH as of

December 31, 2019

.

On October 16, 2018, FERC issued an order on all four complaints describing how it intends to address the issues that were remanded by the Court.  FERC proposed a new framework to determine (1) whether an existing ROE is unjust and unreasonable and, if so, (2) how to calculate a replacement ROE.  Initial briefs were filed by the NETOs, Complainants and FERC Trial Staff on January 11, 2019 and reply briefs were filed on March 8, 2019.  The NETOs' brief was supportive of the overall ROE methodology determined in the October 16, 2018 order provided the FERC does not change the proposed methodology or alter its implementation in a manner that has a material impact on the results.

The FERC order included illustrative calculations for the first complaint using FERC's proposed frameworks with financial data from that complaint.  Those illustrative calculations indicated that for the first complaint period, for the NETOs, which FERC concludes are of average financial risk, the preliminary just and reasonable base ROE is

10.41

percent

and the preliminary incentive cap on total ROE is

13.08

percent

.

If the results of the illustrative calculations were included in a final FERC order for each of the complaint periods, then a

10.41

percent

base ROE and a

13.08

percent

incentive cap would not have a significant impact on our financial statements for all of the complaint periods.  These preliminary calculations are not binding and do not represent what we believe to be the most likely outcome of a final FERC order.

On November 21, 2019, FERC issued an order concerning the transmission ROEs for the Midcontinent ISO transmission owners (MISO).  In that order, FERC adopted another new methodology for determining base ROEs for MISO, which differed significantly from the methodology and framework set forth in its October 16, 2018 FERC order on the NETOs’ ROE dockets.  On December 23, 2019, the NETOs filed a Supplemental Paper Hearing Brief and a Motion to supplement the record in the NETO ROE dockets to respond to the new methodology proposed in the MISO order, as there is uncertainty to whether it may be applied to the NETOs’ cases.  On January 21, 2020, the FERC issued an order granting rehearing for further consideration to give the FERC more time to act on the substantive issues of the MISO ROE proceedings.  Further changes to the methodology by FERC are possible as a result of the arguments in both the MISO and NETO proceedings.  Given the significant uncertainty relating to the October 2018 FERC order, the November 2019 FERC order to MISO, and the FERC's rehearing of the MISO order, the Company is unable to predict the potential effect of the MISO order on the NETO complaints or the outcome of the four complaints and concluded that there is


no reasonable basis for a change to the reserve or recognized ROEs for any of the complaint periods at this time.  Further, the Company cannot reasonably estimate a range of gain or loss for any of the

four

complaint proceedings.

Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH currently record revenues at the

10.57

percent

base ROE and incentive cap at

11.74

percent

established in the October 16, 2014 FERC order.

A change of


basis points to the base ROE used to establish the reserves would impact Eversource’s after-tax earnings by an average of approximately

$


million

for each of the four 15-month complaint periods.

F.    Eversource and NSTAR Electric Boston Harbor Civil Action

On July 15, 2016, the United States Attorney on behalf of the United States Army Corps of Engineers filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts under provisions of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 and the Clean Water Act against NSTAR Electric, HEEC, and the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (together with NSTAR Electric and HEEC, the Defendants).  The action alleged that the Defendants failed to comply with certain permitting requirements related to the placement of the HEEC-owned electric distribution cable beneath Boston Harbor.  The action sought an order to compel HEEC to comply with cable depth requirements in the United States Army Corps of Engineers' permit or alternatively to remove the electric distribution cable and cease unauthorized work in U.S. waterways.  The action also sought civil penalties and other costs.

The parties reached a settlement pursuant to which HEEC agreed to install a new


kV distribution cable across Boston Harbor to Deer Island, utilizing a different route, and remove portions of the existing cable.  Upon the installation and completion of the new cable and the removal of the portions of the existing cable, all issues surrounding the current permit from the United States Army Corps of Engineers are expected to be resolved, and such litigation is expected to be dismissed with prejudice. Construction of the new distribution cable was completed in August 2019 and removal of the portions of the existing cable was completed in January 2020.

NSTAR Electric agreed to provide a rate base credit of

$

17.5

million

to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority for the new cable.  This negotiated credit resulted in the initial

$

17.5

million

of construction costs on the new cable being expensed as incurred, all of which was fully expensed in 2018.  In connection with the new cable that was placed into service, a corresponding ARO was recognized for approximately

$


million

within Other Long-Term Liabilities on the Eversource and NSTAR Electric balance sheets as of December 31, 2019.  For further information on the ARO, see Note 7, "Asset Retirement Obligations," to the financial statements.

G.     Litigation and Legal Proceedings

Eversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, are involved in legal, tax and regulatory proceedings regarding matters arising in the ordinary course of business, which involve management's assessment to determine the probability of whether a loss will occur and, if probable, its best estimate of probable loss.  The Company records and discloses losses when these losses are probable and reasonably estimable, and discloses matters when losses are probable but not estimable or when losses are reasonably possible.  Legal costs related to the defense of loss contingencies are expensed as incurred.

14.

GENERATION ASSET SALE

On January 10, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its thermal generation assets.  The original purchase price of

$


million

was adjusted to reflect working capital adjustments, closing date adjustments and proration of taxes and fees prior to closing.  As a result of these adjustments, net proceeds from the sale of the thermal assets totaled

$

116.8

million

.  On August 26, 2018, PSNH completed the sale of its hydroelectric generation assets.  The original purchase price of

$


million

was adjusted to reflect contractual adjustments totaling

$

5.8

million

, resulting in net proceeds of

$

77.2

million

.  The difference between the carrying value of the hydroelectric generation assets and the sale proceeds resulted in a gain of

$

17.3

million

.  An estimated gain from the sale of these assets was included as an offset to the total remaining costs associated with the sale of generation assets that were securitized on May 8, 2018.

On May 8, 2018, PSNH Funding issued

$

635.7

million

of securitized RRBs to finance PSNH's unrecovered remaining costs resulting from the divestiture of its generation assets, which included the deferred costs resulting from the sale of the thermal generation assets.  These RRBs are secured by a non-bypassable charge recoverable from PSNH customers.  PSNH recorded regulatory assets and other deferred costs in connection with the generation asset divestiture and the securitization of remaining costs, which are probable of recovery through collection of the non-bypassable charge.  As of

December 31, 2019

and 2018, unamortized securitized stranded costs totaled

$

565.3

million

and

$

608.4

million

, respectively, and are included in Regulatory Assets on the Eversource and PSNH balance sheets.  For further information on the securitized RRB issuance, see Note 10, "Rate Reduction Bonds and Variable Interest Entities."

On November 27, 2019, PSNH filed a motion for the commencement of audit of divestiture-related costs.  PSNH’s actual balance of costs eligible for recovery as divestiture-related costs is

$

654.0

million

, which is above the

$

635.7

million

amount securitized in May 2018.  PSNH proposed to recover this balance through the SCRC tracker mechanism and believes the amount deferred is probable of recovery.  These deferred costs are recorded in Other Long-Term Assets on the balance sheet.

For the year ended December 31, 2018, pre-tax income associated with the hydroelectric assets prior to the sale on August 26, 2018 was

$

9.9

million

.  For the year ended December 31, 2017, pre-tax income associated with PSNH's generation assets was

$

60.0

million

.  As of December 31, 2018, all generation assets had been sold.


15.

LEASES

Eversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, has entered into lease agreements as a lessee for the use of land, office space, service centers, vehicles, information technology, and equipment.  These lease agreements are classified as either finance or operating leases and the liability and right-of-use asset are recognized on the balance sheet at lease commencement.  Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet and are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Eversource determines whether or not a contract contains a lease based on whether or not it provides Eversource with the use of a specifically identified asset for a period of time, as well as both the right to direct the use of that asset and receive the significant economic benefits of the asset.  Eversource has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components and instead to account for both as a single lease component, with the exception of the information technology asset class where the lease and non-lease components are separated.

The provisions of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH lease agreements contain renewal options.  The renewal options range from

one year

to

twenty years

.  The renewal period is included in the measurement of the lease liability if it is reasonably certain that Eversource will exercise these renewal options.

For leases entered into or modified after the January 1, 2019 implementation date, the discount rate utilized for classification and measurement purposes as of the inception date of the lease is based on each company's collateralized incremental interest rate to borrow over a comparable term for an individual lease because the rate implicit in the lease is not determinable.

CL&P and PSNH entered into certain contracts for the purchase of energy that qualify as leases.  These contracts do not have minimum lease payments and therefore are not recognized as a lease liability on the balance sheet and are not reflected in the future minimum lease payments table below.  Expense related to these contracts is included as variable lease cost in the table below.  The expense and long-term obligation for these contracts are also included in Note 13B, "Commitments and Contingencies - Long-Term Contractual Arrangements," to the financial statements.

The components of lease cost, prior to amounts capitalized, are as follows:

Operating lease rental payments charged to expense in 2018 and 2017 (which exclude CL&P's and PSNH's energy purchase contracts) were as follows:

Operating lease cost, net of the capitalized portion, is included in Operations and Maintenance (or Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission expense for transmission segment leases) on the statements of income.  Amortization of finance lease assets is included in Depreciation on the statements of income.  Interest expense on finance leases is included in Interest Expense on the statements of income.


Supplemental balance sheet information related to leases is as follows:

The finance lease payments that NSTAR Electric will make over the next twelve months are entirely interest-related, due to escalating payments.  As such, none of the finance lease payments over the next twelve months will reduce the finance lease liability.

Other information related to leases is as follows (in millions of dollars, unless otherwise noted):

Future minimum lease payments, excluding variable costs, under long-term leases, as of December 31, 2019 are as follows:


At December 31, 2018, future minimum rental payments, excluding executory costs, such as property taxes, state use taxes, insurance, and maintenance were as follows:

16.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each of the following financial instruments:

Preferred Stock, Long-Term Debt and Rate Reduction Bonds:

The fair value of CL&P's and NSTAR Electric's preferred stock is based upon pricing models that incorporate interest rates and other market factors, valuations or trades of similar securities and cash flow projections.  The fair value of long-term debt and RRB debt securities is based upon pricing models that incorporate quoted market prices for those issues or similar issues adjusted for market conditions, credit ratings of the respective companies and treasury benchmark yields.

The fair values provided in the table below are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.  Carrying amounts and estimated fair values are as follows:

Derivative Instruments and Marketable Securities:

Derivative instruments and investments in marketable securities are carried at fair value.  For further information, see Note 4, "Derivative Instruments," and Note 5, "Marketable Securities," to the financial statements.

See Note 1I, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Fair Value Measurements," for the fair value measurement policy and the fair value hierarchy.


17.

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS)

The changes in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) by component, net of tax, are as follows:

Eversource's qualified cash flow hedging instruments represent interest rate swap agreements on debt issuances that were settled in prior years. The settlement amount was recorded in AOCI and is being amortized into Net Income over the term of the underlying debt instrument.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH continue to amortize interest rate swaps settled in prior years from AOCI into Interest Expense over the remaining life of the associated long-term debt. Such interest rate swaps are not material to their respective financial statements.

Defined benefit plan OCI amounts before reclassifications relate to actuarial gains and losses that arose during the year and were recognized in AOCI.  The unamortized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs on the defined benefit plans are amortized from AOCI into Other Income, Net over the average future employee service period, and are reflected in amounts reclassified from AOCI.  The related tax effects recognized in AOCI were net deferred tax assets of

$

4.4

million

and

$

4.1

million

in 2019 and 2017, respectively, and deferred tax liabilities of

$

0.2

million

in 2018.

Eversource did not elect to reclassify the income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act from AOCI to Retained Earnings as permitted by ASU 2018-02,

Income Statement

–

Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220).

The following table sets forth the amounts reclassified from AOCI by component and the impacted line item on the statements of income:

(1)

These amounts are included in the computation of net periodic Pension, SERP and PBOP costs.  See Note 1M, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Other Income, Net" and Note 11A, "Employee Benefits – Pension Benefits and Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pension," for further information.

As of

December 31, 2019

, it is estimated that a pre-tax amount of

$

2.5

million

(

$

0.7

million

for NSTAR Electric and

$

1.8

million

for PSNH) will be reclassified from AOCI as a decrease to Net Income over the next 12 months as a result of the amortization of the interest rate swap agreements which have been settled.  In addition, it is estimated that a pre-tax amount of

$

7.8

million

will be reclassified from AOCI as a decrease to Net Income over the next 12 months as a result of the amortization of Pension, SERP and PBOP costs.


18.

DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS

Eversource parent's ability to pay dividends may be affected by certain state statutes, the ability of its subsidiaries to pay common dividends and the leverage restriction tied to its consolidated total debt to total capitalization ratio requirement in its revolving credit agreement.  Pursuant to the joint revolving credit agreement of Eversource, CL&P, PSNH, NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas and Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, and to the NSTAR Electric revolving credit agreement, each company is required to maintain consolidated total indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of no greater than


percent at the end of each fiscal quarter.  As of

December 31, 2019

, all companies were in compliance with such covenant and in compliance with all such provisions of the revolving credit agreements that may restrict the payment of dividends as of

December 31, 2019

.

The Retained Earnings balances subject to dividend restrictions were

$

4.2

billion

for Eversource,

$

1.8

billion

for CL&P,

$

2.3

billion

for NSTAR Electric and

$

490.3

million

for PSNH as of

December 31, 2019

.

CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are subject to Section 305 of the Federal Power Act that makes it unlawful for a public utility to make or pay a dividend from any funds "properly included in its capital account."  Management believes that this Federal Power Act restriction, as applied to CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, would not be construed or applied by the FERC to prohibit the payment of dividends from retained earnings for lawful and legitimate business purposes.  In addition, certain state statutes may impose additional limitations on such companies and on NSTAR Gas, Yankee Gas, Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut, Aquarion Water Company of Massachusetts and Aquarion Water Company of New Hampshire.  Such state law restrictions do not restrict the payment of dividends from retained earnings or net income.

19.

COMMON SHARES

The following table sets forth the Eversource parent common shares and the shares of common stock of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that were authorized and issued, as well as the respective per share par values:

Common Share Issuance and Forward Sale Agreement:

On June 4, 2019, Eversource completed an equity offering of

17,940,000

common shares, consisting of

5,980,000

common shares issued directly by the Company and

11,960,000

common shares issuable pursuant to a forward sale agreement with an investment bank.  The issuance of

5,980,000

common shares resulted in proceeds of

$

426.9

million

, net of issuance costs.

Under the forward sale agreement, a total of

11,960,000

common shares were borrowed from third parties and sold by the underwriters.  The forward sale agreement allows Eversource, at its election and prior to May 29, 2020, to physically settle the forward sale agreement by issuing common shares in exchange for net proceeds at the then-applicable forward sale price specified by the agreement (initially,

$

71.48

per share) or, alternatively, to settle the forward sale agreement in whole or in part through the delivery or receipt of shares or cash.  The forward sale price is subject to adjustment daily based on a floating interest rate factor and will decrease in respect of certain fixed amounts specified in the agreement, such as dividends.

On December 30, 2019, Eversource physically settled a portion of the forward sale agreement by delivering

6,000,000

common shares in exchange for net proceeds of

$

425.4

million

.  The forward sale price used to determine the cash proceeds received by Eversource was calculated based on the initial forward sale price of

$

71.48

per share, as adjusted in accordance with the forward sale agreement.

The 2019 issuances of

11,980,000

common shares resulted in proceeds of

$

852.3

million

, net of issuance costs, and were reflected in shareholders’ equity and as financing activities on the statement of cash flows.

Eversource’s intent is to physically settle the forward sale agreement by issuing common shares.  As of

December 31, 2019

, if Eversource had elected to net settle the forward sale agreement, Eversource would have been required to pay

$

84.4

million

under a cash settlement or would have been required to deliver

992,189

common shares under a net share settlement.

Issuances of shares under the forward sale agreement are classified as equity transactions.  Accordingly, no amounts relating to the forward sale agreement have or will be recorded in the financial statements until settlements take place.  Prior to any settlements, the only impact to the financial statements is the inclusion of incremental shares within the calculation of diluted EPS using the treasury stock method.  See Note 22, "Earnings Per Share," to the financial statements for information on the forward sale agreement’s impact on the calculation of diluted EPS.

Eversource used the net proceeds received upon the direct issuance of common shares and the net proceeds received upon partial settlement of the forward sale agreement to repay short-term debt under the commercial paper program, to fund capital spending and clean energy initiatives, and for general corporate purposes.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic EPS is computed based upon the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period.  Diluted EPS is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the potential dilutive effect of certain share-based compensation awards and the equity forward sale agreement, as if they were converted into outstanding common shares.  The dilutive effect of unvested RSU and performance share awards, as well as the equity forward sale agreement, is calculated using the treasury stock method.  RSU and performance share awards are included in basic weighted average common shares outstanding as of the date that all necessary vesting conditions have been satisfied.

As described in Note 19, "Common Shares," earnings per share dilution, if any, related to the forward sale agreement will be determined under the treasury stock method until settlement of the forward sale agreement.  Under this method, the number of Eversource common shares used in calculating diluted EPS is deemed to be increased by the excess, if any, of the number of shares that would be issued upon physical settlement of the forward sale agreement less the number of shares that would be purchased by Eversource in the market (based on the average market price during the same reporting period) using the proceeds receivable upon settlement (based on the adjusted forward sale price at the end of that reporting period).  Share dilution occurs when the average market price of Eversource's common shares is higher than the adjusted forward sale price.

The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted EPS:

REVENUES

On January 1, 2018, Eversource, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, adopted ASU 2014-09, “

Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)

” using the modified retrospective approach.

The core principle of this accounting guidance is that revenue is recognized when promised goods or services (referred to as performance obligations) are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  A five-step model is used for recognizing and measuring revenue from contracts with customers, which includes identifying the contract with the customer, identifying the performance obligations promised within the contract, determining the transaction price (the amount of consideration to which the company expects to be entitled), allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations and recognizing revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is satisfied.

The following table presents operating revenues disaggregated by revenue source:


Retail Tariff Sales:

Regulated utilities provide products and services to their regulated customers under rates, pricing, payment terms and conditions of service, regulated by each state regulatory agency.  The arrangement whereby a utility provides commodity service to a customer for a price approved by the respective state regulatory commission is referred to as a tariff sale contract, and the tariff governs all aspects of the provision of regulated services by utilities.  The majority of revenue for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH is derived from regulated retail tariff sales for the sale and distribution of electricity, natural gas and water to residential, commercial and industrial retail customers.

The utility's performance obligation for the regulated tariff sales is to provide electricity, natural gas or water to the customer as demanded.  The promise to provide the commodity represents a single performance obligation, as it is a promise to transfer a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer.  Revenue is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits provided by the utility, and the utility satisfies its performance obligation.  Revenue is recognized based on the output method as there is a directly observable output to the customer (electricity, natural gas or water units delivered to the customer and immediately consumed).  Each Eversource utility is entitled to be compensated for performance completed to date (service taken by the customer) until service is terminated.

In regulated tariff sales, the transaction prices are the rates approved by the respective state regulatory commissions.  In general, rates can only be changed through formal proceedings with the state regulatory commissions.  These rates are designed to recover the costs to provide service to customers and include a return on investment.  Regulatory commission-approved tracking mechanisms are included in these rates and are also used to recover, on a fully-reconciling basis, certain costs, such as the procurement of energy supply, retail transmission charges, energy efficiency program costs, net metering for distributed generation, and restructuring and stranded costs.  These tracking mechanisms result in rates being changed periodically to ensure recovery of actual costs incurred.

Customers may elect to purchase electricity from each Eversource electric utility or may contract separately with a competitive third party supplier.   Revenue is not recorded for the sale of the electricity commodity to customers who have contracted separately with these suppliers, only the delivery to a customer, as the utility is acting as an agent on behalf of the third party supplier.


Wholesale Transmission Revenues:

The Eversource electric transmission-owning companies (CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH) each own and maintain transmission facilities that are part of an interstate power transmission grid over which electricity is transmitted throughout New England.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, as well as most other New England utilities, are parties to a series of agreements that provide for coordinated planning and operation of the region's transmission facilities and the rules by which they acquire transmission services.  The Eversource electric transmission-owning companies have a combination of FERC-approved regional and local formula rates that work in tandem to recover all their transmission costs.  These rates are part of the ISO-NE Tariff.  Regional rates recover the costs of higher voltage transmission facilities that benefit the region and are collected from all New England transmission customers, including the Eversource distribution businesses.  Eversource's local rates recover the companies' total transmission revenue requirements, less revenues received from regional rates and other sources, and are collected from Eversource's distribution businesses and other transmission customers.  The distribution businesses of Eversource, in turn, recover the FERC approved charges from retail customers through annual or semiannual tracking mechanisms, which are retail tariff sales.

The utility's performance obligation for regulated wholesale transmission sales is to provide transmission services to the customer as demanded.  The promise to provide transmission service represents a single performance obligation.  The transaction prices are the transmission rate formulas as defined by the ISO-NE Tariff and are regulated and established by FERC.  Wholesale transmission revenue is recognized over time as the performance obligation is completed, which occurs as transmission services are provided to customers.  The revenue is recognized based on the output method.  Each Eversource utility is entitled to be compensated for performance completed to date (e.g., use of the transmission system by the customer).

Wholesale Market Sales Revenues:

Wholesale market sales transactions include sales of energy and energy-related products into the ISO-NE wholesale electricity market, sales of natural gas to third party marketers, and also the sale of RECs to various counterparties.  ISO-NE oversees the region's wholesale electricity market and administers the transactions and terms and conditions, including payment terms, which are established in the ISO-NE tariff, between the buyers and sellers in the market.  Pricing is set by the wholesale market.  The wholesale transactions in the ISO-NE market occur on a day-ahead basis or a real-time basis (daily) and are, therefore, short-term.  Transactions are tracked and reported by ISO-NE net by the hour, which is the net hourly position of energy sales and purchases by each market participant.  Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the performance obligation for ISO-NE energy transactions is defined to be the net by hour transaction.  Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation for these energy sales transactions is satisfied, when the sale occurs and the energy is transferred to the customer.  For sales of natural gas, transportation, and natural gas pipeline capacity to third party marketers, revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time the sale occurs and the natural gas or related product is transferred to the marketer.  RECs are sold to various counterparties, and revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied upon transfer of title to the customer through the New England Power Pool Generation Information System.

Other Revenues from Contracts with Customers:

Other revenues from contracts with customers primarily include property rentals that are not deemed leases.  These revenues are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over time as the service is provided to the customer.  Other revenues also include revenues from Eversource's service company, which is eliminated in consolidation.

Reserve for Revenues Subject to Refund:

Current base rates include an estimate of income taxes, which was based on the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in effect at the time of the rate proceeding.  Eversource established a regulatory liability, recorded as a reduction to revenue, to reflect the difference between the 35 percent federal corporate income tax rate included in rates charged to customers and the 21 percent federal corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, until rates billed to customers reflect the lower federal tax rate.  Effective May 1, 2018, CL&P adjusted distribution rates billed to customers to reflect the lower federal income tax rate prospectively and, as of December 31, 2018, fully refunded its regulatory liability associated with the higher federal corporate income tax rate billed to customers in the period between January 1, 2018 through April 30, 2018.  Effective November 15, 2018, Yankee Gas adjusted distribution rates to reflect the lower federal income tax rate prospectively and to refund its regulatory liability associated with the higher federal corporate income tax rate billed to customers in the period between January 1, 2018 through November 14, 2018.  Effective July 1, 2019, PSNH adjusted temporary distribution rates to reflect the lower federal income tax rate prospectively and to refund its regulatory liability associated with the higher federal corporate income tax rate billed to customers in the period between January 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019.  For NSTAR Electric and NSTAR Gas, a December 2018 DPU order indicated that the DPU would not require a revision to base distribution rates for any potential refunds associated with the higher federal corporate income tax rate billed to customers in the period between January 1, 2018 to the effective dates of each company's rate changes (effective February 1, 2018 for NSTAR Electric and July 1, 2018 for NSTAR Gas).

Alternative Revenue Programs:

In accordance with accounting guidance for rate-regulated operations, certain of Eversource's utilities' rate making mechanisms qualify as alternative revenue programs (ARPs) if they meet specified criteria, in which case revenues may be recognized prior to billing based on allowed levels of collection in rates.  Eversource's utility companies recognize revenue and record a regulatory asset or liability once the condition or event allowing for the automatic adjustment of future rates occurs.  ARP revenues include both the recognition of the deferral adjustment to ARP revenues, when the regulator-specified condition or event allowing for additional billing or refund has occurred, and an equal and offsetting reversal of the ARP deferral to revenues as those amounts are reflected in the price of service in subsequent periods.

Eversource’s ARPs include the revenue decoupling mechanism and the annual reconciliation adjustment to transmission formula rates, described below.

•

Certain Eversource electric, natural gas and water companies, including CL&P and NSTAR Electric, have revenue decoupling mechanisms approved by a regulatory commission (decoupled companies).  Decoupled companies’ distribution revenues are not directly based on sales volumes.  The decoupled companies reconcile their annual base distribution rate recovery to pre-established levels of baseline distribution delivery service revenues, with any difference between the allowed level of distribution revenue and the actual amount realized adjusted through subsequent rates.


•

The transmission formula rates provide for the annual reconciliation and recovery or refund of estimated costs to actual costs.  The financial impacts of differences between actual and estimated costs are deferred for future recovery from, or refund to, transmission customers.  This transmission deferral reconciles billed transmission revenues to the revenue requirement for our transmission businesses.

Other Revenues:

Other Revenues include certain fees charged to customers that are not considered revenue from contracts with customers and lease revenues under lessor accounting guidance.  Lease revenues totaled

$

4.4

million

at Eversource,

$

1.0

million

at CL&P, and

$

2.7

million

at NSTAR Electric for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Intercompany Eliminations:

Intercompany eliminations are primarily related to the Eversource electric transmission revenues that are derived from ISO-NE regional transmission charges to the distribution businesses of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH that recover the costs of the wholesale transmission business, and revenues from Eversource's service company.  Intercompany revenues and expenses between the Eversource wholesale transmission businesses and the Eversource distribution businesses and from Eversource's service company are eliminated in consolidation and included in "Eliminations" in the table above.

Receivables:

Receivables, Net on the balance sheet include trade receivables from our retail customers and receivables arising from ISO-NE billing related to wholesale transmission contracts and wholesale market transactions, sales of natural gas and capacity to marketers, sales of RECs, and property rentals.  In general, retail tariff customers and wholesale transmission customers are billed monthly and the payment terms are generally due and payable upon receipt of the bill.

Unbilled Revenues:

Unbilled Revenues on the balance sheet represent estimated amounts due from retail customers for electricity, natural gas or water delivered to customers but not yet billed.  The utility company has satisfied its performance obligation and the customer has received and consumed the commodity as of the balance sheet date, and therefore, the utility company records revenue for those services in the period the services were provided.  Only the passage of time is required before the company is entitled to payment for the satisfaction of the performance obligation.  Payment from customers is due monthly as services are rendered and amounts are billed.  Actual amounts billed to customers when meter readings become available may vary from the estimated amount.

Unbilled revenues are recognized by allocating estimated unbilled sales volumes to the respective customer classes, and then applying an estimated rate by customer class to those sales volumes.  Unbilled revenue estimates reflect seasonality, weather, customer usage patterns, customer rates in effect for customer classes, and the timing of customer billing.  The companies that have a decoupling mechanism record a regulatory deferral to reflect the actual allowed amount of revenue associated with their respective decoupled distribution rate design.

Practical Expedients:

Eversource has elected practical expedients in the accounting guidance that allow the company to record revenue in the amount that the company has a right to invoice, if that amount corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the company's performance to date, and not to disclose related unsatisfied performance obligations.  Retail and wholesale transmission tariff sales fall into this category, as these sales are recognized as revenue in the period the utility provides the service and completes the performance obligation, which is the same as the monthly amount billed to customers.  There are no other material revenue streams for which Eversource has unsatisfied performance obligations.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

Eversource is organized into the Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reportable segments and Other based on a combination of factors, including the characteristics of each segments' services, the sources of operating revenues and expenses and the regulatory environment in which each segment operates.  These reportable segments represent substantially all of Eversource's total consolidated revenues.  Revenues from the sale of electricity, natural gas and water primarily are derived from residential, commercial and industrial customers and are not dependent on any single customer.  The Electric Distribution reportable segment includes the results of PSNH's generation facilities prior to sales in January and August 2018, and NSTAR Electric's solar power facilities.  On December 4, 2017, Eversource acquired Aquarion, and its water distribution business was deemed a reportable segment beginning in 2018.  Eversource's reportable segments are determined based upon the level at which Eversource's chief operating decision maker assesses performance and makes decisions about the allocation of company resources.

The remainder of Eversource's operations is presented as Other in the tables below and primarily consists of 1) the equity in earnings of Eversource parent from its subsidiaries and intercompany interest income, both of which are eliminated in consolidation, and interest expense related to the debt of Eversource parent, 2) the revenues and expenses of Eversource Service, most of which are eliminated in consolidation, 3) the operations of CYAPC and YAEC, 4) Eversource Water Ventures, Inc., parent company of Aquarion, 5) the results of other unregulated subsidiaries, which are not part of its core business, and 6) Eversource parent's equity ownership interests that are not consolidated, which primarily include the offshore wind business, a

natural gas pipeline owned by Enbridge, Inc., and a renewable energy investment fund.

In the ordinary course of business, Yankee Gas and NSTAR Gas purchase natural gas transmission services from the Enbridge, Inc. natural gas pipeline project described above.  These affiliate transaction costs total

$

62.5

million

annually and are classified as Purchased Power, Fuel and Transmission on the Eversource statements of income.

Each of Eversource's subsidiaries, including CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, has

one

reportable segment.

Cash flows used for investments in plant included in the segment information below are cash capital expenditures that do not include amounts incurred but not paid, cost of removal, AFUDC related to equity funds, and the capitalized portions of pension and PBOP expense.


Eversource's segment information is as follows:


(1)

Effective January 1, 2018, upon implementation of the new revenue accounting guidance, the electric distribution segment is presented gross and intercompany transmission billings are presented in the eliminations column, as Eversource believes that the electric distribution segment acts as a principal, rather than an agent, in its contracts with retail customers.  Retail customers contract directly with the electric distribution utility and do not differentiate between distribution and transmission services.  Therefore, the electric distribution segment revenues, which are derived from retail customer billings, are presented gross of the eliminations.  Prior to 2018, the electric distribution segment presented intercompany electric transmission billings net, based on indicators of net presentation prior to the new revenue guidance.  See Note 23 "Revenues," to the financial statements regarding accounting for revenues.

See Note 1B, "Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Basis of Presentation," for information regarding the correction of cash investments in plant reported in 2018.

ACQUISITION OF AQUARION AND GOODWILL

A.    Acquisition of Aquarion

On December 4, 2017, Eversource acquired Aquarion for a purchase price of

$

1.675

billion

, consisting of approximately

$


million

in cash and

$


million

of assumed Aquarion debt.  Aquarion is a holding company that owns three separate regulated water utility subsidiaries engaged in the water collection, treatment and distribution business that operate in Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Hampshire.  These regulated utilities collect, treat and distribute water to residential, commercial and industrial customers, to other utilities for resale, and for private and municipal fire protection.  Aquarion and its subsidiaries became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Eversource, and Eversource's consolidated financial information includes Aquarion and its subsidiaries' activity beginning December 4, 2017.  The approximate

$


million

cash purchase price included the

$


million

equity purchase price plus a

$


million

shareholder loan that was repaid at closing.

Pro Forma Financial Information:

The following unaudited pro forma financial information reflects the pro forma combined results of operations of Eversource and Aquarion and reflects the amortization of purchase price adjustments assuming the acquisition had taken place on January 1, 2017.

The unaudited pro forma financial information has been presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the consolidated results of operations that would have been achieved or the future consolidated results of operations of Eversource.

Aquarion Revenues and Pre-Tax Income:

The impact of Aquarion on Eversource's accompanying consolidated statement of income included operating revenues of

$

15.9

million

and pre-tax income of

$

1.1

million

for the year ended December 31, 2017.

B.    Goodwill

In a business combination, the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed

is recognized as goodwill.  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually and more frequently if indicators of impairment arise.  In accordance with the accounting standards, if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value (including goodwill), the goodwill is tested for impairment.  Goodwill is not subject to amortization, however is subject to a fair value based assessment for impairment at least annually and whenever facts or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment.  A resulting write-down, if any, would be charged to Operating Expenses.

Eversource's reporting units for the purpose of testing goodwill are Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution.  These reporting units are consistent with the operating segments underlying the reportable segments identified in Note 24, "Segment Information," to the financial statements.

Eversource completed its annual goodwill impairment test for Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution and Water Distribution reporting units as of October 1,


and determined that

no

impairment existed.  There were no events subsequent to October 1,


that indicated impairment of goodwill.  The annual goodwill assessment included an evaluation of the Company's share price and credit ratings, analyst reports, financial performance, cost and risk factors, long-term strategy, growth and future projections, as well as macroeconomic, industry and market conditions.  This evaluation required the consideration of several factors that impact the fair value of the reporting units, including conditions and assumptions that affect the future cash flows of the reporting units.  Key considerations include discount rates, utility sector market performance and merger transaction multiples, and internal estimates of future cash flows and net income.

The following table presents goodwill by reportable segment as of

December 31, 2019

Item 9.    Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

No events that would be described in response to this item have occurred with respect to Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric or PSNH.

Item 9A.    Controls and Procedures

Management, on behalf of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, is responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of the accompanying Financial Statements and other sections of this combined Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Eversource's internal controls over financial reporting were audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP.

Management, on behalf of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting.  The internal control framework and processes have been designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.  There are inherent limitations of internal controls over financial reporting that could allow material misstatements due to error or fraud to occur and not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by employees during the normal course of business.  Additionally, internal controls over financial reporting may become inadequate in the future due to changes in the business environment.  Under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, an evaluation of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting was conducted based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework

(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).  Based on this evaluation under the framework in COSO, management concluded that internal controls over financial reporting at Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH were effective as of December 31,


.

Management, on behalf of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH, evaluated the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31,


to determine whether they are effective in ensuring that the disclosure of required information is made timely and in accordance with the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations of the SEC.  This evaluation was made under management's supervision and with management's participation, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  There are inherent limitations of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumventing or overriding of the controls and procedures.  Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.  The principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded, based on their review, that the disclosure controls and procedures of Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (i) is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and regulations and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to management, including the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

There have been no changes in internal controls over financial reporting for Eversource, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH during the quarter ended December 31,


that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls over financial reporting.

Item 9B.    Other Information

No information is required to be disclosed under this item as of December 31,


, as this information has been previously disclosed in applicable reports on Form 8-K during the fourth quarter of

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

CL&P is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Eversource Energy.  Its board of directors consists entirely of executive officers of Eversource Energy system companies.  CL&P does not have a compensation committee, and the Compensation Committee of Eversource Energy's Board of Trustees determines compensation for the executive officers of CL&P, including their salaries, annual incentive awards and long-term incentive awards.  All of CL&P's "Named Executive Officers," as defined below, also serve as officers of Eversource Energy and one or more other subsidiaries of Eversource Energy.  Compensation set by the Compensation Committee of Eversource Energy (the Committee) and set forth herein is for services rendered to Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries by such officers in all capacities.

This Compensation Discussion and Analysis (CD&A) provides information about the principles behind Eversource Energy's compensation objectives, plans, policies and actions for the Named Executive Officers.  The discussion describes the specific components of Eversource Energy's compensation programs

and approach to executive compensation, how Eversource Energy measures performance, and how Eversource Energy's compensation principles were applied to compensation awards and decisions that were made by the Compensation Committee for the Named Executive Officers, as presented in the tables and narratives that follow. While this discussion focuses primarily on 2019 information, it also addresses decisions that were made in prior periods to the extent that these decisions are relevant to the full understanding of Eversource Energy's compensation programs and the decisions that were made regarding 2019 performance.  The CD&A also contains an assessment of performance measured against the established 2019 goals and additional accomplishments, the compensation awards made by the Compensation Committee, and other information relating to Eversource Energy's compensation programs, including:

Summary of 2019 Accomplishments

2019 was an exceptionally successful year, and in many respects, the most successful year in Eversource Energy's history. Eversource achieved Total Shareholder Return of 34.4 percent, had its best system reliability performance ever, and established Eversource as a clean energy and ESG industry leader.  Eversource's performance was outstanding in each area that is important to its shareholders, customers, employees and communities.  The following is a summary of some of Eversource's most important accomplishments in 2019:

2019 Financial Accomplishments

•

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE:

Eversource's 2019 earnings per share equaled $2.81 per share, and non-GAAP earnings per share equaled $3.45, which excludes an impairment charge of $0.64 per share relating to the Northern Pass Transmission Project.



Non-GAAP EPS presented in this CD&A excludes the impairment charge for the Northern Pass Transmission Project (NPT) of $0.64 per share.  Eversource Energy uses this non-GAAP financial measure to more fully compare and explain 2019 results without including the impact of the NPT impairment charge.  Management believes the NPT impairment charge is not indicative of Eversource Energy's ongoing performance.  Due to the nature and significance of the impairment charge on net income attributable to common shareholders, management believes that the non-GAAP presentation is a more meaningful representation of Eversource Energy's financial performance and provides additional information to readers in analyzing historical and future performance of the business.  Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to Eversource Energy's consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders.


•

DIVIDENDS PAID:

Eversource's Board of Trustees increased the annual dividend rate by 5.9 percent for 2019 to $2.14 per share, which exceeded the EEI index of companies' median dividend growth rate of 5.1 percent.  The dividend growth rate for the period 2017 - 2019 has averaged 6.3 percent, exceeding the utility industry average.

•

SHAREHOLDER RETURN:

Eversource's Total Shareholder Return in 2019 was 34.4 percent, compared to the 25.8 percent total shareholder return of the EEI Index and a 31.5 percent total shareholder return for the Standard & Poor's 500.  Eversource outperformed the EEI Index and the Standard & Poor's 500 over the last one-, three-, five- and 10-year periods.  An investment of $1,000 in Eversource common shares for the ten-year period beginning January 1, 2010 was worth $4,567 on December 31, 2019.  The following chart represents the comparative one-, three- five- and 10-year total shareholder returns for the periods ended December 31, 2019, respectively:

•

STOCK PRICE:

Eversource's stock price rose from $65.04 on January 1, 2019 to $85.07 on December 31, 2019, a gain of 30.8 percent, outperforming its peers.

•

CLEAN ENERGY:

Eversource has strengthened its prospects through new clean energy projects.  Eversource continued to expand its offshore wind partnership with Ørsted, the global leader of offshore wind development, through the acquisition of the Northeast U.S. assets of Deepwater Wind.  The partnership successfully bid into the New York clean energy request for proposals and was awarded a contract for 880 megawatts of offshore wind with the Sunrise Wind project, and advanced the New London State Pier agreement to support offshore wind construction.  The partnership is recognized as the leading developer of offshore wind in North America.  Eversource accelerated the original five-year electric vehicle charging program in Massachusetts to three years, and the program met its 2019 targets.  Also, Eversource commenced the construction process on two energy storage projects in Massachusetts, and in addition, Eversource's energy efficiency programs continue to be recognized as being best in the nation by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

•

CREDIT RATING:

Eversource holds an A- Corporate Credit Rating at Standard & Poor's.  There is no other utility with a higher credit rating in the EEI Index.


2019 Operational Accomplishments

•

RELIABILITY PERFORMANCE:

Electric System Reliability, measured by months between interruptions, was top decile for Eversource's industry and its best year ever.  Eversource's overall electric system reliability performance in 2019 improved by 26 percent; customer power interruptions were on average 21.6 months apart.

•

RESTORATION PERFORMANCE:

The average system outage duration was 59.2 minutes, a 23 percent improvement over 2018, also top decile and Eversource's best year ever.

•

SAFETY:

Eversource's safety performance of 0.7, measured by days away, restricted or transferred (DART) per 100 workers, has improved significantly since 2016 and continued to outperform the industry in 2019.


•

REGULATORY:

Eversource achieved very constructive regulatory outcomes, including an approximate $28 million temporary rate settlement approval at PSNH, successful recovery approval of Eversource's storm costs in the three states that it serves, and a negotiated settlement with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to align rate structure and create additional customer rate transparency.

•

CUSTOMER:

Eversource continued to advance its transformation of the customer experience with a new mobile application, improved accuracy of restoration time estimates, and further increases in customer digital engagement.

2019 Environmental, Social and Governance Accomplishments

•

SUSTAINABILITY:

Eversource's performance was ranked top decile within a peer group of comparably sized (market capitalization) U.S. utilities whose ESG performance is assessed by the two leading sustainability rating firms; this exceeded Eversource's goal of 75th percentile performance.  Eversource also announced its new, industry leading but attainable goal, to be the only U.S. investor owned energy utility to be carbon neutral by 2030.

•

COMMUNITY:

Eversource continued to make a significant impact in its communities through its corporate philanthropy programs and extensive employee community volunteer programs.  Eversource employees have more than doubled the hours they have devoted to volunteerism in the communities, from 15,000 hours in 2016 to over 37,000 hours in 2019.

•

DIVERSITY:

In 2019, 41 percent of Eversource's new hires and promotions into leadership roles were women or people of color, exceeding the goal of 40 percent.

•

EMPLOYEES:

Eversource advanced Diversity & Inclusion through continued leadership commitment and Active Diversity Councils and Business Resource Groups.  Eversource was recognized for its commitment to advancing women in the workplace, having been selected for the 2019 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index.   Eversource's 2019 Employee Pulse Survey reported significantly higher engagement by employees; survey scores continue to improve, increasing by 11 percent over the 2018 survey and 22 percent over the 2016 results.

•

AWARDS:

Eversource received numerous local and national awards recognizing it as a leader and catalyst in the areas of Sustainability and ESG, including:

•

In November 2019, Forbes magazine/JUST Capital ranked Eversource as the #1 energy and utilities company. The listing recognizes corporate responsibility and commitment to the local communities and celebrates public companies for their positive impact and leadership on priorities such as ethical leadership, environmental impact, customer treatment, fair pay and benefits, equal opportunity and shareholder return.

•

Newsweek magazine's Most Responsible Companies' review ranked Eversource the #1 utility company. The Newsweek listing is based on an analysis of a company's corporate social responsibility, as well as a public survey.

•

Eversource received the 2019 Department of Defense Employer Support Freedom Award, the highest employer award given by the U.S. government, recognizing its support of employees who are serving our country.

•

Eversource received the Boston Business Journal's Corporate Citizenship Award as one of the most charitable companies in Massachusetts.

Eversource placed as the #1 or #2 utility in the Best Investor Relations Program, Best CFO, Best IR Professional, Best ESG Metrics, and Best in Corporate Governance Categories.

Achievement of the 2019 performance goals, additional accomplishments and the Committee's assessment Eversource's and executive's performance are more fully described in the section below titled "2019 Annual Incentive Program."  Specific decisions regarding executive compensation based upon the Committee's assessment of Eversource's and executive's performance and market data are also described below.


Pay for Performance Philosophy

The Committee links the compensation of the executive officers, including the Named Executive Officers, to performance that will ultimately benefit Eversource's customers and shareholders. Eversource's compensation program is intended to attract and retain the best executive talent in the industry, motivate its executives to meet or exceed specific stretch financial and operational goals each year, and compensate its executives in a manner that aligns compensation directly with performance.  Eversource strives to provide executives with base salary, performance-based annual incentive compensation, and performance-based long-term incentive compensation opportunities that are competitive with market practices and that reward excellent performance.

Summary Compensation Table Versus Realized Pay Comparison - James J. Judge - Eversource CEO

Since the date of his election as CEO of Eversource, the realized pay of Mr. Judge has been substantially less than his total compensation as reported in the Summary Compensation Table (his reported pay).  This is because a large portion of Mr. Judge's reported pay consists of the annual increase in Mr. Judge's pension benefit, which as noted below, and in the section captioned, "Mr. Judge's Pension Benefit," does not represent actual earnings.  This is because the reported compensation as required by the SEC's regulation differs from an executive's actual earnings, referred to as "realized pay."  Realized pay, on the other hand, is the amount that Mr. Judge actually received during the three fiscal years noted.  As a result, Eversource believes that it is useful to compare his realized pay for each year with his reported pay for the same period as illustrated in the chart below.

Definitions for purposes of the preceding figures:

1.

SEC Summary Compensation Table Compensation:

(i) base salary paid in each year, (ii) actual bonus earned for each year, (iii) the grant date amount of LTI awards, (iv) value of actuarial change in pension value, and (v) all other compensation as shown in the Summary Compensation Table for each year.

2.

Realized Pay:

(i) base salary paid in each year; (ii) the actual bonus earned for each year; (iii) for performance shares and RSUs, the actual value earned upon vesting; and (iv) the value of all other compensation realized in each year, including 401k matching contribution, financial planning services, and a company-leased vehicle.  Realized pay for Eversource's CEO does not assign a value to pension benefits or change in benefit value, as pension benefits were not realized in 2017, 2018, or 2019.


Executive Compensation Governance

•

Eversource's executive share ownership and holding guidelines noted in this CD&A emphasize the importance of aligning management with shareholders.  Under the share ownership guidelines, which require Eversource's Chief Executive Officer to hold shares equal to six times base salary, Eversource requires its executives to hold 100 percent of the shares awarded under the stock compensation program until the share ownership guidelines have been met.

•

Eversource's incentive plan includes a clawback provision that requires its executives and other participants to reimburse Eversource for incentive compensation received, not only if earnings are subsequently required to be restated as a result of noncompliance with accounting rules caused by fraud or misconduct, but also for a material violation of Eversource's Code of Business Conduct or material breach of a covenant in an employment agreement.  The Plan also imposes limits on awards and on compensation of Eversource Trustees and prohibits repricing of awards and liberal share recycling.

•

Eversource prohibits gross-ups in all new or materially amended executive compensation agreements.

•

Eversource has a "no hedging and no pledging" policy that prohibits the purchase of financial instruments or otherwise entering into any transactions that are designed to have the effect of hedging or offsetting any decrease in the market value of Eversource common shares.

•

Eversource's employment agreements and incentive plan require "double-trigger" change in control to accelerate compensation.

•

Eversource's Compensation Committee annually assesses the independence of its compensation consultant, Pay Governance LLC (Pay Governance), which is retained directly by the Committee.  Pay Governance performs no other consulting nor provides services for Eversource and has no relationship with Eversource that could result in a conflict of interest.  At its February 5, 2020 meeting, the Committee concluded that Pay Governance is independent and that no conflict of interest exists between Pay Governance and Eversource.

Overview of the Compensation Program

The Role of the Compensation Committee.

The Eversource Board of Trustees has delegated to the Compensation Committee overall responsibility for establishing the compensation program for those senior executive officers, whom are referred to in this CD&A as "executives" and whom are deemed to be "officers" under the SEC's regulations that determine the persons whose compensation is subject to disclosure.  In this role, the Committee sets compensation policy and compensation levels, reviews and approves performance goals and evaluates executive performance.  Although this CD&A refers principally to compensation for the Named Executive Officers, the same compensation principles and practices apply to all executives.  The compensation of Eversource's Chief Executive Officer is subject to the further review and approval of all of the independent Eversource Trustees.

Elements of Compensation

.

Total direct compensation consists of three elements: base salary, annual cash incentive awards and long-term equity-based incentive awards. Indirect compensation is provided through certain retirement, perquisite, severance, and health and welfare benefit programs.

Eversource's Compensation Objectives

.

The objectives of Eversource's compensation program are to attract and retain superior executive talent, motivate executives to achieve annual and long-term performance goals set each year, and provide total compensation opportunities that are competitive with market practices.  With respect to incentive compensation, the Committee believes it is important to balance short-term goals, such as producing earnings, with longer-term goals, such as long-term value creation for shareholders and maintaining a strong balance sheet.  The Committee also places great emphasis on operating performance and customer service.  Eversource's compensation program utilizes performance-based incentive compensation to reward individual and corporate performance and to align the interests of executives with Eversource Energy's customers and shareholders. The Committee continually increases expectations to motivate executives and employees to achieve continuous improvement in carrying out their responsibilities to customers to deliver energy and water reliably, safely, mindful of the environment and Eversource employees, and at a reasonable cost, while providing an above-average total return to Eversource shareholders.

Setting Compensation Levels

.

To ensure that Eversource achieves its goal of providing market-based total direct compensation levels to attract and retain top quality management, the Committee provides executives with target compensation opportunities approximately equal to median compensation levels for executive officers of companies in the utility industry comparable to Eversource in size.  To achieve that goal, the Committee and its independent compensation consultant work together to determine the market values of executive direct compensation elements (base salaries, annual incentives and long-term incentives), as well as total compensation, by using competitive market compensation data.  The Committee reviews competitive compensation data obtained from utility and general industry surveys and a specific group of peer utility companies.  Incumbent compensation levels may be set below the market median for those executives who are new to their roles, while long-tenured, high performing executives may be compensated above median.  The review by Pay Governance performed in late 2019 indicated that Eversource's aggregate executive compensation levels were aligned with median market rates.

Role of the Compensation Consultant.

The Committee has retained Pay Governance as its independent compensation consultant.  Pay Governance reports directly to the Committee and does not provide any other services to Eversource.  With the consent of the Committee, Pay Governance works cooperatively with Eversource's management to develop analyses and proposals for presentation to the Committee.  The Committee generally relies on Pay Governance for peer group market data and information as to market practices and trends to assess the competitiveness of the compensation Eversource pays to its executives and to review the Committee's proposed compensation decisions.

Pay Governance Independence.

In February 2020, the Committee assessed the independence of Pay Governance pursuant to SEC and NYSE rules, and concluded that it is independent and that no conflict of interest exists that would prevent Pay Governance from independently advising the Committee.  In making this assessment, the Committee considered the independence factors enumerated in Rule 10C-1(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the written representations of Pay Governance that Pay Governance does not provide any other services to Eversource, the level of fees received from Eversource as a percentage of Pay Governance's total revenues, the policies and procedures employed by Pay Governance to prevent conflicts of interest, and whether the individual Pay Governance advisers with whom the Committee consulted own any Eversource Energy common shares or have any business or personal relationships with members of the Committee or the Eversource executives.

Role of Management.

The role of Eversource's management, and specifically the roles of Eversource's Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President of Human Resources and Information Technology, are to provide current compensation information to the compensation consultant and analyses and recommendations on executive compensation to the Committee based on the market value of the position, individual performance, experience and internal pay equity.  Eversource's Chief Executive Officer also provides recommendations on the compensation for the other Eversource Named Executive Officers.  None of the executives makes recommendations that affect his or her individual compensation.


MARKET ANALYSIS

The Compensation Committee seeks to provide executives with target compensation opportunities using a range that is approximately equal to the median compensation levels for executive officers of utility companies comparable to Eversource.  Set forth below is a description of the sources of the compensation data used by the Committee when reviewing 2019 compensation:

•

Competitive compensation survey data

.  The Committee reviews compensation information obtained from surveys of diverse groups of utility and general industry companies that represent Eversource's market for executive officer talent. Utility industry data serve as the primary reference point for benchmarking officer compensation and are based on a defined peer set, as discussed below, while general industry data are derived from compensation consultant surveys and serve as a secondary reference point.  General industry data are used for staff positions and are size-adjusted to ensure a close correlation between the market data and Eversource's scope of operations.  The Committee references this information, which it obtains from Pay Governance, to evaluate and determine base salaries and incentive opportunities.

•

Peer group data.

In support of executive pay decisions, the Committee consulted with Pay Governance, which provided the Committee with a competitive assessment analysis of Eversource's executive compensation levels as compared to the 20 peer group companies listed in the table below.  This peer group was chosen because these companies are and continue to be similar to Eversource Energy in terms of size, business model and long-term strategies.

The Committee reviews the appropriateness of the peer group periodically and adjusts the target percentages of annual and long-term incentives based on the survey data and recommendations from Eversource's CEO, after discussion with the compensation consultant, to ensure that they are approximately equal to competitive median levels.

The Committee periodically reviews the general market for supplemental benefits and perquisites using utility and general industry survey data, including data obtained from companies in the peer group.

MIX OF COMPENSATION ELEMENTS

Eversource targets

the mix of compensation for its Chief Executive Officer and its other Named Executive Officers so that the percentages of each compensation element are approximately equal to the competitive median market mix.  The mix is heavily weighted toward incentive compensation, and incentive compensation is heavily weighted toward long-term compensation.  Since the most senior positions have the greatest responsibility for implementing the long-term business plans and strategies, a greater proportion of total compensation is based on performance with a long-term focus.

The Committee determines the compensation for each executive based on the relative authority, duties and responsibilities of the executive.  Eversource's Chief Executive Officer's responsibilities for the strategic direction and daily operations and management of Eversource are greater than the duties and responsibilities of the other executives.  As a result, Eversource's Chief Executive Officer's compensation is higher than the compensation of those other executives.  Assisted by the compensation consultant, the Committee regularly reviews market compensation data for executive officer positions similar to those held by Eversource's executives, including its Chief Executive Officer.


The following table sets forth the contribution to 2019 Total Direct Compensation (TDC) of each element of compensation at target, reflected as a percentage of TDC, for the Named Executive Officers.  The percentages shown in this table are at target and therefore do not correspond to the amounts appearing in the Summary Compensation Table.

(1)

The annual incentive compensation element and performance shares under the long-term incentive compensation element are performance-based.

(2)

Restricted Share Units (RSUs) vest over three years contingent upon continued employment.

Results of Eversource's 2019 Say-on-Pay Vote

.

Eversource provides its shareholders with the required opportunity to cast the annual advisory vote on executive compensation (a "Say-on-Pay" proposal).  At Eversource's Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on May 1, 2019, 88 percent of the votes cast on the Say-on-Pay proposal were voted to approve the 2018 compensation of the Named Executive Officers, as described in Eversource's 2019 proxy statement.   Eversource's Say-on-Pay results, along with utility and general industry peers, are reviewed by the Committee annually to help assess whether Eversource shareholders continue to deem the executives' compensation to be appropriate.  The Committee has and will continue to consider the outcome of Eversource's Say-on-Pay votes when making future compensation decisions for the Named Executive Officers.

ELEMENTS OF 2019 COMPENSATION

Base Salary

Base salary is designed to attract and retain key executives by providing an element of total compensation at levels competitive with those of other executives employed by companies of similar size and complexity in the utility and general industries. In establishing base salary, the Compensation Committee relies on compensation data obtained from independent third-party surveys of companies and from an industry peer group to ensure that the compensation opportunities Eversource offers are capable of attracting and retaining executives with the experience and talent required to achieve its strategic objectives.  Adjustments to base salaries are generally made on an annual basis except in instances of promotions.

When setting or adjusting base salaries, the Committee considers annual executive performance appraisals; market pay movement across industries (determined through market analysis); targeted market pay positioning for each executive; individual experience; strategic importance of a position; recommendations of Eversource's Chief Executive Officer; and internal pay equity.


Incentive Compensation

Annual incentive and long-term incentive compensation are provided under Eversource's 2018 Incentive Plan.  The annual incentive program provides cash compensation intended to reward performance under Eversource's annual operating plan. The long-term stock-based incentive program is designed to reward demonstrated performance and leadership, motivate future performance, align the interests of the executives with those of shareholders, and retain executives during the term of grants. The annual and long-term programs are designed to strike a balance between Eversource's short- and long-term objectives so that the programs work in tandem.

In addition to the specific performance goals, the Committee assesses other factors, as well as the executives' roles and individual performance and then makes annual incentive program awards at the levels and amounts disclosed in this CD&A.

RISK ANALYSIS OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM

The overall compensation program includes a mix of compensation elements ranging from a fixed base salary that is not at risk to annual and long-term incentive compensation programs intended to motivate executives and eligible employees to achieve individual and corporate performance goals that reflect an appropriate level of risk. The fundamental objective of the compensation program is to foster the continued growth and success of Eversource's business. The design and implementation of the overall compensation program provides the Committee with opportunities throughout the year to assess risks within the compensation program that may have a material effect on Eversource and its shareholders.

The Compensation Committee assesses the risks associated with the executive compensation program on an ongoing basis by reviewing the various elements of incentive compensation. The annual incentive program is designed to ensure an appropriate balance between individual and corporate goals, which were deemed appropriate and supportive of Eversource's annual business plan. Similarly, the long-term incentive program is designed to ensure that the performance metrics were properly weighted and supportive of Eversource's strategy. The Committee reviewed the overall compensation program in the context of risks identified in the annual operating plan. The annual and long-term incentive programs were designed to include mechanisms to mitigate risk. These mechanisms include realistic goal setting and discretion with respect to actual payments, in addition to:

•

A mix of annual and long-term performance awards to provide an appropriate balance of short- and long-term risk and reward horizon;

•

A variety of performance metrics, including financial, operational, customer service, ESG, diversity and safety goals and other strategic initiatives for annual performance awards to avoid excessive focus on a single measure of performance;

•

Metrics in Eversource's long-term incentive compensation program that use earnings per share growth and relative total shareholder return, which are both robust measures of shareholder value and which reduce the risk that employees might be encouraged to pursue other objectives that increase risk or reduce financial performance;

•

The provisions of Eversource's annual and long-term incentive programs, which cap awards at 200 percent of target;

•

Expansive clawback provisions on incentive compensation, including clawback for material violations of the Eversource Code of Business Conduct; and

•

Stock ownership requirements for all executives, including the Named Executive Officers, and prohibitions on hedging, pledging and other derivative transactions related to Eversource common shares.

Based on these factors, the Compensation Committee and Eversource's Board of Trustees believe the overall compensation program risks are mitigated to reduce overall compensation risk.

2019 ANNUAL INCENTIVE PROGRAM ASSESSMENT

In February 2019, the Committee established the terms of the 2019 Annual Incentive Program.  As part of the overall program, and after consulting with Pay Governance, the Committee set target award levels for each of the Named Executive Officers that ranged from 65 percent to 120 percent of base salary.

At the February 2019 meeting, the Committee determined that for 2019 it would continue to base 70 percent of the annual incentive performance goals on Eversource's overall financial performance and 30 percent of the annual performance goals on Eversource's overall operational performance. The Committee also determined the specific goals that would be used to assess performance, with potential ratings on each goal ranging from 0 percent to 200 percent of target. The Committee assigned weightings to each of these specific goals.  For the financial component, the following goals were used: earnings per share, weighted at 60 percent, dividend growth, weighted at 10 percent, and advancement of strategic growth initiatives and regulatory outcomes, weighted at 30 percent.  For the operational component, the Committee used the following goals: combined service reliability and restoration goals, weighted at 50 percent, and combined safety ratings, gas service response, diversity promotions and hires of leadership employee positions goals, and sustainability and customer and clean energy initiatives, weighted at 50 percent.


In establishing the individual annual performance goals, the Committee sets stretch goals for both the Financial and Operational goals, many of which do not represent threshold or target award goals, but require superior performance in order to be met.  As a result, achieving these goals will justify an assessment beyond the target amount that is set for computing results.

2019 Performance Goals

At the December 2019 meeting of the Committee, management provided an initial review of Eversource's 2019 performance, followed in February 2020 by a full assessment of the performance goals, the additional accomplishments noted below under the caption "Additional Factors" and the overall performance of Eversource and the executives. In addition to these meetings, the Committee and the Eversource Board were provided updates during 2019 on corporate performance.  At the February 5, 2020 meeting, the Committee determined, based on its assessment of the financial and operational performance goals, to set the level of achievement of combined financial and operational performance goals results at 188 percent, reflecting the exceptionally strong performance of Eversource and the executive team.  In arriving at this determination, the Committee determined that the financial performance goals result was 185 percent and the operational performance goals result was 192 percent.  Eversource's Chief Executive Officer recommended to the Committee awards for the executives (other than himself) based on his assessment of each executive's individual performance towards achievement of the performance goals and the additional accomplishments of Eversource, together with each executive's contributions to the overall performance of Eversource.  The actual awards determined by the Committee were also based on the same criteria.

Financial Performance Goals Assessment

•

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE:

Eversource's non-GAAP earnings per share in 2019, which excludes the NPT impairment charge, increased by 6.2 percent when compared to GAAP earnings per share in 2018, and exceeded the established goal of $3.42. Eversource was able to achieve earnings through effective management of the 2019 operating plan on a day by day basis and by overcoming several challenges to plan achievement, including higher than plan operation and maintenance storm restoration expenses and the impact of the dilution of a very successful equity issuance.

The Committee discussed at length the earnings per share goal, and to what extent the NPT impairment charge, which reduced GAAP earnings by $0.64 per share, should affect the earnings goal assessment.  This discussion included consideration of the nature, timing, cause, mitigation and overall effect of the impairment charge on Eversource’s 2019 financial performance.  The Committee determined the earnings per share goal to have attained a 180 percent performance result.


•

DIVIDENDS PAID:

Eversource increased its dividend to $2.14 per share, a 5.9 percent increase from the prior year, significantly above the utility industry's median dividend growth of 5.1 percent.  The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 170 percent performance result.

•

CLEAN ENERGY:

Eversource advanced its strategic growth initiatives in 2019.  Eversource expanded the offshore wind partnership with Ørsted, the global leader of offshore wind development, through the acquisition of the Northeast U.S. assets of Deepwater Wind.  The partnership with Ørsted successfully bid into the New York clean energy request for proposal and was awarded a contract for 880 megawatts of offshore wind power with the Sunrise Wind project, and the partnership advanced the New London State Pier agreement to support offshore wind construction.  The 1,714 megawatts that the partnership has under contract makes the Eversource/Ørsted partnership the largest developer of offshore wind in North America.  Eversource accelerated the original five-year electric vehicle charging program in Massachusetts to three years, and the program met its 2019 targets, and Eversource commenced the construction process on two energy storage projects in Massachusetts.  These projects will substantially improve system reliability with innovative clean energy solutions.  The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 200 percent performance result.

Operational Performance Goals Assessment

•

RELIABILITY PERFORMANCE:

Eversource's total electric system reliability performance significantly exceeded that of its peers and was Eversource's best performance ever.  Average months between interruptions equaled 21.6 months, significantly exceeding the performance zone established by the Committee.  Eversource's results are in the top decile of industry peers.  The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 200 percent performance result.


•

RESTORATION PERFORMANCE:

System average restoration duration time equaled 59.2 minutes, also significantly exceeding the performance zone established by the Committee and also reflecting Eversource's best year ever and top decile performance in the industry.  The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 200 percent performance result.

•

SAFETY:

Eversource achieved the safety performance goal of between 0.5 and 0.9 DART per 100 employees; DART equaled 0.7 in 2019, within the goal's established performance zone and better than its peers.  The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 150 percent performance result.

•

GAS EMERGENCY RESPONSE:

On-time response to gas customer emergency calls was 99.7 percent, which exceeded the goal's upper range performance zone of 99.2 percent to 99.6 percent.  The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 200 percent performance result.


•

DIVERSITY:

In 2019, 41 percent of new Eversource hires and promotions into leadership roles were women or people of color, exceeding the goal of 40 percent.  The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 175 percent performance result.

•

SUSTAINABILITY:

Eversource established a new goal in 2019, which was to be in the 75th percentile of a peer group of comparably sized U.S. utilities whose ESG performance is assessed by the two leading sustainability rating firms.    Eversource's average score ranked in the top decile of the peer group.  The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 200 percent performance result.

•

CUSTOMER:

Eversource continued its programs to transform the Eversource customer experience, launching a new mobile app, improving the accuracy of estimated time of service restoration during outages to 92 percent, and increasing digital customer interaction to 85.4 percent, all of which had a positive impact on customer satisfaction.  The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 175 percent performance result.

•

CLEAN ENERGY:

In addition to the significant progress in offshore wind, Eversource's electric vehicle charging program met its 2019 goal, condensing its five-year implementation to three years and advancing two energy storage projects.  Eversource also maintained its energy efficiency status as the leading energy efficiency provider in the nation per the American Council for Energy Efficient Economy.  The Committee determined this goal to have attained a 200 percent performance result.

•

Eversource's 2019 charitable giving totaled $18.3 million, including major event lead sponsorships for the Eversource Walk for Children's Hospital, Eversource Walk and 5K Run for Easterseals New Hampshire, Mass General Cancer Center/Eversource Every Day Amazing Race, Eversource Hartford Marathon, Travelers Championship, and the Special Olympics in Connecticut and New Hampshire.

Individual Executives' Performance Factors Considered by the Committee

It is the Committee's philosophy to provide incentives for Eversource executives to work together as a highly effective, integrated team to achieve or exceed the financial, operational, safety, customer, sustainability, strategic and diversity goals and objectives.  The Committee also reviews and assesses individual executive performance.  The Committee based the annual incentive payments on team performance and the Committee's assessment of each executive's individual performance in supporting the performance goals, additional achievements, and Eversource's overall performance.  With respect to Eversource's Chief Executive Officer, the Committee and all other independent Eversource Trustees assessed the performance of the Chief Executive Officer. Based on the recommendations of the Chief Executive Officer as to executives other than himself, the Committee assessed the performance of the Named Executive Officers to determine the individual incentive payments as disclosed in the Summary Compensation Table.  Based on the Committee's review, which included its assessment of the performance goals, the significant other accomplishments of Eversource, and the overall performance of Eversource and each of the Named Executive Officers, considered in its totality by the Committee to have been superior, the Committee approved annual incentive program payments for the Named Executive Officers at levels that ranged from 175 percent to 200 percent of target.  These payments reflected the individual and team contributions of the Named Executive Officers in achieving the goals and the additional accomplishments and Eversource's overall performance.

In determining Mr. Judge's annual incentive payment of $3,000,000, which was 188 percent of target and which reflects his and Eversource's transformational 2019 performance, the Committee and the Board considered the totality of Eversource's success in accomplishing the goals set by the Committee, the additional accomplishments of Eversource, and the superior leadership of Mr. Judge in continuing to both challenge the Eversource workforce to be broadly recognized as the best energy company in the nation by 2020 and leading Eversource in meeting  that challenge.

Long-Term Incentive Program

General

Eversource's long-term incentive program is intended to focus on Eversource's longer-term strategic goals and to help retain its executives.  A new three-year program commences every year.  For the three programs described below, each executive's target long-term incentive opportunity consisted of 50 percent Performance Shares and 50 percent RSUs.  For the 2021 - 2023 Program and as set forth below, the target opportunity will consist of 75 percent Performance Shares and 25 percent RSUs.  Performance Shares are designed to reward long-term achievements as measured against pre-established performance measures.  RSUs are designed to provide executives with an incentive to increase the value of Eversource common shares in alignment with shareholder interests, while also serving as a retention component for executive talent.  Eversource believes these compensation elements create a focus on continued Eversource and share price growth to further align the interests of Eversource's executives with the interests of Eversource's shareholders.

Performance Share Grants

General

Performance Shares are designed to reward future financial performance, measured by long-term earnings growth and shareholder returns over a three-year performance period, therefore aligning management compensation with performance.  Performance Shares are granted as a target number of Eversource common shares.  The number of Performance Shares is determined by dividing the target grant value in dollars by the average daily closing prices of Eversource common shares on the New York Stock Exchange for the ten business days preceding the grant date and rounding to the nearest whole share.  Until the end of the performance period, the value of dividends that would have been paid with respect to the Performance Shares had the Performance Shares been actual common shares will be deemed to be invested in additional Performance Shares, which remain at risk and do not vest until actual performance for the period is determined.


Performance Shares under the 2018 - 2020 and 2019 - 2021 Programs

For the 2019 - 2021 Program, the Committee determined it would measure performance using: (i) average diluted earnings per share growth (EPSG); and (ii) relative total shareholder return (TSR) measured against the performance of companies that comprise the EEI Index.  As in 2018 and 2017, the Committee selected EPSG and TSR as performance measures because the Committee continues to believe that they are generally recognized as the best indicators of overall corporate performance.   Further, the Committee considers it a best practice to use a combination of relative and absolute metrics, with absolute EPS growth serving as a key input to shareholder value and relative TSR serving as the output.

The number of Performance Shares awarded at the end of the three-year period ranges from 0 percent to 200 percent of target, depending on EPSG and relative TSR performance as set forth in the performance matrix below.  Performance Share grants are based on a percentage of annualized base salary at the time of the grant and measured in dollars.  The target number of shares under the 2019 - 2021 Program ranged from 35 percent to 233 percent of base salary.  EPSG ranges from 0 percent to 9 percent, while TSR ranges from below the 10th percentile to above the 90th percentile.  The target award is 100 percent, which the Committee determined is challenging but achievable.  As a result, vesting at 100 percent of target occurs at various combinations of EPSG and TSR performance.  In addition, the value of any performance shares that actually vest may increase or decrease over the vesting period based on Eversource's share price performance.  The number of performance shares granted at target were approved as set forth in the table below.  The Committee and the independent members of the Eversource Board determined the Performance Share grants for Eversource's Chief Executive Officer.  Based on input from the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee determined the Performance Share grants for each of the other executive officers, including the other Named Executive Officers.

For the 2018 - 2020 Program, the Committee used the same performance measures of EPSG and TSR and the same criteria used in the 2019 - 2021 Program described above.

The performance matrix set forth below describes how the Performance Share payout will be determined under the 2018 - 2020 and 2019 - 2021 Long-Term Incentive Programs and how the Performance Share payout was determined under the 2017 - 2019 Program.  Three-year average EPSG is cross-referenced with the actual three-year TSR percentile to determine actual performance share payout as a percentage of target:

Long-Term Incentive Program Performance Share Grants at Target

Results of the 2017 - 2019 Performance Share Program

The 2017 - 2019 Program, which used the same criteria used in the 2019 - 2021 Program described above, was completed on December 31, 2019.  The actual performance level achieved under the Program was a three-year average adjusted EPS growth of 5.3 percent and a three-year total shareholder return at the 87th percentile, which when interpolated in accordance with the criteria established by the Committee in 2017 resulted in vesting performance share units at 150 percent of target.  2019 non-GAAP earnings per share, which exclude the NPT impairment charge, were the basis for performance level assessment.  At its February 5, 2020 meeting, the Committee confirmed that the actual results achieved were calculated in accordance with established performance criteria. The number of Performance Shares awarded to the Named Executive Officers were approved as set forth in the table below.


The 2020 - 2022 and 2021 - 2023 Performance Share Programs

The Compensation Committee determined that for the 2020 - 2022 Program adjustments to the measurement criteria would be put into place increasing the level of performance required to reach a target (100 percent) grant award and adding additional performance levels for which no award of shares would be made.  The Committee also determined that the 2021 - 2023 Performance Share Program will change such that 75 percent of the long-term incentive opportunity will consist of Performance Shares and 25 percent will consist of RSUs.

Restricted Share Units (RSUs)

General

Each RSU granted under the long-term incentive program entitles the holder to receive one Eversource common share at the time of vesting.  All RSUs granted under the long-term incentive program vest in equal annual installments over three years.  RSU holders are eligible to receive reinvested dividend units on outstanding RSUs held by them to the same extent that dividends are declared and paid on Eversource common shares.  Reinvested dividend equivalents are accounted for as additional RSUs that accrue and are distributed with the common shares issued upon vesting of the underlying RSUs.  Common shares, including any additional common shares in respect of reinvested dividend equivalents, are not issued for any RSUs that do not vest.

The Committee determined RSU grants for each executive officer participating in the long-term incentive program.  RSU grants are based on a percentage of annualized base salary at the time of the grant.  In 2019, the percentage used for each executive officer was based on the executive officer's position in Eversource and ranged from 40 percent to 238 percent of base salary.  The Committee reserves the right to increase or decrease the RSU grant from target for each officer under special circumstances.  The Committee and all other independent members of the Eversource Board determined the RSU grants for Eversource's Chief Executive Officer. Based on input from the Chief Executive Officer, the Committee determined the RSU grants for each of the other executive officers, including the other Named Executive Officers.

All RSUs are granted on the date of the Committee meeting at which they are approved. RSU grants are subsequently converted from a percent of salary into Eversource common share equivalents by dividing the value of each grant by the average closing price for Eversource common shares over the ten trading days prior to the date of the grant.  RSU grants at 100 percent of target were approved as set forth in the table below.

Clawbacks

If Eversource's earnings were to be restated as a result of noncompliance with accounting rules caused by fraud or misconduct, or if a plan participant engages in a willful material violation of Eversource's Code of Business Conduct or material corporate policy, or the breach of a material covenant in an employment agreement, as determined by the Eversource Board of Trustees, the participant will be required by the Eversource 2018 Incentive Plan to reimburse Eversource for incentive compensation awards received by them for that year.


No Hedging and No Pledging Policy

Eversource has a long-standing policy prohibiting the purchase of any financial instruments or otherwise entering into transactions designed to have the effect of hedging or offsetting any decrease in the value of Eversource common shares or other Eversource equity securities or its subsidiaries by Eversource Trustees and executives, including exchange-traded options to purchase or sell Eversource securities (so-called "puts" and "calls") or financial instruments that are designed to hedge or offset any decrease in the market value of Eversource securities (including, but not limited to, prepaid variable forward contracts, equity swaps, collars and exchange funds).  This policy also prohibits short sales, the holding of any Eversource common shares in a margin account, borrowing shares, selling future securities that establish a position that increases in value as the value of Eversource common shares decreases, or pledging Eversource's common shares.  The policy applies to Trustees and executives but not to non-executives and does not apply to broad-based index funds or similar transactions.

Share Ownership Guidelines and Retention Requirements

The Committee has approved share ownership guidelines to further emphasize the importance of share ownership by Eversource officers.  As indicated in the table below, the guidelines call for Eversource's Chief Executive Officer to own common shares equal to six times base salary, executive vice presidents to own a number of common shares equal to three times base salary, senior vice presidents to own common shares equal to two times base salary, and all other officers to own a number of common shares equal to one to one and one half times base salary.  Officers and Eversource Trustees may only transact in Eversource common shares during approved trading windows and subject to continuing compliance with these share ownership guidelines.

Eversource requires that its officers attain these ownership levels within five years.  All Eversource officers, including Eversource's Named Executive Officers, have satisfied the share ownership guidelines or are expected to satisfy them within the applicable timeframe.  Common shares, whether held of record, in street name, or in individual 401(k) accounts, and RSUs satisfy the guideline requirements to hold 100 percent of the net shares.  Unvested performance shares do not count toward the ownership guidelines.  In addition to the share ownership guidelines noted above, all officers must hold all the shares awarded under Eversource's incentive compensation plan until the share ownership guidelines have been met.

Other Benefits

Retirement Benefits

Eversource provides a qualified defined benefit pension program for certain officers, which is a final average pay program subject to tax code limits.  Because of such limits, Eversource also maintain a supplemental non-qualified pension program. Benefits are based on base salary and certain incentive payments, which is consistent with the goal of providing a retirement benefit that replaces a percentage of pre-retirement income.  The supplemental program compensates for benefits barred by tax code limits, and generally provides (together with the qualified pension program) benefits equal to approximately 60 percent of pre-retirement compensation (subject to certain reductions) for Messrs.  Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan, and approximately 50 percent of such compensation for Mr. Butler.  The supplemental program has been discontinued for newly-elected officers.

For certain participants, the benefits payable under the Supplemental Non-Qualified Pension Program differ from those described above. The program benefit payable to Mr. Schweiger is fully vested and is further reduced by benefits he is entitled to receive under previous employers' retirement plans.

Also see the narrative accompanying the "Pension Benefits" table and accompanying notes for more detail on the above program.

Mr. Judge's Pension Benefit

As an employee for more than 40 years, Mr. Judge's employee benefits include a pension benefit.  Mr. Judge was elected to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer in 2016, such that 2017 was the first year that he served in his new position at the higher CEO compensation level.  Since then there have been substantial increases over the past three years in the actuarial, formula-based present values of his pension benefit.  These increases are disclosed in the Change in Pension Value and Non-Qualified Deferred Earnings column of the Summary Compensation Table.  The methodology that is used to calculate the change in pension value is based upon applicable accounting rules and is influenced up or down by external values, such as assumptions regarding life expectancy and changes in the discount rate determined each year.  These variables are functions of factors that do not relate to Eversource and executive performance, are outside the control of the Committee, and may or may not impact the amounts that will actually be paid, as such variables and assumptions may change from time to time.  The calculation of Pension Value is very sensitive to interest rate levels.  Recent very low interest rates have resulted in a very low discount rate and is a major reason for the large increase in Mr. Judge's Change in Pension Value.  The accounting-based increase for Mr. Judge, while


representing a substantial portion of his 2017, 2018 and 2019 total compensation disclosed in the SEC Total column of the Summary Compensation Table, resulted in no actual 2017 to 2019 W-2 earnings for him.

401(k) Benefits

Eversource offers a qualified 401(k) program for all employees, including executives, subject to tax code limits.  After applying these limits, the program provides a match of 50 percent of the first 8 percent of eligible base salary, up to a maximum of $11,200 per year for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan.  For Mr. Butler, the program provides a match of 100 percent of the first 3 percent of eligible base salary, up to a maximum of $8,400 per year.

Deferred Compensation

Eversource offers a non-qualified deferred compensation program for its executives.  In 2019, the program allowed deferral of up to 100 percent of base salary, annual incentives and long-term incentive awards.  The program allows participants to select investment measures for deferrals based on an array of deemed investment options (including certain mutual funds and publicly traded securities).

See the Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Table and accompanying notes for additional details on the above program.

Perquisites

Eversource provides executives with limited financial planning benefits, vehicle leasing and access to tickets to sporting events.  The current level of perquisites does not factor into decisions on total compensation.

Contractual Agreements

Eversource maintains contractual agreements with all of its Named Executive Officers that provide for potential compensation in the event of certain terminations, including termination following a Change in Control.  Eversource believes these agreements are necessary to attract and retain high quality executives and to ensure executive focus on Eversource business during the period leading up to a potential Change in Control.  The agreements are "double-trigger" agreements that provide executives with compensation in the event of a Change in Control followed by termination of employment due to one or more of the events set forth in the agreements, while still providing an incentive to remain employed with Eversource for the transition period that follows.

Under the agreements, certain compensation is generally payable if, during the applicable change in control period, the executive is involuntarily terminated (other than for cause) or terminates employment for "good reason."  These agreements are described more fully in the tables following this CD&A under "Payments Upon Termination."  Eversource has not entered into a Change in Control agreement with any executive since 2010.

Tax and Accounting Considerations

Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code precludes a public corporation from taking an income tax deduction in any one year for compensation in excess of $1 million payable to its Named Executive Officers who are employed on the last day of the fiscal year, unless certain specific performance goals are satisfied.  Until January 1, 2018, there was an exception to the $1 million limitation for performance-based compensation meeting certain requirements.  This exception was repealed, effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, and the limitation on deductibility generally was expanded to include all Named Executive Officers.  As a result, compensation paid to the Named Executive Officers in excess of $1 million per officer will not be deductible unless it qualifies for transition relief applicable to certain arrangements in place as of and not modified after November 2, 2017.

The Committee believes that the availability of a tax deduction for forms of compensation should be one of many factors taken into consideration of providing market-based compensation to attract and retain highly qualified executives.  The Committee believes it is in Eversource's best interests to retain discretion to make compensation awards, whether or not deductible.

Eversource has adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718,

Compensation-Stock Compensation

.  In general, Eversource and the Committee do not consider accounting considerations in structuring compensation arrangements.

Equity Grant Practices

Equity awards noted in the compensation tables are made annually at the February meeting of the Compensation Committee (subject to further approval by all of the independent members of Eversource's Board of Trustees of Eversource's Chief Executive Officer's award) when the Committee also determines base salary, annual incentive opportunities, long-term incentive compensation targets, and annual and long-term performance plan awards. The date of this meeting is chosen at least a year in advance, and therefore awards are not coordinated with the release of material non-public information.


SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE

The table below summarizes the total compensation paid or earned by CL&P's principal executive officer (Mr. Judge), principal financial officer (Mr. Lembo) and the three other most highly compensated executive officers in 2019, determined in accordance with the applicable SEC disclosure rules (collectively, the Named Executive Officers). As explained in the footnotes below, the amounts reflect the economic benefit to each Named Executive Officer of the compensation item paid or accrued on behalf of the Named Executive Officers for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 in accordance with such rules.  All salaries, annual incentive amounts and long-term incentive amounts shown for each Named Executive Officer were paid for all services rendered to Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries, including CL&P, in all capacities.

(1)

Reflects the aggregate grant date fair value of restricted share units (RSUs) and performance shares granted in each fiscal year, calculated in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718.

RSUs were granted to each Named Executive Officer in 2019 as long-term compensation, which vest in equal annual installments over three years.  In 2019, each of the Named Executive Officers was also granted performance shares as long-term incentive compensation.  These performance shares will vest based on the extent to which the two performance conditions described in the CD&A are achieved as of December 31, 2021.  The grant date fair values for the performance shares, assuming achievement of the highest level of both performance conditions, are as follows:  Mr. Judge: $5,080,453; Mr. Lembo: $1,109,815; Mr. Schweiger: $1,109,815; Mr. Butler: $914,831; and Mr. Nolan: $837,387.

Holders of RSUs and performance shares are eligible to receive dividend equivalent units on outstanding awards to the same extent that dividends are declared and paid on Eversource common shares. Dividend equivalent units are accounted for as additional common shares that accrue and are distributed simultaneously with those common shares that are issued upon vesting of the underlying RSUs and performance shares.  No dividends are paid unless and until the underlying shares vest.

(2)

Includes payments to the Named Executive Officers under the 2019 Annual Incentive Program: Mr. Judge: $3,000,000; Mr. Lembo: $1,000,000; Mr. Schweiger: $1,050,000; Mr. Butler: $740,000; and Mr. Nolan: $774,000.

(3)

Includes the actuarial increase in the present value from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019 of the Named Executive Officers' accumulated benefits under all of the defined benefit pension programs and agreements, determined using interest rate and mortality rate assumptions consistent with those appearing in the footnotes to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.  The Named Executive Officer may not be fully vested in such amounts.  More information on this topic is set forth in the Pension Benefits table.  There were no above-market earnings in deferred compensation value during 2019, as the terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan provide for market-based investments, including Eversource common shares.  Mr. Judge was elected to the position of President and Chief Executive Officer of Eversource Energy in 2016, such that 2017 was the first year that he served in his more highly compensated position.  This has resulted in substantial increases in the actuarial present value of his pension benefits.  These accounting-based increases, while representing for Mr. Judge a substantial portion of his 2017 - 2019 total compensation disclosed in the SEC Total above, resulted in no actual W-2 earnings for him for these years.

(4)

Includes matching contributions allocated by Eversource to the accounts of Named Executive Officers under the 401k Plan as follows:  $11,200 for each of Messrs. Judge, Lembo and Schweiger and Nolan, and $8,400 for Mr. Butler.  For Mr. Judge, the value shown includes financial planning services valued at $5,000 and $10,357

paid by Eversource for a company-leased vehicle.  For Mr. Schweiger, the value shown includes financial planning services valued at $5,000 and $5,646 paid by Eversource representing the value in 2019 of a company-owned vehicle provided to Mr. Schweiger.  None of the other Named Executive Officers received perquisites valued in the aggregate in excess of $10,000.


(5)

The amounts in the Adjusted SEC Total column reflect an adjustment to the total compensation reported in the column marked SEC Total.  The Adjusted SEC Total subtracts the actuarial change in pension value disclosed in the column titled "Change in Pension Value and Non-Qualified Deferred Earnings" as further described in footnote 4 above in order to reflect compensation earned during the year by the executive without consideration of pension benefit impacts.  The amounts in this column differ substantially from, and are not a substitute for, the amounts noted in the SEC Total.

GRANTS OF PLAN-BASED AWARDS DURING 2019

The Grants of Plan-Based Awards table below provides information on the range of potential payouts under all incentive plan awards during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.  The table also discloses the underlying equity awards and the grant date for equity-based awards.  Eversource has not granted any stock options since 2002.

(1)

Reflects the number of performance shares granted to each of the Named Executive Officers on February 6, 2019 under the 2019 - 2021 Long-Term Incentive Program.  Performance shares were granted subject to a three-year Performance Period that ends on December 31, 2021.  At the end of the Performance Period, Eversource common shares will be awarded based on actual performance results as a percentage of target, subject to reduction for applicable payroll withholding taxes.  Holders of performance shares are eligible to receive dividend equivalent units on outstanding performance shares awarded to them to the same extent that dividends are declared and paid on Eversource common shares.  Dividend equivalent units are accounted for as additional common shares that accrue and are distributed simultaneously with the number of common shares underlying the performance shares that are actually awarded.  The Annual Incentive Program did not include an equity component.

(2)

Reflects the number of RSUs granted to each of the Named Executive Officers on February 6, 2019 under the 2019 - 2021 Long-Term Incentive Program.  RSUs vest in equal installments on February 6, 2020, 2021 and 2022.  Eversource common shares will be distributed with respect to vested RSUs on a one-for-one basis following vesting, after reduction for applicable payroll withholding taxes.  Holders of RSUs are eligible to receive dividend equivalent units on outstanding RSUs awarded to them to the same extent that dividends are declared and paid on Eversource common shares.  Dividend equivalent units are accounted for as additional common shares that accrue and are distributed simultaneously with those common shares actually distributed in respect of the underlying RSUs.

(3)

Reflects the grant date fair value, determined in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, of RSUs and performance shares granted to the Named Executive Officers on February 6, 2019 under the 2019 - 2021 Long-Term Incentive Program.

(4)

The threshold payment under the Annual Incentive Program is 50% of target.  The actual payments in 2020 for performance in 2019 are set forth in the Non-Equity Incentive Plan column of the Summary Compensation Table.

Reflects the range of potential payouts, if any, pursuant to performance share awards under the 2019 - 2021 Long-Term Incentive Program, as described in the CD&A.


OUTSTANDING EQUITY GRANTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2019

The following table sets forth RSU and performance share grants outstanding at the end of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 for each of the Named Executive Officers.  There are no outstanding options.

(1)

Awards and market values of awards appearing in the table and the accompanying notes have been rounded to whole units.

(2)

A total of 91,173 unvested RSUs will vest on February 6, 2020 (Mr. Judge: 50,777; Mr. Lembo: 11,447; Mr. Schweiger:  11,572; Mr. Butler: 9,135; and Mr. Nolan: 8,242). A total of 58,874 unvested RSUs will vest on February 8, 2021 (Mr. Judge: 33,153; Mr. Lembo: 7,242, Mr. Schweiger: 7,299; Mr. Butler: 5,830; and Mr. Nolan: 5,350).  A total of 28,223 unvested RSUs will vest on February 7, 2022 (Mr. Judge: 15,840; Mr. Lembo: 3,460; Mr. Schweiger: 3,460; Mr. Butler: 2,852; and Mr. Nolan: 2,611).

(3)

The market value of RSUs is determined by multiplying the number of RSUs by $85.07, the closing price of Eversource Energy common shares on December 31, 2019, the last trading day of the year.

(4)

Reflects the target payout level for performance shares granted under the 2017 - 2019 Program, the 2018 - 2020 Program and the 2019 - 2021 Program.

The performance period for the 2017 - 2019 Program ended on December 31, 2019.  Awards under that program are set forth in the CD&A under the "Results of the 2017 - 2019 Performance Share Program."

The performance share award for 2018 - 2020 Program and the 2019 - 2021 Program will be based on actual performance results as a percentage of target, subject to reduction for applicable payroll withholding taxes.  As described more fully under "Performance Shares" in the CD&A and footnote (1) to the Grants of Plan-Based Awards table, performance shares will vest following a three-year performance period based on the extent to which the two performance conditions are achieved. Under the 2018 - 2020 Program, a total of 91,949 unearned performance shares (including accrued dividend equivalents) will vest based on the extent to which the two performance conditions described in the CD&A are achieved as of December 31, 2020, assuming achievement of these conditions at a target level of performance: Mr. Judge: 51,941; Mr. Lembo: 11,344; Mr. Schweiger: 11,517; Mr. Butler: 8,931; and Mr. Nolan: 8,216.  Under the 2019 - 2021 Program, a total of 84,666 unearned performance shares (including accrued dividend equivalents) will vest based on the extent to which the two performance conditions described in the CD&A are achieved as of December 31, 2021.  Assuming achievement of these conditions at a target level of performance, the amount of the awards would be as follows: Mr. Judge: 47,518; Mr. Lembo: 10,380; Mr. Schweiger: 10,380; Mr. Butler: 8,556; and Mr. Nolan: 7,832.

(5)

The market value is determined by multiplying the number of performance shares in the adjacent column by $85.07, the closing price of Eversource Energy common shares on December 31, 2019, the last trading day of the year.

OPTION EXERCISES AND STOCK VESTED IN 2019

The following table reports amounts realized on equity compensation during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.  The Stock Awards columns report the vesting of RSU and performance share grants to the Named Executive Officers in 2019.

(1)

Includes RSUs and performance shares granted to the Named Executive Officers under the long-term incentive programs, including dividend reinvestment, as follows:


In all cases, the distribution of common shares is reduced by that number of shares valued in an amount sufficient to satisfy tax withholding obligations.

(2)

Values realized on vesting of RSUs granted under the 2016 - 2018, 2017 - 2019 and 2018 - 2020 Programs were based on $70.10 per share, the closing price of Eversource Energy common shares on February 14, 2019.  Values realized on vesting of performance shares granted under the 2016 - 2018 Program were based on $70.27 per share, the closing price of Eversource Energy common shares on February 20, 2019.

PENSION BENEFITS IN 2019

The Pension Benefits Table shows the estimated present value of accumulated retirement benefits payable to each Named Executive Officer upon retirement based on the assumptions described below.  The table distinguishes between benefits available under the qualified pension program, the supplemental pension program, and any additional benefits available under contractual agreements.  See the narrative above in the CD&A under the captions "Summary Compensation Table Versus Realized Pay Comparison - James J. Judge-Eversource CEO," "Other Benefits - Retirement Benefits" and "Contractual Agreements" for more detail on benefits under these plans and agreements.

The values shown in the Pension Benefits Table for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan were calculated as of December 31, 2019, based on benefit payments in the form of a lump sum.  For Mr. Butler, a payment of benefits was assumed in the form of a contingent annuitant option.  Such earned pension program benefit value could otherwise have changed because of the reduction in mortality factors and potentially rising interest rates.

The values shown in this Table for the Named Executive Officers were based on benefit payments on the actual ages or the earliest possible ages for retirement with unreduced benefits:  Mr. Judge: age 60; Mr. Lembo: age 62; Mr. Schweiger: age 55; Mr. Butler: age 62; and Mr. Nolan: age 62.

In addition, benefits were determined under the qualified pension program using tax code limits in effect on December 31, 2019.  For Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan, the values shown reflect actual 2019 salary and annual incentives earned in 2018 but paid in 2019 (per applicable supplemental program rules).  For Mr. Butler, the values shown reflect actual 2019 salary and annual incentives earned in 2019 but paid in 2020 (per applicable supplemental program rules).

Eversource determined the present value of benefits at retirement age using the discount rate within a range of 3.04% to 3.21% under ACS 715-30 pension accounting for the 2019 fiscal year end measurement as of December 31, 2019.  This present value assumes no pre-retirement mortality, turnover or disability.  However, for the postretirement period beginning at retirement age, the 2019 IRS lump sum mortality table was used for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan.  The RP2014 Employee Table Projected Generationally with Scale MP2019 was used for Mr. Butler.  This new mortality table (as published by the Society of Actuaries in 2014) and projection scale were used by the Eversource Pension Plan for year-end 2019 financial disclosure. Additional assumptions appear in the footnotes to the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.


Pension Benefits

NONQUALIFIED DEFERRED COMPENSATION IN 2019

The following table reports amounts contributed in 2019, together with aggregate earnings on contributions and withdrawals or distributions on contributions in 2019, under Eversource's deferred compensation program, along with aggregate balances on contributions.  See the narrative above in the CD&A under the caption "Other Benefits - Deferred Compensation" for more detail on the non-qualified deferred compensation program.

(1)

Includes the total market value of deferred compensation program balances at December 31, 2019, plus the value of vested RSUs or other awards for which the distribution of common shares is currently deferred, based on $85.07, the closing price of Eversource common shares on December 31, 2019, the last trading day of the year.  The aggregate balances reflect a significant level of earnings on previously earned and deferred compensation.

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL

The discussion and tables below show compensation payable to each Named Executive Officer who is still an employee of Eversource, in the event of: (i) voluntary termination; (ii) involuntary not-for-cause termination; (iii) termination in the event of death or disability; and (iv) termination following a change in control.  No amounts are payable in the event of a termination for cause.  The amounts shown assume that each termination was effective as of December 31, 2019, the last business day of the fiscal year.

Generally, a "change in control" means a change in ownership or control effected through (i) the acquisition of 30 percent or more of the combined voting power of common shares or other voting securities (20 percent for Mr. Butler, excluding certain defined transactions); (ii) the acquisition of more than 50 percent of Eversource common shares, excluding certain defined transactions (for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan); (iii) a change in the majority of the Eversource Board of Trustees, unless approved by a majority of the incumbent Trustees; (iv) certain reorganizations, mergers or consolidations where substantially all of the persons who were the beneficial owners of the outstanding common shares immediately prior to such business combination do not beneficially own more than 50 percent of the voting power of the resulting business entity (excluding in certain cases defined transactions); and (v) complete liquidation or dissolution of Eversource, or a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of Eversource other than, for Mr. Butler, to an entity with respect to which following completion of the transaction more than 50 percent of common shares or other voting securities is then owned by all or substantially all of the persons who were the beneficial owners of common shares and other voting securities immediately prior to such transaction.

In the event of a change in control, the Named Executive Officers are generally entitled to receive compensation and benefits following either involuntary termination of employment without "cause" or voluntary termination of employment for "good reason" within the applicable period (generally two years following a change in control). The Committee believes that termination for good reason is conceptually the same as termination "without cause" and, in the absence of this provision, potential acquirers would have an incentive to constructively terminate executives to avoid paying severance.  Termination for "cause" generally means termination due to a felony or certain other convictions; fraud, embezzlement, or theft in the course of employment; intentional, wrongful damage to Eversource property; gross misconduct or gross negligence in the course of employment or gross neglect of duties harmful to Eversource; or a material breach of obligations under the


agreement.  "Good reason" for termination generally exists after assignment of duties inconsistent with executive's position, a material reduction in compensation or benefits, a transfer more than 50 miles from the executive's pre-change in control principal business location (or for Messrs. Judge, Lembo, Schweiger and Nolan, an involuntary transfer outside the Greater Boston Metropolitan Area), or requiring business travel to a substantially greater extent than required prior to the change in control.

The summaries above do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by the actual terms and provisions of the agreements and plans, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Payments Upon Termination

Regardless of the manner in which the employment of a Named Executive Officer terminates, the executive is entitled to receive certain amounts earned during the executive's term of employment.  Such amounts include:

•

Vested RSUs and certain other vested awards;

•

Amounts contributed and any vested matching contributions under the deferred compensation program;

•

Pay for unused vacation; and

•

Amounts accrued and vested under the pension/supplemental and 401k programs (except in the event of a termination for cause under the supplemental program).

The following table describes additional compensation payable to the Named Executive Officers in the event of voluntary termination, involuntary termination not for cause, termination in the event of death or disability and termination following a change in control.  No benefits are provided in the event of termination for cause.  See the section above captioned "Pension Benefits in 2019" for information about the pension program, supplemental program and other benefits, and the section captioned "Nonqualified Deferred Compensation in 2019."


POST-EMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION

(1)

For Termination Following a Change in Control:  Represents target 2019 annual incentive awards as described in the Grants of Plan Based Awards Table.

(2)

For Voluntary Termination and Involuntary Termination Not for Cause and Termination Upon Death or Disability: Represents 100 percent of the performance share awards under the 2017 - 2019 Long-Term Incentive Program, 67 percent of the performance share awards under the 2018 - 2020 Long-Term Incentive Program and 33 percent of the performance share awards under the 2019 - 2021 Long-Term Incentive Program.  For all of the Named Executive Officers, the values were calculated by multiplying the number of RSUs by $85.07, the closing price of Eversource common shares on December 31, 2019, the last trading day of the year.  For Termination Following a Change in Control:  Represents 100 percent of the performance share awards under each of the three programs noted in the previous two sentences.

(3)

For Voluntary Termination and Involuntary Termination Not for Cause and Termination Upon Death or Disability, represents values of RSUs granted under long-term incentive programs that, at year-end 2019, were unvested under applicable vesting schedules.  Under these programs, RSUs vest pro rata based on credited service years and age at termination, and time worked during the vesting period. For all, the values were calculated by multiplying the number of RSUs by $85.07, the closing price of Eversource common shares on December 31, 2019, the last trading day of the year.


For Termination Following a Change in Control:  Represents values of all RSUs granted under long-term incentive programs that, at year-end 2019, were unvested under applicable vesting schedules, all of which vest in full.

(4)

The amount noted in the Involuntary Termination, Not for Cause column, represents for Mr. Butler actuarial present values at year-end 2019 of amounts payable (two years of service) solely under an employment agreement upon termination, which are in addition to amounts due under the pension plan.  For Termination Following a Change in Control:  represents actuarial present values at year-end 2019 of amounts payable solely under employment agreements upon termination (which are in addition to amounts due under the pension program). For Messrs. Judge, Schweiger, Butler and Nolan, pension benefits were calculated by adding three years of service (two years for Mr. Lembo).  A lump sum of this benefit value is payable to Messrs. Judge, Lembo and Schweiger.  Pension amounts shown in the table are present values at year-end 2019 of benefits payable upon termination as described with respect to the Pension Benefits Table above.

(5)

The amount noted in the Involuntary Termination, Not for Cause column, represents for Mr. Butler the value of two years' employer contributions toward active health, long-term disability, and life insurance benefits, plus a payment to offset any taxes thereon.  For Termination Following a Change in Control:  represents estimated cost to Eversource at year-end 2019 (estimated by consultants) of providing post-employment health and welfare benefits beyond those available to non-executives upon involuntary termination.  The amounts shown in the table for Messrs. Judge, Schweiger and Nolan represent the value of three years (two years for Mr. Lembo) continued health and welfare plan participation. The amounts shown in the table for Mr. Butler represent the value of three years' employer contributions toward active health, long-term disability, and life insurance benefits, plus a payment to offset any taxes on the value of these benefits, less the value of one year of retiree health coverage at retiree rates.

(6)

The amount noted in the Involuntary Termination, Not for Cause column, represents for Mr. Butler the cost of reimbursing Mr. Butler for two years financial planning and tax preparation fees.  For Termination Following a Change in Control, represents the cost to Eversource of reimbursing for financial planning and tax preparation fees for three years (two years for Mr. Lembo).

(7)

For Termination Following a Change in Control, represents payments made to offset costs associated with certain excise taxes under Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code.  Executives may be subject to certain excise taxes under Section 280G if they receive payments and benefits related to a Termination Following a Change in Control that exceed specified Internal Revenue Service limits. Contractual agreements with the above executives provide for a grossed-up reimbursement of these excise taxes.  The amounts in the table are based on the Section 280G excise tax rate of 20 percent, the statutory federal income tax withholding rate of 35 percent, the applicable state income tax rate, and the Medicare tax rate of 1.45 percent.

(8)

For Involuntary Termination, Not for Cause, represents for Mr. Butler a severance payment (two-times the sum of base salary plus relevant annual incentive award) in addition to any non-compete agreement payment described above.  For Termination Following a Change in Control, represents severance payments in addition to any non-compete agreement payments described in the prior note.  For Messrs. Judge, Schweiger and Nolan, this payment equals three-times the sum of base salary plus relevant annual incentive award (two-times the sum for Messrs. Lembo and Butler).  These payments do not replace, offset or otherwise affect the calculation or payment of the annual incentive awards.

(9)

For Involuntary Termination, Not for Cause and Termination Following a Change in Control, represents payments made under agreements or Eversource programs to Mr. Butler as consideration for agreement not to compete with Eversource following termination of employment, equal to the sum of base salary plus relevant annual incentive award.  These payments do not replace, offset or otherwise affect the calculation or payment of the annual incentive awards.

PAY RATIO

Eversource's CEO to median employee pay ratio is calculated pursuant to the requirements of Item 402(u) of Regulation S-K.  Eversource identified the median employee by reviewing the 2019 total cash compensation of all full-time employees, excluding Eversource's CEO, who were employed by Eversource and its subsidiaries on December 31, 2019.  In Eversource's assessment of median employee compensation, pay was annualized for those employees who commenced work during 2019.  Otherwise, no assumptions, adjustments, or estimates were made with respect to total cash compensation, and the compensation for any full-time employees who were not employed Eversource at the end of 2019 was not annualized.  Eversource believes the use of total cash compensation for all employees is a consistently applied compensation measure, as Eversource does not widely distribute annual equity awards to employees.

After identifying the median employee based on total cash compensation, Eversource calculated the annual total compensation for such employee using the same methodology it uses for its Named Executive Officers as set forth in the 2019 Summary Compensation Table.

Mr. Judge had 2019 annual total compensation of $19,806,088, as reflected in the Summary Compensation Table.  Eversource's median employee's annual total compensation for 2019 was $133,899.  Eversource's 2019 CEO to median employee pay ratio is 148 to 1.

CL&P

Eversource Energy's Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers applies to the Senior Financial Officers (Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Controller) of Eversource Energy, CL&P and certain other Eversource Energy subsidiaries.  Under the Code, one's position as a Senior Financial Officer in the company may not be used to improperly benefit such officer or his or her family or friends.  Under the Code, specific activities that may be considered conflicts of interest include, but are not limited to, directly or indirectly acquiring or retaining a significant financial interest in an organization that is a customer, vendor or competitor, or that seeks to do business with the company; serving, without proper safeguards, as an officer or director of, or working or rendering services for an organization that is a customer, vendor or competitor, or that seeks to do business with the company. Waivers of the provisions of the Code of Ethics for Trustees, executive officers or directors must be approved by Eversource Energy's Board of Trustees.  Any such waivers will be disclosed pursuant to legal requirements.

Eversource Energy's Code of Conduct, which applies to all Trustees, directors, officers and employees of Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries, including CL&P, contains a Conflict of Interest Policy that requires all such individuals to disclose any potential conflicts of interest.  Such individuals are expected to discuss their particular situations with management to ensure appropriate steps are in place to avoid a conflict of interest.  All disclosures must be reviewed and approved by management to ensure a particular situation does not adversely impact the individual's primary job and role.

Eversource Energy's Related Persons Transactions Policy is administered by the Corporate Governance Committee of Eversource Energy's Board of Trustees.  The Policy generally defines a "Related Persons Transaction" as any transaction or series of transactions in which (i) Eversource Energy or a subsidiary is a participant, (ii) the aggregate amount involved exceeds $120,000 and (iii) any "Related Persons" has a direct or indirect material interest.  A "Related Persons" is defined as any Trustee or nominee for Trustee, any executive officer, any shareholder owning more than 5 percent of Eversource Energy's total outstanding shares, and any immediate family member of any such person.  Management submits to the Corporate Governance Committee for consideration any Related Persons Transaction into which Eversource Energy or a subsidiary proposes to enter.  The Corporate Governance Committee recommends to the Eversource Energy Board of Trustees for approval only those transactions that are in Eversource Energy's best interests.  If management causes the company to enter into a Related Persons Transaction prior to approval by the Corporate Governance Committee, the transaction will be subject to ratification by the Eversource Energy Board of Trustees.  If the Eversource Energy Board of Trustees determines not to ratify the transaction, then management will make all reasonable efforts to cancel or annul such transaction.

The directors of CL&P are employees of CL&P and/or other subsidiaries of Eversource Energy, and thus are not considered independent.


Item 14.    Principal Accountant Fees and Services

Eversource Energy

Incorporated herein by reference is the information contained in the section "Relationship with Independent Auditors" of Eversource Energy's definitive proxy statement for solicitation of proxies, expected to be filed with the SEC on or about March 26, 2020.

CL&P, NSTAR ELECTRIC and PSNH

Pre-Approval of Services Provided by Principal Auditors

None of CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH is subject to the audit committee requirements of the SEC, the national securities exchanges or the national securities associations.  CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH obtain audit services from the independent auditor engaged by the Audit Committee of Eversource Energy's Board of Trustees.  Eversource Energy's Audit Committee has established policies and procedures regarding the pre-approval of services provided by the principal auditors.  Those policies and procedures delegate pre-approval of services to the Eversource Energy Audit Committee Chair provided that such offices are held by Trustees who are "independent" within the meaning of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and that all such pre-approvals are presented to the Eversource Energy Audit Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee.

The following relates to fees and services for the entire Eversource Energy system, including Eversource Energy, CL&P, NSTAR Electric and PSNH.

Fees Billed By Principal Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The aggregate fees, including out of pocket expense reimbursements, billed to the Company and its subsidiaries by Deloitte & Touche LLP, the member firms of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, and their respective affiliates (collectively, the Deloitte Entities), for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $5,641,614 and $5,076,922, respectively. In addition, affiliates of Deloitte & Touche LLP, as noted below, provide other accounting services to the Company.  Fees consisted of the following:

1.    Audit Fees

The aggregate fees billed to the Company and its subsidiaries by Deloitte & Touche LLP for audit services rendered for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $4,743,400 and $4,464,500, respectively.  The audit fees were incurred for audits of consolidated financial statements of Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries, reviews of financial statements included in the Combined Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q of Eversource Energy and its subsidiaries, and other costs.  The fees also included audits of internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

2.    Audit-Related Fees

The aggregate fees billed to the Company and its subsidiaries by the Deloitte Entities for audit-related services rendered for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $851,300 and $547,500, respectively.  The audit-related fees were incurred for procedures performed in the ordinary course of business in support of certain regulatory filings, comfort letters, consents, and other costs related to registration statements and financings.

3.    Tax Fees

The aggregate fees billed to the Company and its subsidiaries by the Deloitte Entities for tax services rendered for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $45,000 and $7,500, respectively.  The tax service fees were incurred for procedures performed in the ordinary course of business in support of certain federal rulings in 2019 and certain employee benefit plan federal filings in 2018.

4.    All Other Fees

The aggregate fees billed to the Company and its subsidiaries by the Deloitte Entities for services, other than the services described above, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 totaled $1,914 and $57,422, respectively.  These fees were for a license for access to an accounting standards research tool in 2019 and 2018, and the review of benefit payment calculations in 2018.

The Audit Committee pre-approves all auditing services and permitted audit-related or other services (including the fees and terms thereof) to be performed for us by our independent registered public accounting firm, subject to the de minimis exceptions for non-audit services described in Section 10A(i)(1)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which are approved by the Audit Committee prior to the completion of the audit.  The Audit Committee may form and delegate its authority to subcommittees consisting of one or more members when appropriate, including the authority to grant pre-approvals of audit and permitted non-audit services, provided that decisions of such subcommittee to grant pre-approvals are presented to the full Audit Committee at its next scheduled meeting.  During 2019, all services described above were pre-approved by the Audit Committee or its Chair.


The Audit Committee has considered whether the provision by the Deloitte Entities of the non-audit services described above was allowed under Rule 2-01(c)(4) of Regulation S-X and was compatible with maintaining the independence of the registered public accountants and has concluded that the Deloitte Entities were and are independent of us in all respects.
