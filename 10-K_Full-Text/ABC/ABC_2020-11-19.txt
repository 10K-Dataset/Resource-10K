PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

As used herein, the terms "Company," "AmerisourceBergen," "we," "us," or "our" refer to AmerisourceBergen Corporation, a Delaware corporation.

AmerisourceBergen is one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. We deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health. More specifically, we distribute a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name, and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers located in the United States and select global markets, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, physician practices, medical and dialysis clinics, veterinarians, and other customers. Additionally, we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers with an assortment of related services, including data analytics, outcomes research, reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services, niche premium logistics services, inventory management, pharmacy automation, pharmacy management, and packaging solutions.

Industry Overview

Pharmaceutical sales in the United States, as recently estimated by IQVIA, an independent third-party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry, are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3.4% from 2019 through 2024, and the growth rate is dependent, in part, on pharmaceutical manufacturer price increases. In addition to general economic conditions, factors that impact the growth of the pharmaceutical industry in the United States and other industry trends include:

Aging Population.

The number of individuals age 65 and over in the United States is expected to exceed 63 million by 2024 and is the most rapidly growing segment of the population. This age group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and accounts for a substantial portion of total healthcare expenditures in the United States.

Introduction of New Pharmaceuticals.

Traditional research and development, as well as the advent of new research, production, and delivery methods, such as biotechnology and gene therapy, continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating diseases. We believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry. In particular, we believe ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business.

Increased Use of Generic Pharmaceuticals.

A number of patents for widely used brand-name pharmaceutical products will continue to expire during the next several years. In addition, increased emphasis by managed care and other third-party payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth. We consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brand-name products, although their lower prices reduce revenue growth. Generic pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 90% of the prescription volume in the United States.

Increased Use of Drug Therapies.

In response to rising healthcare costs, governmental and private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug therapies to prevent or treat diseases. While national attention has been focused on the overall increase in aggregate healthcare costs, we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays. Pharmaceuticals currently account for approximately 11% of overall healthcare costs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers' continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction of cost-effective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies.



Legislative Developments.

In 2010, the federal government enacted major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance, which increased the number of people in the United States who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of prescription drug costs. The health reform law provides for sweeping changes to Medicare and Medicaid policies (including drug reimbursement policies), expanded disclosure requirements regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry, enhanced enforcement authority to prevent fraud and abuse, and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. Subsequent legislation and rules promulgated by government agencies have made additional changes to federal drug payment policies. These policies and other legislative developments (including potential revisions to or repeal of any portions of the health reform legislation) may affect our businesses directly and/or indirectly (see Government Regulation on page 6 and the risk factor titled

Legal, regulatory, and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement, pricing, and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations, including through declining reimbursement rates

on page 12 for further details).

COVID-19 Pandemic.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization ("WHO") declared a global pandemic attributable to the outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19. In connection with the mitigation and containment procedures recommended by the WHO and imposed by federal, state, and local governmental authorities, we implemented measures designed to keep our employees safe and address business continuity issues at our distribution centers and other locations. We continue to evaluate and plan for the potential effects of a prolonged disruption and the related impacts on our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. These items include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of our customers and the realization of accounts receivable, decreased availability and demand for our products and services, and delays related to current and future projects. While our operational and financial performance may be significantly impacted by COVID-19, it is not possible for us to predict the duration or magnitude of the outbreak and whether it could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows (see Risk Factor -

We face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, and the continued spread of COVID-19 is adversely affecting our business).

Other economic conditions and certain risk factors could adversely affect our business and prospects (see Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 8).

The Company

We serve our customers (healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers) through a geographically diverse network of distribution service centers and other operations in the United States and select global markets. In our pharmaceutical distribution business, we are typically the primary supplier of pharmaceutical and related products to our healthcare provider customers. We offer a broad range of services to our customers designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations, which allow them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and to lower overall costs in the pharmaceutical supply channel.

Strategy

Our business strategy is focused on the global pharmaceutical supply channel where we provide value-added distribution and global commercialization services to healthcare providers (primarily pharmacies, health systems, medical and dialysis clinics, physicians, and veterinarians) and pharmaceutical manufacturers that improve channel efficiencies and patient outcomes. Implementing this disciplined and focused strategy in a seamless and unified way has allowed us to significantly expand our business, and we believe we are well positioned to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following key elements of our business strategy:

•

Optimize and Grow Our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Strategic Global Sourcing Businesses.

We believe we are well positioned in size and market breadth to continue to grow our distribution businesses as we invest to improve our operating and capital efficiencies. Distribution, including specialty pharmaceuticals, anchors our growth and position in the pharmaceutical supply channel as we provide superior distribution services and deliver value-added solutions, which improve the efficiency and competitiveness of both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers, thus allowing the pharmaceutical supply channel to better deliver healthcare to patients.

We are a leader in distribution and services to community oncologists and have leading positions in other physician-administered products. We distribute plasma and other blood products, injectable pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty products. We are well positioned to service and support many of the new biotechnology therapies that are expected to be coming to market in the near future.

We have introduced strategies to enhance our position in the generic marketplace, including our generic product private label program based in Ireland. We source generics globally, offer a value-added generic formulary program to our healthcare provider customers, and monitor our customers' compliance with our generics program. We also provide data and other valuable services to our manufacturer customers, which includes our international presence in Switzerland where we lead our global manufacturer relations and commercialization strategy.



We offer value-added services and solutions to assist healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers to improve their efficiency and their patient outcomes. Services for manufacturers include: assistance with rapid new product launches, promotional and marketing services to accelerate product sales, product data reporting, and logistical support.

Our provider solutions include: our Good Neighbor Pharmacy® program, which enables independent community pharmacies to compete more effectively through pharmaceutical benefit and merchandising programs; Elevate Provider Network®, our managed care network, which connects our retail pharmacy customers to payor plans throughout the country and is one of the largest in the United States; generic product purchasing and private label services; hospital pharmacy consulting designed to improve operational efficiencies; and packaging solutions for institutional and retail healthcare providers.

We believe we have one of the lowest operating cost structures among all pharmaceutical distributors. Our robust distribution facility network includes a national distribution center in Columbus, OH, which offers pharmaceutical manufacturers a single shipping destination. We continue to seek opportunities to achieve increased productivity and operating income gains as we invest in and continue to implement warehouse automation technology, adopt "best practices" in warehousing activities, and increase operating leverage by increasing volume per full-service distribution facility. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our offerings in our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Strategic Global Sourcing businesses.

•

Optimize and Grow Our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health Businesses.

Our consulting service businesses help global pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers commercialize their products. We believe we are the largest provider of reimbursement services that assist pharmaceutical companies in supporting access to branded drugs. We also provide outcomes research, contract field staffing, patient assistance and copay assistance programs, adherence programs, risk mitigation services, and other market access programs to pharmaceutical companies. World Courier is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. World Courier further strengthens our service offerings to global pharmaceutical manufacturers and provides an established platform for the introduction of our specialty services outside North America. MWI Animal Health (“MWI”) sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. MWI also offers its customers a variety of value-added services, including its e-commerce platform, technology management systems, pharmacy fulfillment, inventory management system, equipment procurement consultation, special order fulfillment, and educational seminars, which we believe closely integrate MWI with its customers' day-to-day operations and provide them with meaningful incentives to continue doing business with MWI. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our offerings in our Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health businesses.

•

Acquisitions.

In order to grow our core strategic offerings and to enter related markets, we have acquired and invested in businesses and will continue to consider additional acquisitions and investments.

•

Divestitures.

In order to allow us to concentrate on our strategic focus areas, we have divested certain non-core businesses and may, from time to time, consider additional divestitures. In January 2020, we decided to permanently exit the PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings LLC’s ("PharMEDium") compounding business, and, as a result, the Company ceased all commercial and administrative operations related to this business in fiscal 2020. The decision to permanently exit the PharMEDium business was due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, ongoing operational, regulatory, and commercial challenges.

Operations

Operating Structure.

We are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers. Our operations as of September 30, 2020 are comprised of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment and other operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure, and, therefore, have been included in Other for the purpose of reportable segment presentation.

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services Segment

Servicing healthcare providers in the pharmaceutical supply channel, the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment's operations provide drug distribution, strategic global sourcing, and related services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes.

The Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and



equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. Through a number of operating businesses, the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. Additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers.

Other

Other consists of operating segments that focus on global commercialization services and animal health and includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services ("ABCS"), World Courier, and MWI.

ABCS, through a number of operating businesses, provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that range from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. World Courier, which operates in more than 50 countries, is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry. MWI is a leading animal health distribution company in the United States and in the United Kingdom. MWI sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. Additionally, MWI offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers.

Sales and Marketing.

The majority of Pharmaceutical Distribution Services’ sales force is led nationally, with geographic focus and specialized by either healthcare provider type or size. Customer service representatives are centralized in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective manner. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service offerings. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services’ sales teams also serve national account customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensure that our customers are receiving service offerings that meet their needs. Our other operating segments each have independent sales forces that specialize in their respective product and service offerings. In addition, we have an enterprise-wide marketing team that coordinates branding and all other marketing activities across the Company.

Customers.

We have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers. Institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals, health systems, mail order pharmacies, long-term care and other alternate care pharmacies, and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities, physicians, and physician group practices. Retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains, independent community pharmacies, pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers, and veterinarians. We are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider customers. Our manufacturer customers include branded, generic, and biotechnology manufacturers of prescription pharmaceuticals, as well as over-the-counter product and health and beauty aid manufacturers. In addition, we offer a broad range of value-added solutions designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers, thereby allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers.

Our two largest customers, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ("WBA") and Express Scripts, Inc. ("Express Scripts"), accounted for approximately 33% and approximately 12%, respectively, of revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Our top 10 customers, including governmental agencies and group purchasing organizations ("GPO"), represented approximately 64% of revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The loss of any major customer or GPO relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations. Additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended, renewed, or replaced prior to their expiration dates. If those contracts are not renewed or are extended, renewed, or replaced at less favorable terms, they may negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.

Suppliers.

We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which accounted for 10% or more of our purchases in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. The loss of a supplier could adversely affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are strong. The 10 largest suppliers in fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 accounted for approximately 46% of our purchases.

Information Systems.

The Pharmaceutical Distribution Services operating segment recently transitioned its key specialty distribution businesses onto its primary enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system. As a result, the pharmaceutical distribution facilities in the United States all now operate under a single ERP system. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services’



ERP system provides for, among other things, electronic order entry by customers, invoice preparation and purchasing, and inventory tracking. All of our other operating segments operate the majority of their businesses on their own common operating systems resulting in the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities. We continue to make investments to enhance and upgrade the operating systems utilized by our other operating segments.

Additionally, we are improving our entity-wide infrastructure environment to drive efficiency, capabilities, and speed to market.

We will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology. For example, in an effort to comply with future pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements (see Risk Factor -

Increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding may increase our costs and reduce our profitability)

, we expect to continue to make significant investments in our secure supply chain information systems.

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services has made significant investments in its electronic ordering systems. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services’ systems are intended to strengthen customer relationships by helping customers to reduce operating costs, and by providing them a platform for a number of the basic and value-added services, including product demand data, inventory replenishment, single-source billing, third-party claims processing, real-time price and incentive updates, and price labels.

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services processes a substantial portion of its purchase orders, invoices, and payments electronically, and it continues to make substantial investments to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services has warehouse operating systems, which are used to manage the majority of Pharmaceutical Distribution Services’ transactional volume. The warehouse operating systems have improved Pharmaceutical Distribution Services’ productivity and operating leverage.

A significant portion of our data center operations, which were previously outsourced to third-party providers, is now insourced.

Competition

We face a highly competitive global environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services. Our largest competitors are McKesson Corporation ("McKesson"), Cardinal Health, Inc. ("Cardinal"), FFF Enterprises, Henry Schein, Inc., and UPS Logistics, among others. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services competes with both McKesson and Cardinal, as well as national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution. In addition, we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers, chain drugstores who manage their own warehousing, specialty distributors, and packaging and healthcare technology companies. ABCS, World Courier, and MWI also face competition from a variety of businesses. In all areas, competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added service programs, service and delivery, credit terms, and customer support.

Intellectual Property

We use a number of trademarks and service marks. All of the principal trademarks and service marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the United States and, in some cases, in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration.

We have developed or acquired various proprietary products, processes, software, and other intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are made available as products or services to customers. We generally seek to protect such intellectual property through a combination of trade secret, patent and copyright laws, and through confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections.

We hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products, particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment, our medication and supply dispensing equipment, certain warehousing equipment, and some of our proprietary packaging solutions. We seek patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate.

Although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties, third parties may assert infringement claims against us from time to time.



Human Capital

We aspire to create healthier futures and accelerate business results by inspiring the best and brightest global talent across all dimensions of diversity to perform at their full potential.

As of September 30, 2020, we had approximately 22,000 employees, of which approximately 21,000 were full-time employees. More than 56% of our workforce is comprised of women, 49% is comprised of individuals with ethnically diverse backgrounds, and 30% of our Board of Directors are women. Additionally, our Executive Management Committee is made up of 43% women.

Approximately 2% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. If any of our employees in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any existing collective bargaining agreements, such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and adversely affect our results of operations. However, we believe we have adequate contingency plans in place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions.

Government Regulation

We are subject to extensive oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are subject to, and affected by, a variety of federal and state laws, regulations, and policies.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration ("DEA"), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"), and various other federal and state authorities regulate the purchase, storage, and/or distribution of pharmaceutical products, including controlled substances. Wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid DEA licenses, meet various security and operating standards, and comply with regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding, and distribution of controlled substances.

We and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws, including the federal anti-kickback statute and False Claims Act. The anti-kickback statute prohibits persons from soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing, leasing, or ordering, induce a referral to purchase, lease, or order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing, or ordering items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. The False Claims Act prohibits knowingly submitting, or causing the submission, of false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government, and authorizes treble damages and substantial civil penalties in the case of violations. The fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent and varied interpretation.

In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel. These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, diverted, adulterated, or mislabeled pharmaceuticals into the distribution system. At the federal level, the supply chain security legislation known as the Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”) became law in 2013. The DQSA establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the lot level, preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and will require all supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable prescription drug traceability system. The DQSA also establishes requirements for drug wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed third-party logistics providers. We expect that the FDA, and eventually comparable state agencies, will promulgate implementing regulations governing wholesale distributor and third-party logistics providers.  There can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the DQSA requirements, or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements, and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our operations into compliance. These and other requirements will continue to increase the cost of our operations.

The regulation of public and private health insurance and benefit programs can also affect our business and scrutiny of the healthcare delivery and reimbursement systems in the United States can be expected to continue at both the state and federal levels. This process may result in additional legislation and/or regulation governing the production, delivery, or pricing of pharmaceutical products and other healthcare services. In addition, changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or the discontinuation of our ability to continue to operate certain of our distribution centers, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Any future reductions in Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase drugs from us. We cannot predict what additional initiatives, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.

We are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental laws, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling, and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, as well as laws relating to safe working conditions and laboratory practices.



The costs, burdens, and/or impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 8 for a discussion of additional legal and regulatory developments, as well as enforcement actions or other litigation that may arise out of our failure to adequately comply with applicable laws and regulations that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Health Information and Privacy Practices

The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") and its implementing regulations set forth privacy and security standards designed to protect the privacy of and provide for the security of protected health information, as defined under the HIPAA regulations. Some of our businesses collect, maintain, and/or access protected health information and are subject to the HIPAA regulations. Our operations, depending on their location, may also be subject to state or foreign regulations affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are provided. Significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of HIPAA standards and other such laws. We have a HIPAA compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with the HIPAA regulations.

The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH Act") strengthened federal privacy and security provisions governing protected health information. Among other things, the HITECH Act expanded certain aspects of the HIPAA privacy and security rules, imposed new notification requirements related to health data security breaches, broadened the rights of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS") to enforce HIPAA, and directed HHS to publish more specific security standards. In January 2013, the Office for Civil Rights of HHS published the HIPAA omnibus final rule ("HIPAA Final Rule"), which amended certain aspects of the HIPAA privacy, security, and enforcement rules pursuant to the HITECH Act, extending certain HIPAA obligations to business associates and their subcontractors. Certain components of our business act as "business associates" within the meaning of HIPAA and are subject to these additional obligations under the HIPAA Final Rule.

Some of our businesses collect, maintain, and/or access other personal information (including sensitive personal information) that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information, in addition to the requirements of HIPAA, the HITECH Act, and the implementing regulations. Personally identifiable information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate. As such regulations continue to evolve, we must comply with applicable privacy and security requirements of these countries, including but not limited to those in the European Union. Most notably certain aspects of our business are subject to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") which became effective on May 25, 2018, the California Consumer Protection Act ("CCPA"), which became effective on January 1, 2020, and Brazil's new General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados Pessoais) – Law No. 13,709/208 ("LGPD") which became effective in August 2020. We have implemented a privacy and information security compliance program to facilitate our ongoing efforts to comply with the applicable privacy laws and regulations. There can be no assurances that compliance with these requirements will not impose new costs on our business.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our business and prospects. These risk factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this report. Our business operations could also be affected by additional factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider not to be material. The reader should not consider this list to be a complete statement of all risks and uncertainties.

Industry and Economic Risks

Our results of operations could be adversely impacted by manufacturer pricing changes.

In fiscal 2020, we continued to experience unfavorable brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing trends, which negatively impacted our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment profit and our consolidated operating earnings. We expect these trends to continue in fiscal 2021, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our contractual arrangements with pharmaceutical manufacturers for the purchase of brand pharmaceutical products generally use wholesale acquisition cost ("WAC") as the reference price. We sell brand pharmaceutical products to many of our customers using WAC as the reference price and to other customers based on their negotiated contract price. If manufacturers change their pricing policies or practices with regard to WAC or if prices charged by manufacturers do not align with prices negotiated to be paid by our customers, and we are unable to negotiate alternative ways to be compensated by manufacturers or customers for the value of our services, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, there are a number of government policy initiatives being considered which, if enacted, could directly or indirectly regulate or impact WAC prices. If such initiatives are passed or finalized and we are unable to negotiate equitable changes with our suppliers and/or customers, our results of operations could be adversely impacted.

The pharmaceutical products that we purchase are also subject to price inflation and deflation. Additionally, certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with brand and generic pharmaceutical manufacturers have a price appreciation component to them. As a result, our gross profit from brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals continues to be subject to fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases, which we do not control. If the frequency or rate of brand and generic pharmaceutical price increases slows, whether due to regulatory mandates, the implementation of legislative proposals, policy initiatives or voluntary manufacturer actions, our results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, generic pharmaceuticals are also subject to price deflation. If the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates, the negative impact on our results of operations will be greater.

Competition and industry consolidation may erode our profit.

As described in greater detail in the "Competition" section beginning on page 5, the industries in which we operate are highly competitive. In addition, in recent years the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing consolidation, including among pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail pharmacies, and health insurers, which may create further competitive pressures on our pharmaceutical distribution business. If we do not compete successfully, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The impact on us will be greater if consolidation among our customers, suppliers, and competitors gives the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which could lead to greater pressure on us to reduce prices for our products and services.

Our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a significant customer.

Most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit. Credit is made available to customers based upon our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness. Although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to protect our credit exposure, we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured. Volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, and regulatory changes, including changes in reimbursement, may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased volatility of the capital and credit markets and has led to a general worsening of economic conditions, which has put financial pressure on many of our customers and may threaten certain customers’ ability to maintain liquidity sufficient to repay their obligations to us as they become due. The bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our operating revenue and results of operations. As of September 30, 2020, our two largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 47% and 7% of accounts receivable, net.



Our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of a significant supplier.

Our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers, including amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods, chargebacks, and amounts due to us for services provided to the suppliers. Volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic conditions, pending litigation, and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our suppliers. The bankruptcy, insolvency, or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial market volatility and disruption or a downgrade in our credit ratings.

If the capital and credit markets experience significant disruption and volatility in the future, there can be no assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect, which may be material, on our ability to access credit. Although we believe that our operating cash flow and existing credit arrangements give us the ability to meet our financing needs, there can be no assurance that disruption and volatility will not increase our costs of borrowing, impair our liquidity, or adversely impact our business.

Additionally, rating agencies continually review the ratings they have assigned to us and our outstanding debt securities. To maintain our ratings, we are required to meet certain financial performance ratios. Liabilities related to litigation or any significant related settlements, an increase in our debt or a decline in our earnings could result in downgrades in our credit ratings. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, could limit our access to public debt markets, limit the institutions willing to provide credit to us, result in more restrictive financial and other covenants in our public and private debt, and would likely increase our overall borrowing costs and adversely affect our earnings.

Declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the United States and other countries where we do business. Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers, which would negatively affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. Negative trends in the general economy, including interest rate fluctuations, financial market volatility, or credit market disruptions, may also affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms and reduce discretionary spending on health products. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our cash flow from operations. Bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. Declining economic conditions may also increase our costs. If the economic conditions in the United States or in the countries where we do business deteriorate, our results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Business and Operational Risks

Our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss, or renewal at less favorable terms, of a significant customer or group purchasing organization.

WBA accounted for approximately 33% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Express Scripts accounted for approximately 12% of our revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. Our top ten customers, including governmental agencies and GPOs, represented approximately 64% of revenue in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020. We may lose a significant customer or GPO relationship if any existing contract with such customer or GPO expires without being extended, renewed, renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or GPO prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. A number of our contracts with significant customers or GPOs are typically subject to expiration each year and we may lose any of these customers or GPO relationships if we are unable to extend, renew, renegotiate or replace the contracts. The loss of any significant customer or GPO relationship could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. Additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be renewed or modified prior to their expiration date in furtherance of our strategic objectives. If those contracts are renewed or modified at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.

The anticipated ongoing strategic and financial benefits of our relationship with WBA may not be realized.

In May 2016, we extended to 2026 our strategic arrangement with WBA - specifically, our distribution agreement under which we distribute drugs to Walgreens pharmacies and our generics purchasing services arrangement under which



Walgreens Boots Alliance Development GmbH ("WBAD") provides a variety of services, including negotiating acquisition pricing with generic manufacturers on our behalf. This reflected our expectation that partnering strategically with WBA would result in various benefits including, among other things, continued cost savings as a result of our generics purchasing services arrangement with WBAD, as well as the potential for exploring innovation together and sharing best practices. The processes and initiatives needed to achieve and maintain these benefits are complex, costly, and time-consuming. Achieving the anticipated benefits from the arrangement on an ongoing basis is subject to a number of significant challenges and uncertainties, including: the potential inability to realize and/or delays in realizing potential benefits resulting from participation in our generics purchasing services arrangement with WBAD, including improved generic drug pricing and terms, improved service fees from generic manufacturers, cost savings, innovations, or other benefits due to its inability to negotiate successfully with generic manufacturers or otherwise to perform as expected; the potential disruption of our plans and operations as a result of the terms under which we extended the duration of the distribution agreement and generics purchasing services agreement, including any disruption of our cash flow and ability to return value to our stockholders in accordance with our past practices and any reduction in our operational, strategic or financial flexibility; potential changes in supplier relationships and terms; unexpected or unforeseen costs, fees, expenses and charges incurred by us related to the transaction or the overall strategic relationship; changes in the economic terms under which we distribute pharmaceuticals to WBA, including changes necessitated by changing market conditions or other unforeseen developments that may arise during the term of the distribution agreement, to the extent that any such changes are not offset by other financial benefits that we are able to obtain through collaboration in other aspects of our strategic relationship with WBA; and any potential issues that could impede our ability to continue to work collaboratively with WBA in an efficient and effective manner in furtherance of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits of the relationship.

In addition, WBA has the right, but not the obligation, under the transactions contemplated by the Framework and Shareholder Agreements dated March 18, 2013 to make certain additional investments in our common stock. WBA also has the right to sell any of the shares of our common stock that it has acquired so long as WBA has held the shares beyond the requisite dates specified in the Shareholder Agreement. Any sales in the public market of common stock currently held by WBA or acquired by WBA pursuant to open market purchases could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. We could also encounter unforeseen costs, circumstances, or issues with respect to the transactions and collaboration we anticipate pursuing with WBA. Many of these potential circumstances are outside of our control and any of them could result in increased costs, decreased revenue, decreased benefits and the diversion of management time and attention. If we are unable to achieve any of our objectives, the expected future benefits may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

A disruption in our distribution or generic purchasing services arrangements with WBA could adversely affect our business and financial results.

We are the primary distributor of pharmaceutical products for WBA. If our operations are seriously disrupted for any reason deemed within our control, we may have an obligation to pay or credit WBA for failure to supply products. In addition, upon the expiration or termination of the distribution agreement or generics purchasing services arrangement, there can be no assurance that we or WBA will be willing to renew, on terms favorable to us or at all.

Our generic pharmaceutical program has also benefited from the generics purchasing services arrangement with WBA. If the operations of WBA are seriously disrupted for any reason, whether by the global coronavirus ("COVID-19") pandemic, natural disaster, labor disruption, regulatory or governmental action, or otherwise, it could adversely affect our business and our sales and profitability. Moreover, if the economic benefits we are able to obtain through the generics purchasing services arrangement with WBA decline due to changes in market conditions or other changes impacting the fees and rebates that generic manufacturers make available through the arrangement, our margins and results of operations could also be adversely affected.

In addition, our business may be adversely affected by any operational, financial, or regulatory difficulties that WBA experiences, including any disruptions of certain of its existing distribution facilities or retail pharmacies resulting from ongoing inspections by the DEA and/or state regulatory agencies and possible revocation of the controlled substance registrations for those facilities and pharmacies.

Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake acquisitions of or investments in businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to integrate.

As part of our strategy we seek to pursue acquisitions of and investments in other companies. At any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion, and negotiation with regard to one or more potential acquisitions or investments, not all of which will be consummated. We make public disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable securities laws and regulations.



Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties and may be of businesses in which we lack operational or market experience. If we complete one or more acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including: regulatory or compliance issues that could arise; changes in regulations and laws; the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have projected in either the near or long term; the assumption of unknown liabilities, including litigation risks; the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed not being properly estimated; the difficulties of imposing adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls; the difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies; and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions.

Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we fail to manage and complete divestitures.

We regularly evaluate our portfolio in order to determine whether an asset or business may no longer help us meet our objectives. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. The impact of a divestiture on our results of operations could also be greater than anticipated.

Our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by our global operations.

Our operations in jurisdictions outside of the United States are subject to various risks inherent in global operations. We currently have operations in over 50 countries. We may conduct business in additional foreign jurisdictions in the future, which may carry operational risks in addition to the risks of acquisition described above. At any particular time, our global operations may be affected by local changes in laws, regulations, and the political and economic environments, including inflation, recession, currency volatility, and competition. Changes or uncertainty in U.S. or foreign policy, including any changes or uncertainty with respect to U.S. or international trade policies or tariffs, also can disrupt our global operations, as well as our customers and suppliers, in a particular location and may require us to spend more money to source certain products or materials that we purchase. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.

We are subject to operational and logistical risks that might not be covered by insurance.

We have distribution centers and facilities located in the United States and throughout the world. Our business exposes us to risks that are inherent in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and the provision of related services, including with respect to cold chain storage and shipping. We anticipate that the volume of cold chain storage and shipping may increase due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as we assist with the strategic national stockpile as well as possible distribution of COVID-19 vaccines. Although we seek to maintain adequate insurance coverage, coverage on acceptable terms might be unavailable, or coverage might not cover our losses or may require large deductibles. Uninsured losses or operational losses that result in large deductible payments in order to receive insurance coverage might have an adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.

Litigation and Regulatory Risks

Increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our costs and reduce our profitability.

The healthcare industry in the United States is highly regulated at the federal and state levels. There have been increasing efforts by Congress and state and federal agencies, including state boards of pharmacy, departments of health, and the FDA, to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system. Regulation of pharmaceutical distribution is intended to prevent diversion and the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated, and/or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system. Consequently, we are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws, which include operating and security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies. In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to protect the safety and security of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution.

At the federal level, the DQSA establishes federal traceability standards requiring drugs to be labeled and tracked at the bottle level, preempts state drug pedigree requirements, and will require all supply-chain stakeholders to participate in an electronic, interoperable prescription drug traceability system by November 2023. The DQSA, and in particular Title II of the DQSA, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act ("DSCSA") also established requirements for drug wholesale distributors and



third-party logistics providers, including licensing requirements applicable in states that had not previously licensed third-party logistics providers.

There can be no assurance that we are fully compliant with the DQSA requirements, including the DSCSA requirements, or with additional related state regulatory and licensing requirements, and any failure to comply may result in suspension or delay of certain operations and additional costs to bring our facilities into compliance. Our international operations may also be subject to local regulations containing record-keeping and other obligations related to our distribution operations in those locations. Pedigree tracking laws increase our compliance burden and our pharmaceutical distribution costs and could have an adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations.

As discussed in the risk factor below about public concern over the abuse of opioid medications, certain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the United States. In addition to conducting investigations and participating in litigation related to the misuse of prescription opioid medications, federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are considering legislation and regulatory measures to limit opioid prescriptions and more closely monitor product distribution, prescribing, and dispensing of these drugs.

Complying with the DQSA requirements, including the DSCSA requirements, and other chain of custody and pharmaceutical distribution requirements, including follow-on actions related to current public concern over the abuse of opioid medications, could result in suspension or delays in our production and distribution activities which may increase our costs and could otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.

Legal, regulatory, and legislative changes with respect to reimbursement, pricing, and contracting may adversely affect our business and results of operations, including through declining reimbursement rates.

Both our business and our customers' businesses may be adversely affected by laws and regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services, changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined, or regulating pricing, contracting, and discounting practices with respect to medical products and services. Additionally, on occasion, price increases and pricing practices with respect to certain brand and generic pharmaceuticals have been the subject of U.S. Congressional inquiries, federal and state investigations and private litigation. Any law or regulation impacting pharmaceutical pricing or reimbursement, such as pricing controls or indexing models at the federal or state level, could adversely affect our operations.

Federal insurance and healthcare reform legislation known as the Affordable Care Act ("ACA") became law in March 2010, and included numerous reforms broadening healthcare access and affecting Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, pricing, and contracting for prescription drugs, including changes to the Medicaid rebate statute. Given the scope of the changes made by the ACA and continuing implementation controversies, we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the law on our operations. Likewise, we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal any provisions of the ACA may have on the ACA or other healthcare legislation and regulation.

Subsequent legislation has made additional changes to federal drug payment policies, including the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which increased the Medicaid rebate due with respect to line extensions of single source or innovator multiple source oral solid dosage form drugs. The federal government and state governments could take other actions in the future that impact Medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts or the cost of drugs. Any reduction in the Medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multiple source pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability. There can be no assurance that recent or future changes in Medicaid prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our business. Unless we are able to successfully advocate to prevent or mitigate the impact of these legislative and regulatory changes, these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations.

Our businesses also sell specialty and other drugs to physicians, hospitals, community oncology practices and other providers that are reimbursed under Part B of the Medicare program. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS") published a final rule in November 2017 that reduces Medicare outpatient hospital reimbursement for separately payable drugs (other than vaccines) purchased through the 340B drug discount program from average sales price ("ASP") plus 6% to ASP minus 22.5% (with certain exceptions), effective January 2018. In July 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia reversed the district court’s decision, which would allow the payment reductions to take effect. While the appeals process is still underway, CMS solicited comments in the proposed calendar year 2020 Medicare outpatient prospective payment system rule on appropriate payment for such 340B-acquired drugs, and finalized a rule in November 2019 that would impose the same ASP minus 22.5% rate that was the subject of the litigation described above.  Separately, November 2018, CMS published a final rule that reduces from 6% to 3% the “add-on” payment for new, separately-payable Part B drugs and



biologicals that are paid based on WAC when ASP data during first quarter or sales is unavailable. There can be no assurance that recent or future rules established by CMS will not have an adverse impact on our business.

Further, even where the government does not affirmatively change drug price regulation standards, other parties in the drug manufacturing and distribution system may change their interpretation or approach to implementing or complying with those standards, in a manner that may adversely affect our business.  For example, the 340B drug discount program requires manufacturers to provide discounts on outpatient drugs to “covered entity” safety net providers, and previous Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) guidance has allowed covered entities to dispense 340B discounted drugs through arrangements with multiple “contract pharmacies.” Recently, several manufacturers have announced initiatives that may inhibit or limit covered entities’ ability to use any, or multiple, contract pharmacies, and may direct us not to honor 340B discounted pricing requests on orders to be shipped to contract pharmacies (or may not honor chargebacks where such discounts are extended to contract pharmacies). HRSA has initially indicated that it lacks regulatory authority to enforce its prior guidance allowing multiple contract pharmacies, but recently advised that it is considering whether it may have other enforcement remedies in the event that manufacturers do not extend 340B discounts through contract pharmacy arrangements. Our customers include covered entities and organizations with significant participation as contract pharmacies, and the unavailability of 340B discounts through contract pharmacy arrangements may adversely affect such customers and, therefore, could adversely affect our business.

The federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce Medicare and/or Medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on healthcare entities. Notably, the Trump Administration and members of Congress proposed numerous amendments to Part B drug distribution and payment models during 2018. The Trump Administration has also sought to implement demonstration projects that may affect drug payments.  Some of these proposals could have significant effects on our business, including an Executive Order issued on September 13, 2020 to test a "Most Favored Nations" model for Part B and Part D drugs that tie reimbursement rates to international drug pricing metrics. Any future reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates or modifications to Medicare drug pricing regulations such as ASP calculations could negatively impact our customers' businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us, or could indirectly affect the structure of our relationships with manufacturers and our customers. At this time, we can provide no assurances that future Medicare and/or Medicaid payment or policy changes, if adopted, would not have a material adverse effect on our business.

Finally, federal and state governments may adopt policies affecting drug pricing and contracting practices outside of the context of federal programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, which may adversely affect our business. For example, several states have adopted laws that require drug manufacturers to provide advance notice of certain price increases and to report information relating to those price increases, while others have taken legislative or administrative action to establish prescription drug affordability boards or multi-payer purchasing pools to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. On July 31, 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services announced a “Safe Importation Action Plan” that outlines two potential pathways to allow importation of certain drugs from foreign markets.  On July 24, 2020, the Trump Administration issued an “Executive Order on Increasing Drug Importation to Lower Prices for American Patients” calling for the federal government to exercise its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to permit drug imports from Canada, re-importation of certain insulin products, and case-by-case waivers to certain importers provided such importation poses no risk to public safety and results in lower costs. There can be no assurances that future changes to drug reimbursement policies, drug pricing and contracting practices outside of federal healthcare programs, or to government drug price regulation programs such as the Medicaid rebate, ASP, or 340B program will not have an adverse impact on our business.

If we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse, we could suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal government continues to strengthen its scrutiny of practices potentially involving healthcare fraud affecting Medicare, Medicaid and other government healthcare programs. Our relationships with healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which, among other things, (i) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other government-sponsored healthcare programs and (ii) impose a number of restrictions upon referring physicians and providers of designated health services under Medicare and Medicaid programs. Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel substantially increased funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse, and these enforcement authorities were further expanded by the ACA. Many states have enacted similar statutes which are not necessarily limited to items and services for which payment is made by federal healthcare programs. While we believe that we are in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, many of the regulations applicable to us, including those



relating to certain incentives offered in connection with sales of pharmaceutical products and related services, are vague or indefinite, and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal and state healthcare programs.

Public concern over the abuse of opioid medications, including increased legal and regulatory action, could negatively affect our business.

Certain governmental and regulatory agencies, as well as state and local jurisdictions, are focused on the abuse of opioid medications in the United States. Federal, state and local governmental and regulatory agencies are conducting investigations of us and others in the supply chain, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, regarding the distribution of opioid medications. In addition, a significant number of lawsuits have been filed against us, other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, and others in the supply chain by state and local governmental entities and other plaintiffs for claims related to the Company’s distribution of opioid medications. The lawsuits against us and other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors allege, among other claims, that we failed to provide effective controls and procedures to guard against the diversion of controlled substances, acted negligently by distributing controlled substances to pharmacies that serve individuals who abuse controlled substances, and failed to report suspicious orders of controlled substances in accordance with regulations. Additional governmental and regulatory entities have indicated an intent to sue and may conduct investigations of us in the future and lawsuits could be brought against the Company by other plaintiffs under other theories related to opioid abuse. We are deeply committed to diversion control efforts, have sophisticated systems in place to identify orders placed warranting further review to determine if they are suspicious (including through the use of data analytics), and engage in significant due diligence and ongoing monitoring of customers. While we are vigorously defending ourselves in these lawsuits, the allegations may negatively affect our business in various ways, including through increased costs and harm to our re

putation.

We are currently engaged in advanced discussions, which are ongoing, with the objective of reaching potential terms (which would include monetary payments and certain changes to our anti-diversion programs) for a global resolution of the multi-district opioid litigation involving c

ertain state and local governmental entities

and other related state court litigation described in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. While a global settlement with respect to certain governmental entities within the Multidistrict Litigation ("MDL") and other related state court litigation remains subject to contingencies that could impact whether the parties ultimately decide to move forward, we believe a global settlement is probable and its liability related thereto can be reasonably estimated as of September 30, 2020. We have recorded a charge of $6.6 billion in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 related to the global settlement and other related opioid litigation. Until such time as a plaintiff participates in a global settlement or otherwise resolves its lawsuit, we will continue to litigate and prepare for trial in the cases pending in the multi-district opioid litigation, those remanded from the multi-district opioid litigation to federal district courts, as well as in state courts where lawsuits have been filed, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves in all such cases. Since these matters are still developing, we are unable to predict the outcome, but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts and/or injunctive relief, including changes to our anti-diversion programs, that may affect how we operate our business. Further, any final settlement amongst parties may differ materially from our advanced discussions related to global resolution of the multi-district opioid litigation. The inability to reach a global settlement of the multi-district opioid litigation and adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits or investigations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and cash flows and could result in a lower than historical level of capital available for deployment, including a lower level of capital returned to stockholders.

Legislative, regulatory or industry measures to address the misuse of prescription opioid medications may also affect our business in ways that we are not be able to predict. For example, New York has instituted an opioid excise tax, which went into effect on July 1, 2019 and replaces a prior assessment under New York's Opioid Stewardship Act, and taxes entities that make the initial sale or distribution of opioid medications into the state. In addition, Rhode Island and Delaware have enacted opioid taxes, Minnesota has enacted increased licensure fees, and other states are considering legislation that could require entities to pay an assessment or tax on the sale or distribution of opioid medications in those states. If additional state or local jurisdictions enact legislation that taxes or assesses the sale or distribution of opioid medications and we are not able to mitigate the impact on our business through operational changes or commercial arrangements where permitted, such legislation in the aggregate may have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows, or financial condition.

Our business, results of operations, and cash flows could be adversely affected by legal proceedings.

We conduct our operations through a variety of businesses, including the distribution of pharmaceuticals, the dispensing of healthcare products, and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry. Each of our businesses may cause us to become involved in legal disputes or proceedings. These disputes or proceedings have involved or may involve



healthcare fraud and abuse, the False Claims Act, antitrust, class action, commercial, employment, environmental, intellectual property, licensing, public disclosures and various other claims, including claims related to opioid medications as discussed in the above risk factor. Litigation is costly, time-consuming, and disruptive to ordinary business operations. The defense and resolution of these current and future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Violations of various federal and state laws, including with respect to the marketing, sale, purchase, and dispensing of pharmaceutical products and the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry, can result in criminal, civil, and administrative liability for which there can be significant financial damages, criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from participation in federal and state health programs. Any settlement, judgment or fine could materially adversely affect our results of operations.

Statutory and/or regulatory violations could also form the basis for qui tam complaints. The qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil False Claims Acts authorize a private person, known as a relator, to file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments. Under False Claims Acts, the filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action. Such cases may involve allegations around the marketing, sale, purchase, and/or dispensing of brand and/or generic pharmaceutical products or the provision of services to the pharmaceutical industry. Such complaints are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise. Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false claims, if the litigation proceeds whether or not government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters, and/or if we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters.

In fiscal 2018, we resolved potential civil claims and administrative action by entering into, among other things, a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services). The Corporate Integrity Agreement has a five-year term. Failure to comply with obligations under the Corporate Integrity Agreement could lead to monetary or other penalties.

Tax legislation or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We are a large corporation with operations in the United States and select global markets. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments, and of various foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various legislative initiatives, such as changes to the federal corporate tax rate, the repeal of last-in, first-out ("LIFO") treatment or the promulgation of state opioid taxes and fees, may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by legislation resulting from these initiatives. We believe that our historical tax positions are consistent with applicable laws, regulations, and existing precedent. In addition, U.S. federal, state and local, as well as foreign, tax laws and regulations, are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "2017 Tax Act") was enacted and contains significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Due to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to the 2017 Tax Act), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our business and intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, material adjustments to our tax estimates may impact our provision for income taxes and our earnings per share, as well as our cash flows, in the period in which any such adjustments would be made. Further, we cannot predict the impact of any efforts to change or repeal the 2017 Tax Act or enact alternative legislation by the incoming presidential administration or the next Congress.

Violations of anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and/or international trade laws to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations.

We are subject to laws concerning our business operations and marketing activities in foreign countries where we conduct business. For example, we are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"), U.S. export control and trade sanction laws, and similar anti-corruption and international trade laws in certain foreign countries, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, any violation of which could create substantial liability for us and also cause a loss of reputation in the market. The FCPA generally prohibits U.S. companies and their officers, directors, employees, and intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business abroad or otherwise obtaining favorable treatment. The FCPA also requires that U.S. public companies maintain books and records that fairly and accurately reflect transactions and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. If we are found to have violated the FCPA, we may face sanctions including civil and criminal fines, disgorgement of profits, and suspension or debarment of our ability to contract with government agencies or receive export licenses. From time to time, we may face audits or investigations by one or



more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our international business activities, compliance with which could be costly and time-consuming, and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.

Risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data.

We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing data privacy regulations both in the United States and beyond that regulate the collection, use, security, processing, and transfer of personal data, including particularly the transfer of personal data between or among countries. Many of these regulations also grant rights to individuals. Many foreign data privacy regulations (including GDPR in the European Union, Brazil's new General Data Protection Law, LGPD, and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act in Canada) and certain state laws and regulations (including California's CCPA) impose requirements beyond those enacted under United States federal law including, in some instances, private rights of action. We may also face audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to our compliance with these regulations. An adverse outcome under any such investigation or audit could subject us to fines or other penalties. That or other circumstances related to our collection, use, and transfer of personal data could cause a loss of reputation in the market and/or adversely affect our business and financial position.

Other Risks

We face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, and the continued spread of COVID-19 is adversely affecting our business.

We face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, including risks related to any responses thereto by the federal or state governments as well as customers and suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, supply chains and distribution network, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable reductions in supply and demand for certain of our products and services. Further, it is possible that the manufacturers that produce the products that we distribute may experience delays or shutdowns due to COVID-19, such as from disruptions in their supply chains or in a suspension of production at their own facilities. Accordingly, we expect the continued spread of COVID-19 to adversely affect the supply of products and/or potentially disrupt our ability to deliver products to customers. Any extended disruption in our ability to service our customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.

We also face risks related to our employees' health and the impact it may have on operations. Certain of our employees have contracted COVID-19 which resulted in our decision to temporarily close, and subsequently reopen, a small number of our distribution centers in accordance with our internal protocols. We have implemented measures designed to keep our employees safe and have protocols in place to address business continuity issues at our distribution centers and other locations, but a widespread or sustained outbreak of COVID-19 at one or more locations could disrupt our ability to service our customers.

Since April 2020, COVID-19 has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. For instance, demand for certain animal health products in our MWI business declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this reduced demand may continue as customers reduce or postpone purchases viewed as discretionary. We also face risks related to a downturn in our customers' respective businesses, including the operations of our retail pharmacy and health systems customers. An economic slowdown or recession related to COVID-19 may affect our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their business on acceptable terms, which could result in reduced spending on our products and services.

Certain enterprise-wide initiatives intended to improve our operational efficiency and financial performance, such as technology initiatives related to enhancing and upgrading our information technology systems, may take longer than originally expected to complete as we focus on COVID-19-related issues. Additionally, a large portion of our employees are working remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business.

The impacts of the continued spread of COVID-19 could also cause other unpredictable events, each of which could adversely affect our business, revenue, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. For example, the continued spread of COVID-19 has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase our cost of capital and adversely affect our ability to access the capital markets. A sustained or prolonged outbreak could exacerbate the adverse impact of such events, and the impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in Item 1A to our Form 10-K, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us.



Risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze, and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from numerous distribution centers; to receive, process, and ship orders on a timely basis; to account for other product and service transactions with customers; to manage the accurate billing and collections for thousands of customers; and to process payments to suppliers. We continue to make substantial investments in data centers and information systems, including, but not limited to, the expanded implementation of our primary ERP system to integrate certain of our key business areas. Third-party service providers are also responsible for managing a portion of our information systems. To the extent our information systems are not successfully implemented or fail, or to the extent there are data center interruptions, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Our business and results of operations may also be adversely affected if a third-party service provider does not perform satisfactorily, or if the information systems are interrupted or damaged by unforeseen events, including due to the actions of third parties.

Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of cloud-based infrastructure and other services, new technologies, and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks. A failure, interruption, or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information or personal data, damage our reputation, cause loss of customers or revenue, increase our costs, result in litigation and/or regulatory action, and/or cause other losses, any of which might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations. As a result, cyber security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access remain a priority for us. Although we believe that we have robust information security procedures, controls and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.

Additionally, as discussed above in the risk factor “We face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, and the continued spread of COVID-19 is adversely affecting our business,” a large portion of our employees are working remotely. An extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks, and impair our ability to manage our business.

Our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets may become impaired, which may require us to record a further significant charge to earnings in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") require us to test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if indicators for potential impairment exist. Indicators that are considered include significant changes in performance relative to expected operating results, significant negative industry or economic trends, or a significant decline in our stock price and/or market capitalization for a sustained period of time. In addition, we periodically review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable include slower growth rates, the loss of a significant customer, or divestiture of a business or asset for below its carrying value. The testing required by GAAP involves estimates and judgments by management.

We may be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets is determined. Any such charge could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.

Natural disasters or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may not be covered by insurance.

We face environmental risks and the occurrence of one or more unexpected events, including fires, tornadoes, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, and other severe hazards or accidents in the United States or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Extreme weather, natural disasters, power outages, or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of distribution centers or outsourcing facilities, temporary or long-term disruption in the supply of products, delay in the delivery of products to our distribution centers, and/or disruption of our ability to deliver products to customers. Current or future insurance arrangements may not provide protection for costs that may arise from such events, particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination. Further, the long-term effects of climate change on general economic



conditions and the pharmaceutical distribution industry in particular are unclear, and changes in the supply, demand, or available sources of energy and the regulatory and other costs associated with energy production and delivery may affect the availability or cost of goods and services, including natural resources, necessary to run our businesses. Any long-term disruption in our ability to service our customers from one or more distribution centers or outsourcing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto contained herein.

We are one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. We deliver innovative programs and services designed to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health. We are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our customers. Our operations are comprised of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment and other operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and, therefore, have been included in Other for the purpose of our reportable segment presentation.

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services Segment

The Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. Through a number of operating businesses, the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectable pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. Additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers.

Other

Other consists of operating segments that focus on global commercialization services and animal health (MWI Animal Health or "MWI"). The operating segments that focus on global commercialization services include AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services ("ABCS") and World Courier.

MWI is a leading animal health distribution company in the United States and in the United Kingdom. MWI sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. Additionally, MWI offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers. ABCS, through a number of operating businesses, provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that range from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. World Courier, which operates in over 50 countries, is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry.



Executive Summary

This executive summary provides highlights from the results of operations that follow:

•

In March 2020, the World Health Organization ("WHO") declared a global pandemic attributable to the outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19. In connection with the mitigation and containment procedures recommended by the WHO and imposed by federal, state, and local governmental authorities, we implemented measures designed to keep our employees safe and address business continuity issues at our distribution centers and other locations. We continue to evaluate and plan for the potential effects of a prolonged disruption and the related impacts on our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows (refer to our COVID-19 risk factor in Item 1A. Risk Factors on page 8);

•

Revenue increased 5.7% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the revenue growth of our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment;

•

Total gross profit increased 1.0% and was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services and Other and was offset in part by lower gains from antitrust litigation settlements, last-in, first-out ("LIFO") expense in comparison to a LIFO credit in the prior fiscal year, and an estimated assessment related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act ("OSA") compared to a reversal of a previously-estimated assessment related to the OSA. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services' gross profit increased 3.8% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the strong increase in specialty product sales. Gross profit in Other increased 6.5% from the prior fiscal year due to growth at World Courier, MWI, and ABCS;

•

Distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 3.9% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in operating costs to support our revenue growth;

•

Employee severance, litigation, and other increased $6.5 billion due to a legal accrual for litigation relating the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications. We are

currently in advanced discussions, which are ongoing, with the states and various plaintiffs’ representatives that would be necessary to reach a global settlement of the

Multidistrict Litigation ("MDL")

and other related state-court litigation brought by certain state and local governmental entities to be paid over 18 years in which our

payment would be $6.5 billion assuming all parties participate. A portion of this amount relating to plaintiff attorney fees would be payable over a shorter time period.

While a global settlement remains subject to contingencies that could impact whether the parties ultimately decide to move forward, we believe a global settlement is probable and our loss related thereto can be reasonably estimated as of September 30, 2020;

•

Operating income decreased in the current fiscal year primarily due to the $6.6 billion legal accrual in connection with opioid lawsuits, offset in part by an increase in segment operating income, a lower impairment charge relating to PharMEDium's assets, and a decline in depreciation and amortization;

•

Our effective tax rates were 35.8% and 11.7% in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate due to our operating loss, the tax benefits associated with our decision to permanently exit the PharMEDium compounding business, Swiss Tax Reform, the CARES Act, and other discrete items (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and offset in part by the tax impact of the portion of the opioid legal accrual that is not expected to be tax deductible. Our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the $570.0 million impairment of PharMEDium's assets (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and legal settlements, which changed the mix of domestic and international income. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was also impacted by a $37.0 million decrease to the Company's transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the "2017 Tax Act").



Results of Operations

Year ended September 30, 2020 compared to the Year ended September 30, 2019

Revenue

We currently expect our revenue growth percentage to be in the mid-single digits in fiscal 2021. Our future revenue growth will continue to be affected by various factors, such as industry growth trends, including drug utilization, the introduction of new, innovative brand therapies, the likely increase in the number of generic drugs and biosimilars that will be available over the next few years as a result of the expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers and the rate of conversion from brand products to those generic drugs and biosimilars, price inflation and price deflation, general economic conditions in the United States, competition within the industry, customer consolidation, changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased downward pressure on government and other third-party reimbursement rates to our customers, changes in federal government rules and regulations, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (See Risk Factor -

We face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, and the continued spread of COVID-19 is adversely affecting our business).

Revenue increased by 5.7% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the revenue growth of our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment.

The Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment grew its revenue by 5.6%, or $9.7 billion, from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to the organic growth of some of its largest customers, continued strong increased specialty pharmaceutical product sales (which generally have higher selling prices), and overall market growth principally driven by unit volume growth and, to a lesser extent, inflationary increases in brand drugs.

More specifically, the increase in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was largely attributable to the following (in billions):

Revenue in Other increased 9.6% from the prior fiscal year due to growth at all three operating segments: ABCS, MWI, and World Courier.

A number of our contracts with customers, including group purchasing organizations, are typically subject to expiration each year. We may lose a significant customer if an existing contract with such customer expires without being extended, renewed, or replaced. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, no significant contracts expired. Over the next twelve months, there are no significant contracts scheduled to expire. Additionally, from time to time, significant contracts may be terminated in accordance with their terms or extended, renewed, or replaced prior to their expiration dates. If those contracts are extended, renewed, or replaced at less favorable terms, they may also negatively impact our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.



Gross Profit

Gross profit increased 1.0%, or $53.6 million, from the prior fiscal year. Gross profit in the current fiscal year was favorably impacted by increases in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services and Other and lower PharMEDium remediation costs, and was offset in part by lower gains from antitrust litigation settlements, LIFO expense in comparison to a LIFO credit in the prior fiscal year, and an estimated assessment related to the New York State OSA compared to a reversal of a previously-estimated assessment related to the OSA (see below).

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services gross profit increased 3.8%, or $141.1 million, from the prior fiscal year due to the strong increase in specialty product sales. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services gross profit margin of 2.10% in the current fiscal year decreased 3 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased sales to our larger customers, which typically have lower gross profit margins.

Gross profit in Other increased 6.5%, or $85.4 million, from the prior fiscal year due to growth at World Courier, MWI, and ABCS. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in Other of 18.60% in the current fiscal year decreased from 19.13% in the prior fiscal year.

We recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $9.1 million and $145.9 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold (see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Our cost of goods sold includes a LIFO provision that is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors may have a material impact to our annual LIFO provision. The LIFO expense in the current fiscal year was primarily driven by lower generic deflation, offset in part by a higher generic inventory mix in comparison to the prior fiscal year.

We incurred remediation costs in connection with the suspended production activities at PharMEDium. We also incurred shutdown costs in connection with permanently exiting the PharMEDium compounding business.

New York State ("NYS") enacted the OSA, which went into effect on July 1, 2018. The OSA established an annual $100 million Opioid Stewardship Fund (the "Fund") and required manufacturers, distributors, and importers licensed in NYS to ratably source the Fund. The ratable share of the assessment for each licensee was to be based upon opioids sold or distributed to or within NYS. In September 2018, we accrued $22.0 million as an estimate of our liability under the OSA for the period from January 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018. In December 2018, the OSA was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and, as a result, we reversed the $22.0 million accrual in the quarter ended December 31, 2018. In September 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court’s decision, and, as a result, we accrued $14.8 million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 as we revised our estimated liability for the 2017 and 2018 calendar years.



Operating Expenses

Distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 3.9%, or $103.7 million, from the prior fiscal year. The increase from the prior fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in operating costs to support our revenue growth and costs incurred in connection with permanently exiting the PharMEDium compounding business, such as contract termination fees, offset in part by operational synergies realized from the integration of H.D. Smith within Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. As a percentage of revenue, distribution, selling, and administrative expenses were 1.46% in the current fiscal year, and represents a 2-basis point decrease compared to the prior fiscal year.

Depreciation expense decreased 5.0% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the reduction of H.D. Smith depreciable assets in connection with the integration of its operations. Amortization expense decreased 33.8% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the fiscal 2020 and 2019 impairments of PharMEDium intangible assets.

Employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 included a $6.6 billion legal accrual (see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and $115.4 million of litigation costs that related to legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations, $34.4 million of severance costs primarily related to position eliminations resulting from our decision to permanently exit the PharMEDium compounding business, $38.0 million related to our business transformation efforts, and $12.6 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs and other restructuring initiatives.

Employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 included $34.1 million of severance costs primarily related to PharMEDium restructuring activities, position eliminations resulting from our business transformation efforts and the integration of H.D. Smith, and restructuring activities related to our consulting business, $185.1 million of litigation costs that consisted of legal settlements totaling $116.7 million and legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations, $55.4 million related to our business transformation efforts, $43.2 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs (primarily related to the integration of H.D. Smith), and $12.6 million of other restructuring initiatives.

We recorded a $361.7 million impairment of PharMEDium's assets in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and a $570.0 million impairment of PharMEDium's assets in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).



Operating Income

Segment operating income is evaluated before gain from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO (expense) credit; PharMEDium remediation costs; PharMEDium shutdown costs; New York State Opioid Stewardship Act; contingent consideration adjustment; acquisition-related intangibles amortization; employee severance, litigation, and other; and impairment of PharMEDium assets.

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services operating income increased 8.1%, or $135.8 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gross profit, as noted above. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services operating income margin was 0.99% and represented an increase of 2 basis points compared to the prior fiscal year.

Operating income in Other increased 5.1%, or $19.5 million, from the prior fiscal year due to the increase in gross profit and was offset in part by an increase in operating expenses, primarily warehousing costs (including incremental COVID-19 expenses) and freight costs.

One of our non-wholly-owned subsidiaries, Profarma, which we consolidate based on certain governance rights (see Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), adjusted its previous estimate of contingent consideration related to the purchase price of one of its prior business acquisitions.

We recorded a $13.7 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in Other (Income) Loss in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.

Interest expense, net and the respective weighted average interest rates were as follows:

Interest expense, net decreased 12.6%, or $19.9 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in interest expense resulting from the adoption of the new lease accounting standard. Prior to October 1, 2019, we recognized interest expense associated with financing obligations in connection with lease construction assets (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Upon adoption of the new lease standard as of October 1, 2019, we began recognizing rent expense related to these leases in Distribution, Selling, and Administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Interest income was lower in the current fiscal year as a result of a decline in investment interest rates, which was offset in part by a $1.0 billion increase in average invested cash balances compared to the prior fiscal year.

Our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net borrowings, interest rates, amendments to our current borrowing facilities, and strategic decisions to deploy our invested cash.



Our effective tax rates were 35.8% and 11.7% in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was higher than the U.S. statutory rate due to our operating loss, the tax benefits associated with our decision to permanently exit the PharMEDium compounding business, Swiss Tax Reform, the CARES Act, and other discrete items (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and offset in part by the tax impact of the portion of the opioid legal accrual that is not expected to be tax deductible. Our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the $570.0 million impairment of PharMEDium's assets (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and legal settlements, which changed the mix of domestic and international income. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was also impacted by a $37.0 million decrease to the Company's transition tax related to the 2017 Tax Act.

Net income attributable to AmerisourceBergen and diluted earnings per share were significantly lower in the current fiscal year primarily due to the legal accrual recognized in connection with opioid lawsuits.

Year ended September 30, 2019 compared to the Year ended September 30, 2018

Revenue

Revenue increased by 6.9% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the revenue growth of our Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment.

The Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment grew its revenue by 6.9%, or by $11.1 billion, primarily due to the organic growth of some of its largest customers, continued strong increased specialty pharmaceutical product sales (which generally have higher selling prices), the impact of business combinations, and overall market growth principally driven by unit volume growth and, to a lesser extent, inflationary increases in brand drugs.

More specifically, the increase in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment revenue was largely attributable to the following (in billions):

Revenue in Other increased 8.5% from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to ABCS's growth in its Canadian operations, growth at MWI, growth at World Courier, and the January 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in Brazil.



Gross Profit

Gross profit increased 11.4%, or $526.0 million, from the prior fiscal year. Gross profit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019

was favorably impacted primarily by the increase in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, the increase in gross profit in Other, an increase in gains from antitrust litigation settlements, the LIFO credit in the current year in comparison to a LIFO expense in the prior year, and the reversal of a previously-estimated assessment related to the New York State Opioid Stewardship Act.

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services gross profit increased 6.2%, or $216.0 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in revenue largely due to strong specialty product sales, the January 2018 consolidation of Profarma, and the January 2018 acquisition of H.D. Smith and was negatively impacted by our pharmaceutical compounding operations as production at our Memphis facility had been suspended since December 2017. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services gross profit margin of 2.13% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 remained relatively flat compared to the prior fiscal year.

Gross profit in Other increased 4.3%, or $53.7 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to growth at World Courier and MWI, the January 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in Brazil, and ABCS's growth in its Canadian operations. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit margin in Other of 19.13% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 decreased from 19.90% in the prior fiscal year.

We recognized gains from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers of $145.9 million and $35.9 million during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold (see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Operating Expenses

Distribution, selling, and administrative expenses increased 8.3%, or $203.2 million, from the prior fiscal year. As a  percentage of revenue, distribution, selling, and administrative expenses were 1.48% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, and represents a 2-basis point increase compared to the prior fiscal year. Pharmaceutical Distribution Services' segment expenses increased by 10.2% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to an increase in costs to support revenue growth, the January 2018 consolidation of Profarma, and the January 2018 acquisition of H.D. Smith. Distribution, selling, and administrative expenses in Other increased by 2.7% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 due to an increase in costs to support revenue growth at MWI and the January 2018 consolidation of the specialty joint venture in Brazil, offset in part by a reduction in distribution, selling, and administrative expenses at ABCS.

Depreciation expense increased 3.9% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the January 2018 acquisition of H.D. Smith and the January 2018 consolidation of Profarma. Amortization expense decreased 7.6% from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impairment of PharMEDium intangible assets recorded in March 2019, offset in part by the amortization of intangible assets originating from our January 2018 acquisition of H.D. Smith and the January 2018 consolidation of Profarma.



Employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 included $34.1 million of severance costs primarily related to PharMEDium restructuring activities, position eliminations resulting from our business transformation efforts and the integration of H.D. Smith, and restructuring activities related to our consulting business, $185.1 million of litigation costs that consisted of legal settlements totaling $116.7 million and legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations, $55.4 million related to our business transformation efforts, $43.2 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs (primarily related to the integration of H.D. Smith), and $12.6 million of other restructuring initiatives.

Employee severance, litigation, and other in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 included $36.7 million of severance costs primarily related to position eliminations resulting from our business transformation efforts and restructuring activities related to our consulting business, $61.5 million of litigation costs primarily related to legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations and related initiatives, $33.9 million of acquisition-related deal and integration costs (primarily related to H.D. Smith), $33.0 million related to our business transformation efforts, and $18.4 million of other restructuring initiatives.

We recorded a $570.0 million impairment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

We recorded a $59.7 million goodwill impairment charge at our Profarma reporting unit in the fiscal year September 30, 2018 in connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment.

Operating Income

Segment operating income is evaluated excluding gain from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO credit (expense); PharMEDium remediation costs; New York State Opioid Stewardship Act; acquisition-related intangibles amortization; employee severance, litigation, and other; goodwill impairment; and impairment of PharMEDium assets.

Pharmaceutical Distribution Services operating income increased 2.7%, or $44.5 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gross profit, offset in part by an increase in operating expenses. As a percentage of revenue, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services operating income margin decreased 4 basis points from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a lower contribution from our pharmaceutical compounding operations.

Operating income in Other increased 7.2%, or $25.6 million, from the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in gross profit, offset in part by an increase in operating expenses.

We recorded a $13.7 million gain on the sale of an equity investment in Other (Income) Loss in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019.

We recorded a $30.0 million impairment on a non-customer note receivable related to a start-up venture in Other (Income) Loss in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.



Interest expense, net and the respective weighted average interest rates were as follows:

Interest expense, net decreased 9.7%, or $16.9 million, from the prior fiscal year. The decrease in interest expense, net from the prior fiscal year was due to an increase in interest income due to a $752 million increase in our average invested cash balance during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 and an increase in investment interest rates, offset in part by an increase in interest expense due to the December 2017 issuance of senior notes to finance our January 2018 acquisition of H.D. Smith and the January 2018 consolidation of Profarma's debt and related interest expense.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a $42.3 million loss in connection with the January 2018 consolidations of Profarma and the specialty joint venture in Brazil and a $23.8 million loss on the early retirement of our $400 million of 4.875% senior notes that were due in 2019. The loss on the early retirement of the debt included a $22.3 million prepayment premium and $1.5 million of an unamortized debt discount and unamortized debt issuance costs.

Our effective tax rates were 11.7% and (37.2)% in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was primarily impacted by the $570.0 million impairment of PharMEDium assets (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and legal settlements, which changed the mix of domestic and international income. The effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was also impacted by a $37.0 million decrease to the Company's transition tax related to the 2017 Tax Act. Our effective tax rate in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 was primarily impacted by the effect of 2017 Tax Act. Our total income tax benefit in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 of $438.5 million reflects $612.6 million of tax benefits recognized and a reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, both resulting from the 2017 Tax Act. Additionally, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, a portion of a 2017 legal settlement charge was determined to be deductible, which favorably impacted our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018. Our effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were also favorably impacted by the Company's international businesses in Switzerland and Ireland, which have lower income tax rates, and the benefit from stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting.

Net income and earnings per share were significantly lower in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 primarily due to the $570.0 million impairment of PharMEDium assets and the significant income tax benefit recognized in the prior fiscal year as a result of the 2017 Tax Act.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Critical accounting policies are those policies that involve accounting estimates and assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management's judgment. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management believes are the most dependent upon the application of estimates and assumptions. For a complete list of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Allowances for Returns and Doubtful Accounts

Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for customer sales returns and an allowance for doubtful accounts. Our customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. We record an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical customer return trends. The allowance for returns as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 was $1,344.6 million and $1,147.5 million, respectively.

In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, we consider a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and our customers' financial strength, credit standing, payment and default history, and macroeconomic conditions. Changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables. Each of our business units performs



ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based upon historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. We write off balances against the reserves when collectability is deemed remote. Each business unit performs formal, documented reviews of the allowance at least quarterly, and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly. There were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. The bad debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts, net of write-offs, recoveries, and other adjustments.

Bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $11.9 million, $25.2 million, and $16.7 million, respectively. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2020 allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the provision on accounts receivable of approximately $13.9 million. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $72.7 million and $76.4 million as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Schedule II of this Form 10-K sets forth a rollforward of allowances for returns and doubtful accounts.

Business Combinations

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed upon the acquisition or consolidation of a business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price allocated to goodwill. We engage third-party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates, and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based upon historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include, but are not limited to: discount rates and expected future cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships, trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur, which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions or estimates.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. We identify our reporting units based upon our management reporting structure, beginning with our operating segments. We aggregate two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. We evaluate whether the components within our operating segments have similar economic characteristics, which include the similarity of long-term gross margins, the nature of the components' products, services, and production processes, the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers, and the components' regulatory environment. Our reporting units include Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, Profarma, ABCS, World Courier, and MWI.

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of these impairment tests, we can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Such qualitative factors can include, among other, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events. If we conclude based on our qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a quantitative analysis. We elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, with the exception of our testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in the MWI and the Profarma reporting units. We elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, with the exception of our testing in the Profarma reporting unit. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we elected to bypass performing the qualitative assessment and went directly to performing our annual quantitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

When performing a quantitative impairment assessment, we utilize an income-based approach to value our reporting units, with the exception of the Profarma reporting unit, the fair value of which is based upon its publicly-traded stock price, plus an estimated control premium. The income-based approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. We generally



believe that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of our reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires us to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements, which are based upon our long-range plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity, including a risk premium. While we use the best available information to prepare our cash flows and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows and/or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, our overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged.

The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (certain trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. We estimate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. We believe the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinite-lived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.

We completed our required annual impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018. We recorded a goodwill impairment of $59.7 million in our Profarma reporting unit in connection with our fiscal 2018 annual impairment test. No goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. No indefinite-lived intangible impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

We perform a recoverability assessment of our long-lived assets when impairment indicators are present.

After U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") inspections of PharMEDium's compounding facilities, we voluntarily suspended production activities in December 2017 at its largest compounding facility located in Memphis, Tennessee pending execution of certain remedial measures.

As a result of the suspension of production activities at PharMEDium's compounding facility located in Memphis, Tennessee and the regulatory matters, we performed a recoverability assessment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets and recorded a $570.0 million impairment loss in the quarter ended March 31, 2019 for the amount that the carrying value of the PharMEDium asset group exceeded its fair value. Prior to the impairment, the carrying value of the asset group was $792 million. The fair value of the asset group was $222 million as of March 31, 2019. The PharMEDium asset group was included in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of PharMEDium's asset group included (i) a 15% discount rate, which contemplated a higher risk at PharMEDium; (ii) the period in which PharMEDium will resume production at or near capacity; and (iii) the estimated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins when considering the likelihood of higher operating and compliance costs. We believed that our fair value assumptions were representative of market participant assumptions; however, the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value and measure the related impairment were inherently uncertain and included assumptions that differed from actual results in future periods (see below). This represents a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. We allocated $522.1 million of the impairment to finite-lived intangibles ($420.8 million of customer relationships, $79.9 million of a trade name, and $21.4 million of software technology) and $47.9 million of the impairment to property and equipment.

We updated our recoverability assessment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets as of September 30, 2019, and we concluded that PharMEDium’s long-lived assets were recoverable as of September 30, 2019.

As a result of the continued suspension of the production activities at PharMEDium's compounding facility located in Memphis, Tennessee, certain regulatory matters, ongoing operational challenges, and lower-than-expected operating results, we updated our recoverability assessment of PharMEDium’s long-lived assets as of December 31, 2019. The recoverability assessment was based upon comparing PharMEDium's forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its asset group. Using forecasted undiscounted cash flows that were based on the weighted average of multiple strategic alternatives, we concluded that the carrying value of the PharMEDium long-lived asset group was not recoverable as of December 31, 2019. The forecasted undiscounted cash flows as of December 31, 2019 were lower than the forecasted undiscounted cash flows as of September 30, 2019 due to a change in weighting of multiple strategic alternatives and lower operating results in the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to expectations. We then performed an impairment test by comparing the PharMEDium asset group's fair value of $145 million to its carrying value, which resulted in a $138.0 million impairment loss in the three months ended December 31, 2019. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of PharMEDium's asset group included (i) a 17% discount rate, which contemplated a higher risk at PharMEDium; (ii) the period in which PharMEDium will resume production at or near capacity; and (iii) the estimated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins when considering the likelihood of higher operating and compliance costs. We believed



that our fair value assumptions were representative of market participant assumptions; however, the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value and measure the related impairment were inherently uncertain and included assumptions that differed from actual results in future periods (see below). This represented a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. We allocated $123.2 million of the impairment to finite-lived intangibles, $11.6 million of the impairment to property and equipment, and $3.2 million to ROU assets.

In January 2020, we decided to permanently exit the PharMEDium compounding business, and, as a result, we ceased all commercial and administrative operations related to this business in fiscal 2020. The decision to permanently exit the PharMEDium business was due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, ongoing operational, regulatory, and commercial challenges, such as PharMEDium's decision in January 2020 to suspend production at the compounding facility in New Jersey pending facility upgrades related to the air handling and filtration systems. In connection with the decision to exit the PharMEDium business, we recorded an impairment of PharMEDium's assets of $223.7 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020, which included impairments of the remaining finite-lived intangible assets and the majority of the remaining tangible assets.

Income Taxes

Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions reflect management's assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for tax purposes.

We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Expiring carryforwards and the required valuation allowances are adjusted annually. After application of the valuation allowances described above, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other deferred income tax assets described above.

We prepare and file tax returns based upon our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based upon these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business, our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation, regulation, and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions' tax court systems. Significant judgment is exercised in applying complex tax laws and regulations across multiple global jurisdictions where we conduct our operations. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position.

We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances. However, others applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued.

The significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year. If any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on income before income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by $52.9 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.

For a complete discussion of the impact of the CARES Act, the PharMEDium worthless stock deduction, Swiss Tax Reform, the legal accrual related to opioid litigation, and the 2017 Tax Act, refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 70% and 75% of our inventories as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, has been determined using the LIFO method. If we had used the first-in, first-out method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $1,519.2 million and $1,511.8 million higher than the amounts reported as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We recorded LIFO expenses of $7.4 million and $67.3 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2018, respectively. We recorded a LIFO credit of $22.5 million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. The annual LIFO provision is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to our annual LIFO provision.



Loss Contingencies

In the ordinary course of business, we become involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, stockholder demands, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. Significant damages or penalties may be sought in some matters, and some matters may require years to resolve. We record a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency and whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can made in the footnotes to our financial statements. We review all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Among the loss contingencies we considered in accordance with the foregoing in connection with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements were the opioid matters described in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

The following illustrates our debt structure as of September 30, 2020, including availability under the multi-currency revolving credit facility, the receivables securitization facility, the revolving credit note, and the overdraft facility:

Our operating results have generated cash flows, which, together with availability under our debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, have provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and purchases of shares of our common stock.

Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the repayment of debt, fund the payment of interest on debt, fund purchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance acquisitions, and fund capital expenditures and routine growth and expansion through new business opportunities. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including the opioid litigation payments that are expected to be made over 18 years (see below).

As discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, with regard to litigation relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications, we recorded a $6.6 billion ($5.5 billion, net of an income tax benefit) charge. We are in advanced discussions, which are ongoing, to reach a global settlement of the MDL and related state-court litigation brought by certain state and local governmental entities in which our payment would be over 18 years to resolve cases currently filed and that could be filed by states, counties, municipalities, and other government entities.

A portion of this amount relating to plaintiff attorney fees would be payable over a shorter time period. The



aforementioned litigation accrual has not and is not expected to have an impact on our compliance with our debt covenants or our ability to pay dividends.

As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, our cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $675.9 million and $826.8 million, respectively, and are generally based in U.S. dollar denominated holdings. We have the ability to repatriate the majority of our cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries without incurring significant additional taxes upon repatriation.

We have increased seasonal needs related to our inventory build during the December and March quarters that, depending on our cash balance, may require the use of our credit facilities to fund short-term capital needs. Our cash balance in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 needed to be supplemented by intra-period credit facility borrowings to cover short-term working capital needs. The largest amount of intra-period borrowings under our revolving and securitization credit facilities that was outstanding at any one time during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was $39.6 million and $240.6 million, respectively. We had $117.4 million, $606.0 million, and $25,115.3 million of cumulative intra-period borrowings that were repaid under our credit facilities during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

In May 2020, we issued $500 million of 2.80% senior notes due May 15, 2030 (the "2030 Notes"). The 2030 Notes were sold at 99.71% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 2.81%. Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, commencing on November 15, 2020.

We used the proceeds from the 2030 Notes to finance the early retirement of the $500 million of 3.50% senior notes that were due in 2021 and made a $21.4 million prepayment premium in connection with this early retirement.

In December 2017, we issued $750 million of 3.45% senior notes due December 15, 2027 (the "2027 Notes") and $500 million of 4.30% senior notes due December 15, 2047 ("the 2047 Notes"). The 2027 Notes were sold at 99.76% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 3.48%. The 2047 Notes were sold at 99.51% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 4.33%. Interest on the 2027 Notes and the 2047 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears and commenced on June 15, 2018.

We used the proceeds from the 2027 Notes and the 2047 Notes to finance the early retirement of our $400 million of 4.875% senior notes that were due in 2019, including the payment of a $22.3 million prepayment premium, and to finance the acquisition of H.D. Smith, which was completed in January 2018.

We have a $1.4 billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility ("Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility") with a syndicate of lenders, which is scheduled to expire in September 2024. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based upon our debt rating and ranges from 70 basis points to 112.5 basis points over CDOR/LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (91 basis points over CDOR/LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee as of September 30, 2020) and from 0 basis points to 12.5 basis points over the alternate base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable. We pay facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based upon our debt rating, ranging from 5 basis points to 12.5 basis points, annually, of the total commitment (9 basis points as of September 30, 2020). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which we were compliant as of September 30, 2020.

We have a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $1.4 billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase our borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by our Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were no borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.

We have a $1,450 million receivables securitization facility ("Receivables Securitization Facility"), which is scheduled to expire in September 2022. We have available to us an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are based upon prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or LIBOR plus a program fee. We pay a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, with which we were compliant as of September 30, 2020.



In April 2019, we elected to repay $150.0 million of our outstanding Receivables Securitization Facility balance prior to the scheduled maturity date.

In connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation and a specialty distribution subsidiary sell on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a wholly-owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. As sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. We use the facility as a financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources.

We have an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to us pursuant to a revolving credit note ("Revolving Credit Note"). The Revolving Credit Note provides us with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $75 million. The Revolving Credit Note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or us at any time without prior notice. We also have a £30 million uncommitted U.K. overdraft facility ("Overdraft Facility"), which expires in February 2021, to fund short-term, normal trading cycle fluctuations related to our MWI business.

In October 2018, we refinanced $400 million of outstanding term loans by issuing a new $400 million variable-rate term loan ("October 2018 Term Loan"), which matures in October 2020. The October 2018 Term Loan bears interest at a rate equal to a base rate or LIBOR, plus a margin of 65 basis points. The October 2018 Term Loan contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, with which we were compliant as of September 30, 2020.

In October 2020, we repaid the $400 million October 2018 Term Loan that became due.

In addition to the 2027 Notes, the 2030 Notes, and the 2047 Notes, we have $500 million of 3.40% senior notes due May 15, 2024, $500 million of 3.25% senior notes due March 1, 2025, and $500 million of 4.25% senior notes due March 1, 2045 (collectively, the "Notes"). Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears.

Nonrecourse debt is comprised of short-term and long-term debt belonging to the Brazil subsidiaries and is repaid solely from the Brazil subsidiaries' cash flows and such debt agreements provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts, and cash flows of the Brazil subsidiaries.

In November 2016, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion in shares of our common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we purchased $663.1 million of our common stock under this program, which included $24.0 million of September 2018 purchases that cash settled in October 2018. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we purchased $125.8 million of our common stock under this program, which excluded $24.0 million of September 2018 purchases that cash settled in October 2018, to complete our authorization under this program.

In October 2018, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $1.0 billion of our shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we purchased $538.9 million of our common stock under this program, which included $14.8 million of September 2019 purchases that cash settled in October 2019. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, we purchased $405.6 million of our common stock, which excluded $14.8 million of September 2019 purchases that cash settled in October 2019. As of September 30, 2020, we had $55.5 million of availability remaining under this program.

In May 2020, our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program allowing us to purchase up to $500 of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions.

The following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancellable operating leases, and minimum payments on our other commitments as of September 30, 2020:



The 2017 Tax Act required a one-time transition tax to be recognized on historical foreign earnings and profits. We currently estimate that our liability related to the transition tax is $182.6 million, net of overpayments and tax credits, as of September 30, 2020, which is payable in installments over a six-year period commencing in January 2021. The transition tax commitment is included in "Other Commitments" in the above table.

Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $498.3 million (including interest and penalties) as of September 30, 2020. Included in this balance is $371.5 million for an uncertain tax position related to the $6.6 billion legal accrual for litigation related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications, as disclosed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. As of September 30, 2020, a settlement has not been reached, and, therefore, we applied significant judgment in estimating the ultimate amount of the opioid litigation settlement that would be deductible for U.S. federal and state purposes. In estimating the amount that would ultimately be deductible, we considered prior U.S. tax case law, the amount and character of the damages sought in the opioid litigation, the inherent uncertainty related to litigation of this nature and magnitude, and other relevant factors. While we believe that our estimate of the uncertain tax position appropriately reflects these considerations, it is reasonably possible that the uncertain tax position recognized as of September 30, 2020 may be revised in future periods as the settlement with the various plaintiffs is finalized. The remaining amount of the liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken in our tax returns or expect to take in future tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, our operating activities provided cash of $2,207.0 million and $2,344.0 million, respectively. Cash provided by operations in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was principally the result of an increase in the accrued litigation liability of $6,198.9 million, an increase in accounts payable of $3,300.8 million, and an increase in accrued expenses of $524.0 million, largely offset in part by a net loss of $3,399.6 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $1,629.0 million, an increase in inventories of $1,621.1 million, non-cash items of $662.4 million, and an increase in income taxes receivable of $482.6 million. The increases in the accrued litigation liability and accrued expenses were primarily due to a legal accrual for litigation relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications (see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the increase in inventories and the timing of scheduled payments to suppliers. The increase in accounts receivable was the result of our revenue growth and the timing of payments from our customers. The increase in inventories was due to an increase in business volume. Non-cash items were comprised primarily of a deferred income tax benefit of $1,545.0 million primarily related to a legal accrual in connection with opioid lawsuits and Swiss Tax Reform, offset in part by a $361.7 million impairment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $290.7 million of depreciation expense, and $117.3 million of amortization expense. The increase in income taxes receivable was the result of a benefit recorded in connection with certain discrete items (see Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Deterioration of general economic conditions, among other factors, could adversely affect the number of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and, therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. In addition, volatility in financial markets may also negatively impact our customers' ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash flow from operations.

We use days sales outstanding, days inventory on hand, and days payable outstanding to evaluate our working capital performance. The below financial metrics are calculated based upon an annual average and can be impacted by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements, which can vary significantly depending upon the day of the week in which the month ends.

Our cash flows from operating activities can vary significantly from period to period based upon fluctuations in our period end working capital. Additionally, any changes to payment terms with a significant customer or manufacturer supplier could have a material impact to our cash flows from operations. Operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 included $150.7 million of interest payments and $139.4 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 included $167.4 million of interest payments and $117.7 million of income tax payments, net of refunds. Operating cash flows during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 included $162.1 million of interest payments and $104.0 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.



During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, our operating activities provided cash of $2,344.0 million and $1,411.4 million, respectively. Cash provided by operations in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 was principally the result of an increase in accounts payable of $1,561.0 million, non-cash items of $1,120.7 million, and net income of $854.1 million, offset in part by an increase in accounts receivable of $1,241.9 million. The increase in accounts payable was primarily driven by the timing of scheduled payments to suppliers. Non-cash items were comprised primarily of a $570 million impairment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets (see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), $321.1 million of depreciation expense, and $176.4 million of amortization expense. The increase in accounts receivable was the result of our revenue growth and the timing of payments from our customers.

Capital expenditures in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $369.7 million, $310.2 million, and $336.4 million, respectively. Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2020 included investments in various technology initiatives, including costs related to enhancing and upgrading our primary information technology operating systems. Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 included costs associated with the construction of a new support facility and technology initiatives, including costs related to enhancing and upgrading our information technology systems. Significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 included technology initiatives, including costs related to enhancing and upgrading our information technology systems and costs associated with expanding distribution capacity.

We currently expect to spend approximately $400 million for capital expenditures during fiscal 2021. Larger 2021 capital expenditures will include investments related to various technology initiatives and new facilities.

We acquired businesses to support our animal health business for $54.0 million and $70.0 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, we acquired H.D. Smith, the largest independent pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United States, for $815.0 million. In addition, we made incremental investments in Brazil totaling $78.1 million. The cash used for the above investments was offset by $179.6 million of cash consolidated in connection with the Brazil investments (see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).

Net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 principally related to $420.4 million in purchases of our common stock, and $343.6 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock.

Net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 principally related to $674.0 million in purchases of our common stock and $339.0 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock.

Net cash used in financing activities in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 principally included the early retirement of the $400 million of 4.875% senior notes, $639.2 million in purchases of our common stock, and $333.0 million in cash dividends paid on our common stock, offset in part by the issuance of $750.0 million of 3.45% senior notes and $500 million of 4.3% senior notes.

Our board of directors approved the following quarterly dividend increases:

We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, and other factors.

Market Risk

We have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital requirements. We had $0.8 billion of variable-rate debt outstanding as of September 30, 2020. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available in the combinations we want and/or on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial instruments in effect as of September 30, 2020.

We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash equivalents. We had $4,597.7 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2020. The unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in



interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every $100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10-basis point decrease in interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million.

We have minimal exposure to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the Euro, the U.K. Pound Sterling, the Canadian Dollar, and the Brazilian Real. Revenue from our foreign operations is approximately two percent of our consolidated revenue. We may utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange rates. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure, but not for speculative or trading purposes.

ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AmerisourceBergen Corporation

Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AmerisourceBergen Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at September 30, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated November 19, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Critical Audit Matters

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Legal Matters and Contingencies - Opioid Lawsuits

Description of the Matter

As discussed in Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company is involved in a significant number of lawsuits with counties, municipalities, and other governmental entities in a majority of U.S. states and Puerto Rico, as well as several tribes relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications (“opioid litigation”). The Company recognizes a liability for those legal contingencies for which it is probable that a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount is reasonably estimable. The Company has recognized a $6.6 billion ($5.5 billion after tax) charge related to the opioid litigation for the year ended September 30, 2020 and has disclosed that it is unable to estimate the range of possible loss in excess of the amount accrued. In connection with this charge, the Company recognized a related income tax benefit, which reflects an unrecognized tax benefit resulting from uncertainty in the amount that is more likely than not to be deductible for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes based in part upon the final terms and conditions of a settlement agreement. The Company used significant judgment in measuring the amount of income tax benefit that qualified for recognition and may ultimately be deductible for U.S. federal and state purposes.

Note 1.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

AmerisourceBergen Corporation and its subsidiaries, including less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in which AmerisourceBergen Corporation has a controlling financial interest (the "Company"), is one of the largest global pharmaceutical sourcing and distribution services companies, helping both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical and biotech manufacturers improve patient access to products and enhance patient care. The Company delivers innovative programs and services designed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain in both human and animal health.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying financial statements present the consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows of the Company as of the dates and for the periods indicated. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ from these estimated amounts due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. Management periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements for continued reasonableness.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-period amounts in order to conform to the current year presentation.

In March 2020, the World Health Organization ("WHO") declared a global pandemic attributable to the outbreak and continued spread of COVID-19. In connection with the mitigation and containment procedures recommended by the WHO and imposed by federal, state, and local governmental authorities, the Company implemented measures designed to keep its employees safe and address business continuity issues at its distribution centers and other locations. The Company continues to evaluate and plan for the potential effects of a prolonged disruption and the related impacts on its revenue, results of operations, and cash flows. These items include, but are not limited to, the financial condition of its customers and the realization of accounts receivable, decreased availability and demand for its products and services, and delays related to current and future projects. While the Company's operational and financial performance may be significantly impacted by COVID-19, it is not possible for the Company to predict the duration or magnitude of the outbreak and whether it could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. See Risk Factor -

We face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, and the continued spread of COVID-19 is adversely affecting our business.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)" ("ASU 2014-09"). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 605 - "Revenue Recognition" and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. ASU 2014-09 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The standard's core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Principal versus Agent Considerations" ("ASU 2016-08"), which clarified the implementation guidance for principal versus agent considerations in ASU 2014-09. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing" ("ASU 2016-10"), which amended the guidance in ASU 2014-09 related to identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The Company was required to adopt ASU 2016-08 and ASU 2016-10 with ASU 2014-09, collectively ASC 606.

The Company adopted ASC 606 as of October 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis for all open contracts as of October 1, 2018. The adoption had an immaterial impact on the Company's October 1, 2018 retained earnings and did not and will not have a material impact on the Company's revenues, results of operations, or cash flows. The Company did not record any material contract assets, contract liabilities, or deferred contract costs in its Consolidated Balance Sheet upon adoption.

The Company elected the practical expedient to expense costs to obtain a contract when incurred when the amortization period would have been one year or less. Additionally, the Company elected the practical expedients to not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it has the right to invoice for services



performed, and (iii) for contracts for which the variable consideration is allocated entirely to a wholly unsatisfied performance obligation or to a wholly unsatisfied promise to transfer a distinct good or service that forms part of a single performance obligation.

For the Company's revenue recognition policy, refer to the "Revenue Recognition" section of Note 1.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)" ("ASU 2016-02" or "ASC 842"). ASU 2016-02 aims to increase transparency and comparability across organizations by requiring lease assets and lease liabilities to be recognized on the balance sheet as well as key information to be disclosed regarding lease arrangements. ASU 2016-02 was effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years.

The Company adopted ASC 842 as of October 1, 2019 and adopted it using the modified retrospective approach. The Company elected the transition package of practical expedients provided within the amended guidance, which eliminated the requirements to reassess lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs for leases that commenced before the effective date. The Company also elected to combine lease and non-lease components and to exclude short-term leases from its consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not elect the hindsight practical expedient in determining the lease term.

In connection with the adoption of ASC 842, the Company recognized operating lease liabilities of $

562.1

million, right-of-use ("ROU") assets of $

526.3

million, and a $

35.1

million, net of tax of $

9.6

million, cumulative adjustment to retained earnings. The Company's lease liabilities were based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease commitments using the Company's incremental borrowing rates as of October 1, 2019, and the Company's ROU assets were based upon the operating lease liabilities adjusted for prepaid and deferred rents. The cumulative adjustment to retained earnings was primarily the result of derecognizing assets of $

266.0

million in Property and Equipment, Net and $

324.8

million of financing obligations in Long-Term Financing Obligation and Accrued Expenses and Other, all of which was associated with leased assets where the Company was deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. The Company finalized the impact that the amended lease guidance had on its systems, processes, and internal controls. The adoption of ASC 842 did not and will not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or cash flows.

For the Company's lease policy, refer to the "Leases" section of Note 1.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments" ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amounts. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and a modified retrospective approach is required, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company does not expect the adoption of this new accounting guidance to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes" ("ASU 2019-12"). ASU 2019-12 removes certain exceptions to the general principles in ASC 740 in order to reduce the cost and complexity of its application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with certain amendments applied on a modified retrospective basis, with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption, and others prospectively. Early adoption of this guidance is permitted, including the adoption in any interim period for public companies for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this new accounting guidance.

As of September 30, 2020, there were no other recently issued accounting standards that may have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations, or cash flows upon their adoption.

Business Combinations

The assets acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business are recorded at fair value, with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the acquired businesses are included in the Company's operating results from the dates of acquisition.



Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company sells its inventories to a large number of customers in the healthcare industry that include institutional and retail healthcare providers. Institutional healthcare providers include acute care hospitals, health systems, mail order pharmacies, long-term care and other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities, and physician offices. Retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore chains, independent community pharmacies, pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers, and veterinarians. The financial condition of the Company's customers can be affected by changes in government reimbursement policies as well as by other economic pressures in the healthcare industry.

The Company's trade accounts receivables are exposed to credit risk. Revenue from the various agreements and arrangements with the Company's largest customer in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. ("WBA"), accounted for approximately


%

of revenue and represented approximately


% of accounts receivable, net of incentives, as of September 30, 2020. Express Scripts, Inc., the Company's second largest customer in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, accounted for approximately


% of revenue and represented approximately


% of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2020. The Company generally does not require collateral for trade receivables. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, the Company considers a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry trends, and its customers' financial strength, credit standing, and payment and default history. Changes in these factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in the Company's allowance for doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by Company management as to the impact of those and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade receivables. Each of the Company's business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers' financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based upon historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. There were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods.

The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with several financial institutions. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit and, therefore, bear minimal credit risk. The Company seeks to mitigate such risks by monitoring the risk profiles of these counterparties. The Company also seeks to mitigate risk by monitoring the investment strategy of money market accounts in which it is invested, which are classified as cash equivalents.

Contingencies

Loss Contingencies:

In the ordinary course of its business, the Company becomes involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, stockholder demands, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. Significant damages or penalties may be sought from the Company in some matters, and some matters may require years for the Company to resolve. The Company records a liability when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Company also performs an assessment of the materiality of loss contingencies where a loss is either not probable or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of amounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial statements would be material, the Company provides disclosure of the loss contingency in the notes to its financial statements. The Company reviews all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made. Among the loss contingencies that the Company considered in accordance with the foregoing in connection with the preparation of the accompanying financial statements were the opioid matters described in Note 14.

Gain Contingencies:

The Company records gain contingencies when they are realized. Gains from antitrust litigation settlements are realized upon the receipt of cash and recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold because they represent a recovery of amounts historically paid to manufacturers to originally acquire the pharmaceuticals that were the subject of the antitrust litigation settlements (see Note 15).

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company records all derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value and complies with established criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships. The Company's policy prohibits it from entering into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.



Foreign Currency

When the functional currency of the Company's foreign operations is the applicable local currency, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss within Stockholders' Equity.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill arises from acquisitions or consolidations of specific operating companies and is assigned to the reporting unit in which a particular operating company resides. The Company identifies its reporting units based upon the Company's management reporting structure, beginning with its operating segments. The Company aggregates two or more components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. The Company evaluates whether the components within its operating segments have similar economic characteristics, which include the similarity of long-term gross margins, the nature of the components' products, services, and production processes, the types of customers and the methods by which products or services are delivered to customers, and the components' regulatory environment. The Company's reporting units include Pharmaceutical Distribution Services, Profarma Distribuidora de Produtos Farmacêuticos S.A. ("Profarma"), AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services ("ABCS"), World Courier, and MWI Animal Health ("MWI").

Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as certain trademarks and trade names, are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of these impairment tests, the Company can elect to perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair values of its reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets are less than the respective carrying values of those reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Such qualitative factors can include, among others, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, and relevant entity-specific events. If the Company concludes based on its qualitative assessment that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, it performs a quantitative analysis. The Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, with the exception of its testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles in the MWI and Profarma reporting units. The Company elected to perform a qualitative impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, with the exception of the its testing of goodwill in the Profarma reporting unit. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company elected to bypass performing the qualitative assessment and went directly to performing its annual quantitative assessments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires us to compare the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets to the fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further evaluation is required, and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the difference between the carrying value and the fair value is recorded as an impairment loss, the amount of which may not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.

When performing a quantitative impairment assessment, the Company utilizes an income-based approach to value its reporting units, with the exception of the Profarma reporting unit, the fair value of which is based upon its publicly-traded stock price, plus an estimated control premium. The income-based approach relies on a discounted cash flow analysis, which considers forecasted cash flows discounted at an appropriate discount rate, to determine the fair value of each reporting unit. The Company generally believes that market participants would use a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the Company's reporting units in a sale transaction. The annual goodwill impairment test requires the Company to make a number of assumptions and estimates concerning future levels of revenue growth, operating margins, depreciation, amortization, capital expenditures, and working capital requirements, which are based upon the Company's long-range plan. The discount rate is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by a market participant whose weighted average cost of capital includes both debt and equity, including a risk premium. While the Company uses the best available information to prepare its cash flows and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows and/or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. While there are always changes in assumptions to reflect changing business and market conditions, the Company's overall methodology and the population of assumptions used have remained unchanged.

The quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangibles other than goodwill (certain trademarks and trade names) consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset to the carrying value of the asset as of the impairment testing date. The Company estimates the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangibles using the relief from royalty method. The Company believes the relief from royalty method is a widely used valuation technique for such assets. The fair value derived from the relief from royalty method is measured as the discounted cash flow savings realized from owning such indefinite-lived trademarks and trade names and not having to pay a royalty for their use.



The Company completed its required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018. The Company recorded a goodwill impairment of $

59.7

million in its Profarma reporting unit in connection with its fiscal 2018 annual impairment test.

No

goodwill impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

No

indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments were recorded in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018.

Finite-lived intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The Company performs a recoverability assessment of its long-lived assets when impairment indicators are present.

After U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") inspections of PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings, Inc.'s ("PharMEDium") compounding facilities, the Company voluntarily suspended production activities in December 2017 at its largest compounding facility located in Memphis, Tennessee pending execution of certain remedial measures.

As a result of the suspension of production activities at PharMEDium's compounding facility located in Memphis, Tennessee and the regulatory matters, the Company performed a recoverability assessment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets and recorded a $

570.0

million impairment loss in the quarter ended March 31, 2019 for the amount that the carrying value of the PharMEDium asset group exceeded its fair value. Prior to the impairment, the carrying value of the asset group was $


million. The fair value of the asset group was $


million as of March 31, 2019. The PharMEDium asset group was included in the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of PharMEDium's asset group included (i) a


% discount rate, which contemplated a higher risk at PharMEDium; (ii) the period in which PharMEDium will resume production at or near capacity; and (iii) the estimated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins when considering the likelihood of higher operating and compliance costs. The Company believed that its fair value assumptions were representative of market participant assumptions; however, the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value and measure the related impairment were inherently uncertain and included assumptions that differed from actual results in future periods (see below). This represents a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. The Company allocated $

522.1

million of the impairment to finite-lived intangibles ($

420.8

million of customer relationships, $

79.9

million of a trade name, and $

21.4

million of software technology) and $

47.9

million of the impairment to property and equipment.

The Company updated its recoverability assessment of PharMEDium's long-lived assets as of September 30, 2019. The Company concluded that PharMEDium’s long-lived assets were recoverable as of September 30, 2019.

As a result of the continued suspension of the production activities at PharMEDium's compounding facility located in Memphis, Tennessee, certain regulatory matters, ongoing operational challenges, and lower-than-expected operating results, the Company updated its recoverability assessment of PharMEDium’s long-lived assets as of December 31, 2019. The recoverability assessment was based upon comparing PharMEDium's forecasted undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of its asset group. Using forecasted undiscounted cash flows that were based on the weighted average of multiple strategic alternatives, the Company concluded that the carrying value of the PharMEDium long-lived asset group was not recoverable as of December 31, 2019. The forecasted undiscounted cash flows as of December 31, 2019 were lower than the forecasted undiscounted cash flows as of September 30, 2019 due to a change in weighting of multiple strategic alternatives and lower operating results in the three months ended December 31, 2019 compared to expectations. The Company then performed an impairment test by comparing the PharMEDium asset group's fair value of $


million to its carrying value, which resulted in a $

138.0

million impairment loss in the three months ended December 31, 2019. Significant assumptions used in estimating the fair value of PharMEDium's asset group included (i) a


% discount rate, which contemplated a higher risk at PharMEDium; (ii) the period in which PharMEDium will resume production at or near capacity; and (iii) the estimated EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) margins when considering the likelihood of higher operating and compliance costs. The Company believed that its fair value assumptions were representative of market participant assumptions; however, the forecasted cash flows used to estimate fair value and measure the related impairment were inherently uncertain and included assumptions that differed from actual results in future periods (see below). This represented a Level 3 nonrecurring fair value measurement. The Company allocated $

123.2

million of the impairment to finite-lived intangibles, $

11.6

million of the impairment to property and equipment, and $

3.2

million to ROU assets.

In January 2020, the Company decided to permanently exit the PharMEDium compounding business, and, as a result, the Company ceased all commercial and administrative operations related to this business in fiscal 2020. The decision to permanently exit the PharMEDium business was due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, ongoing operational, regulatory, and commercial challenges, such as PharMEDium's decision in January 2020 to suspend production at the compounding facility in New Jersey pending facility upgrades related to the air handling and filtration systems. In connection with the decision to exit the PharMEDium business, the Company recorded an impairment of PharMEDium's assets of $

223.7

million in the three months ended March 31, 2020, which included impairments of the remaining finite-lived intangible assets and the majority of the remaining tangible assets.



Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using a method that requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of the Company's assets and liabilities (commonly known as the asset and liability method). In assessing the need to establish a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, including settlements with tax authorities or resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based upon the technical merits of the position. Tax benefits associated with uncertain tax positions that have met the recognition criteria are measured and recorded based upon the highest probable outcome that is more than 50% likely to be realized after full disclosure and resolution of a tax examination.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately


% and


% of the Company's inventories as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, has been determined using the last-in, first-out ("LIFO") method. If the Company had used the first-in, first-out method of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been approximately $

1,519.2

million and $

1,511.8

million higher than the amounts reported as of September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company recorded LIFO expense of $

7.4

million and $

67.3

million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2018, respectively, and a LIFO credit of $

22.5

million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019. The annual LIFO provision is affected by manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences, changes in inventory quantities, and product mix, many of which are difficult to predict. Changes to any of the above factors can have a material impact to the Company's annual LIFO provision.

Investments

The Company first evaluates its investments in accordance with the variable interest model to determine whether it has a controlling financial interest in an investment. This evaluation is made as of the date on which the Company makes its initial investment, and subsequent evaluations are made if the structure of the investment changes. If it has determined that an investment is a variable interest entity ("VIE"), the Company evaluates whether the VIE is required to be consolidated. When the Company holds rights that give it the power to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, combined with the obligation to absorb an entity's losses and the right to receive benefits, the Company consolidates a VIE. If it is determined that an investment is not a VIE, the Company then evaluates its investments under the voting interest model and generally consolidates investments in which it holds an ownership interest of greater than 50%. When the Company consolidates less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries, it presents its noncontrolling interest in its consolidated financial statements.

For equity securities without a readily determinable fair value, the Company uses the fair value measurement alternative and measures the securities at cost less impairment, if any, including adjustments for observable price changes in orderly transactions for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer. For investments in which the Company can exercise significant influence but does not control, it uses the equity method of accounting. The Company's share of earnings and losses is recorded in Other (Income) Loss in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company monitors its investments for impairment by considering factors such as the operating performance of the investment and current economic and market conditions.

Leases

The Company is often involved in the construction of its facilities. Prior to October 1, 2019, in certain cases, the Company made payments for certain structural components included in the lessor's construction of the leased assets, which resulted in the Company being deemed the owner of the leased assets for accounting purposes. As a result, regardless of the significance of the payments, ASC 840, Leases, defined those payments as automatic indicators of ownership and required the Company to capitalize the lessor's total project cost with a corresponding financing obligation. Upon completion of the lessor's project, the Company performed a sale-leaseback analysis pursuant to ASC 840 to determine if these assets and the related financing obligations could be derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. If the Company was deemed to have had "continuing involvement," the leased assets and the related financing obligations remained on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet and were amortized over the life of the assets and the lease term, respectively. All other leases were considered operating leases in accordance with ASC 840. Assets subject to an operating lease and the related lease payments were not recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Rent expense was recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term and was recorded in Distribution, Selling, and Administrative in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.



Subsequent to the adoption of ASC 842 on October 1, 2019, at the inception of an arrangement, the Company determines whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the facts and circumstances present. Leases are classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. At the lease commencement date, operating and finance lease liabilities and their corresponding ROU assets are recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable and, as such, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease liabilities, which is the rate incurred to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term in a similar economic environment. Certain adjustments to the ROU asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The Company does not recognize on the balance sheet leases with terms of one year or less.

The Company has operating leases that are primarily comprised of buildings, office equipment, distribution center equipment, and vehicles. Some of the Company's leases include options to extend or early terminate the lease, which are included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain to exercise and there is a significant economic incentive to exercise that option. Certain lease agreements contain provisions for future rent increases. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise fixed payments. The Company combines lease and non-lease components as a single component. Operating lease cost is recognized over the expected lease term on a straight-line basis and is recorded in Distribution, Selling, and Administrative in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. Variable lease payments, which are primarily comprised of maintenance, taxes, and other payments based on usage, are recognized when the expense is incurred. The Company's leases do not contain residual value guarantees.

Manufacturer Incentives

The Company considers fees and other incentives received from its suppliers relating to the purchase or distribution of inventory to represent product discounts, and, as a result, they are recognized within cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related inventory.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from


to


years for buildings and improvements and from


to


years for machinery, equipment, and other. The costs of repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

The Company capitalizes project costs relating to computer software developed or obtained for internal use when the activities related to the project reach the application development stage. Costs that are associated with preliminary stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other post-implementation stage activities are expensed as they are incurred. Software development costs are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which range from


to


years.

Revenue Recognition

The Company's revenues are primarily generated from the distribution of pharmaceutical products. The Company also generates revenues from global commercialization services, which include clinical trial support, post-approval and commercialization support, and global specialty transportation and logistics for the biopharmaceutical industry. See Note 16 for the Company's disaggregated revenue.

The Company recognizes revenue related to the distribution of products at a point in time when title and control transfers to customers and there is no further obligation to provide services related to such products. Service revenue is recognized over the period that services are provided to the customer. The Company is generally the principal in a transaction; therefore, revenue is primarily recorded on a gross basis. When the Company is the principal in a transaction, it has determined that it controls the ability to direct the use of the product or service prior to the transfer to a customer, it is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the product or service to its customer, it has discretion in establishing pricing, and it controls the relationship with the customer. Revenue is recognized at the amount of consideration expected to be received. For the distribution business, revenue is primarily generated from a contract related to a confirmed purchase order with a customer in a distribution arrangement and is net of estimated sales returns and allowances, other customer incentives, and sales tax.

The Company's customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. The Company records an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer based upon historical return trends. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company's accrual for estimated customer sales returns was $

1,344.7

million and $

1,147.5

million, respectively.



Share-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for the compensation cost of all share-based payments at fair value. The Company estimates the fair value of option grants using a binomial option pricing model. The fair value of restricted stock units and performance stock units is based upon the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock.

Share-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period within Distribution, Selling, and Administrative in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to correspond with the same line item as the cash compensation paid to employees. Compensation expense associated with nonvested performance stock units is dependent upon the Company's periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and its estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued.

The income tax effects of awards are recognized when the awards vest or are settled and are recognized in Income Tax Expense in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and in cash flows from operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs include all costs to warehouse, pick, pack, and deliver inventory to customers.

These costs, which were $

665.3

million, $

619.7

million, and $

590.8

million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, are included in Distribution, Selling, and Administrative in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Supplier Reserves

The Company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them from the Company. These reserve estimates are established based upon the judgment of Company management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs, and any other pertinent information available to the Company. The Company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based upon changes in factual circumstances. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different than the Company's estimate.

Note 2.

Acquisitions and Investments

NEVSCO

In December 2017, the Company acquired Northeast Veterinary Supply Company ("NEVSCO") for $

70.0

million. NEVSCO was an independent, regional distributor of veterinary pharmaceuticals and medical supplies serving primarily the northeast region of the United States and strengthens MWI Animal Health's ("MWI") support of independent veterinary practices and provides even greater value and care to current and future animal health customers. NEVSCO is included within the MWI operating segment.

The purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values on the date of the acquisition. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired by $

30.4

million, which was allocated to goodwill. The fair value of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable and accrued expenses acquired was $

8.5

million, $

6.7

million, and $

2.9

million, respectively. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired of $

29.8

million primarily consisted of customer relationships, which the Company is amortizing over its estimated useful life of


years. Goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the acquisition are deductible for income tax purposes.

H.D. Smith

In January 2018, the Company acquired H.D. Smith Holding Company ("H.D. Smith") for $

815.0

million. The Company funded the acquisition through the issuance of new long-term debt (see Note 7). H.D. Smith was the largest independent pharmaceutical wholesaler in the United States and provides full-line distribution of brand, generic, and specialty drugs, as well as high-value services and solutions for manufacturers and healthcare providers. H.D. Smith's customers included retail pharmacies, specialty pharmacies, long-term care facilities, institutional/hospital systems, and independent physicians and clinics. The acquisition strengthens the Company's core business, expands and enhances its strategic scale in pharmaceutical distribution, and expands the Company's support for independent community pharmacies. H.D. Smith has been integrated into the Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment.

The purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values on the date of acquisition. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired by



$

499.9

million, which was allocated to goodwill. The fair value of accounts receivable, inventory, and accounts payable and accrued expenses acquired was $

163.1

million, $

350.7

million, and $

366.1

million, respectively. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired of $

167.8

million consisted of customer relationships of $

156.6

million and a tradename of $

11.2

million. The Company is amortizing the fair value of the customer relationships and the tradename over their estimated useful lives of


years and


years, respectively. The Company established a deferred tax liability of $

60.6

million primarily in connection with the intangible assets acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the acquisition are not deductible for income tax purposes.

Profarma and Specialty Joint Venture

As of September 30, 2017, the Company held a noncontrolling ownership interest in Profarma, a leading pharmaceutical wholesaler in Brazil, and an ownership interest in a joint venture with Profarma to provide specialty distribution and services to the Brazilian marketplace (the "specialty joint venture"). The Company had accounted for these interests as equity method investments, which were reported in Other Assets on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. In January 2018, the Company invested an additional $

62.5

million in Profarma and an additional $

15.6

million in the specialty joint venture to increase its ownership interests to

38.2

% and

64.5

%, respectively. In connection with the additional investment in Profarma, the Company received substantial governance rights, thereby requiring it to begin consolidating the operating results of Profarma as of March 31, 2018 (see Note 3). The Company also began to consolidate the operating results of the specialty joint venture as of March 31, 2018 due to its majority ownership interest. In September 2018, the Company made an additional investment of $

23.6

million in the specialty joint venture to increase its ownership interest to

89.9

%. Profarma and the specialty joint venture are included within the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment and Other, respectively.

The fair value of Profarma, including the noncontrolling interest, was determined based upon an agreed-upon stock price and was allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities consolidated based upon their fair values at the time of the January 2018 investment. The fair value of Profarma upon obtaining control exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets consolidated by $

142.0

million, which was allocated to goodwill. The fair value of accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses was $

160.1

million, $

190.5

million, and $

167.7

million, respectively. The Company consolidated short-term debt and long-term debt of $

209.9

million and $

12.4

million, respectively, cash of $

150.8

million, and recorded a noncontrolling interest of $

168.0

million. The estimated fair value of the intangible assets consolidated of $

84.6

million consisted of customer relationships of $

25.9

million and a tradename of $

58.7

million. The Company is amortizing the customer relationships over its estimated useful life of


years and the tradenames over their estimated useful lives of between


years and


years. The Company established a deferred tax liability of $

50.1

million primarily in connection with the intangible assets that were recognized. Goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the consolidation are not deductible for income tax purposes.

The fair value of the specialty joint venture was determined based upon the cost of the incremental ownership percentage acquired from the January 2018 investment and was allocated to the underlying assets and liabilities consolidated based upon their fair values at the time of the January 2018 investment. The fair value of the specialty joint venture exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets consolidated by $

3.5

million, which was allocated to goodwill. The fair value of accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and accrued expenses was $

65.0

million, $

29.1

million, and $

54.3

million, respectively. The Company consolidated short-term debt and cash of $

32.7

million and $

28.9

million, respectively. The estimated fair value of the intangible assets consolidated of $

4.6

million is being amortized over its estimated useful life of


years. Goodwill and intangible assets resulting from the consolidation are not deductible for income tax purposes.

In connection with the incremental January 2018 Brazil investments, the Company adjusted the carrying values of its previously held equity interests in Profarma and the specialty joint venture to equal their fair values, which were determined to be $

103.1

million and $

31.2

million, respectively. These represent Level 2 nonrecurring fair value measurements. The adjustments resulted in a pretax loss of $

42.3

million in fiscal 2018 and were comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss of $

45.9

million, a $

12.4

million gain on the remeasurement of Profarma's previously held equity interest, and an $

8.8

million loss on the remeasurement of the specialty joint venture's previously held equity interest.



Note 3.

Variable Interest Entity

As discussed in Note 2, the Company made an additional investment in Profarma in January 2018. In connection with this investment, the Company obtained substantial governance rights, allowing it to direct the activities that significantly impact Profarma’s economic performance. As such, the Company consolidated the operating results of Profarma in its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods ended September 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019. The Company is not obligated to provide future financial support to Profarma.

The following assets and liabilities of Profarma are included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet:

Profarma's assets can only be used to settle its obligations, and its creditors do not have recourse to the general credit of the Company.

Profarma Retail Equity Offering

In August 2020, Profarma received $

66.4

million through an equity offering of its retail business. The equity offering decreased Profarma's voting ownership interest in the retail business from


% to

53.5

%. Profarma continues to consolidate the operating results of the retail business in its consolidated financial statements.

Note 5.

Income Taxes

The following table summarizes the Company's (loss) income before income taxes for the periods indicated:

The components of the Company's consolidated income tax (benefit) expense are summarized in the following table for the periods indicated:

A reconciliation of the statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to the Company's consolidated effective income tax rate is as follows for the periods indicated:

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security ("CARES") Act became law on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act was a response to the market volatility and instability resulting from the coronavirus pandemic and included provisions to support businesses in the form of loans, grants, and tax changes, among other types of relief that were not previously available under the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "2017 Tax Act"). As it relates to the Company, the CARES Act provided relief through adjustments to net operating loss rules and the acceleration of available refunds for alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards.



PharMEDium

As discussed in Note 1, the Company decided in January 2020 to shut down and permanently exit the PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings LLC ("PharMEDium") compounding business. Following the decision to exit PharMEDium and in connection with the permanent shutdown of this business, PharMEDium underwent a voluntary change in tax status, which resulted in the Company recognizing a worthless stock ordinary income tax deduction of approximately $

2.4

billion and, in turn, yielded a tax benefit of approximately $


million. The estimated tax benefit is higher than it would have been prior to the enactment of the CARES Act as the net operating losses resulting from the worthless stock deduction can now be carried back to years with higher statutory tax rates.

In addition to the PharMEDium worthless stock deduction, the Company recognized other discrete tax benefits primarily resulting from the CARES Act. In the aggregate, the Company recognized discrete tax benefits of $

720.6

million in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020.

The Company's September 30, 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheet includes a net current income tax receivable balance of $

488.4

million primarily resulting from the recognition of the above discrete tax benefits.

Swiss Tax Reform

In August 2020, the Canton of Bern enacted tax reforms to comply with requirements imposed by earlier Swiss federal tax reforms, which are retroactively effective as of January 1, 2020. A key provision of the Swiss federal tax reforms was the elimination of cantonal preferential tax regimes, which had the effect of increasing overall tax rates on Swiss income. To phase in the tax rate increase, the canton of Bern has granted a tax ruling to the Company that effectively reduces the Company's Swiss tax rate for a period of


years.

As a result of the aforementioned Swiss tax law change and ruling, the Company recorded a $

582.4

million gross deferred tax asset, which was offset in part by a $

221.7

million valuation allowance for amounts that it is more likely than not will not be realized. The net $

360.7

million deferred tax asset is expected to be realized over the next


years resulting in an increase in the Company’s consolidated effective tax rates.

Opioid Legal Accrual

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recorded a $

6.6

billion legal accrual in connection with litigation relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications. The Company is currently in advanced discussions, which are ongoing, with the states and various plaintiff's representatives that would be necessary to reach a global settlement of the Multidistrict Litigation ("MDL") and related state-court litigation brought by certain state and local governmental entities to be paid over


years assuming all parties participate (see Note 14). As a result, the Company recognized a deferred tax benefit of $

1.1

billion, which reflects an unrecognized tax benefit of $

359.5

million

U.S. Tax Reform: Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Act was signed into law. The 2017 Tax Act included a broad range of tax reform provisions affecting businesses, including lower corporate tax rates, changes in business deductions, and new international tax provisions. In response to the 2017 Tax Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued guidance regarding the accounting for income taxes associated with the 2017 Tax Act to allow companies to record provisional amounts during a one-year measurement period. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company recognized income tax benefits of $

612.6

million on the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations related to effects of the 2017 Tax Act, which consisted of a deferred income tax benefit of $

897.6

million as a result of applying a lower U.S. federal income tax rate to the Company's net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017 and a one-time transition tax on historical foreign earnings and profits. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company initially recorded a current U.S. income tax expense of $

285.0

million on historical foreign earnings and profits through December 31, 2017. The Company completed the accounting for the effects of the 2017 Tax Act in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018 and recognized an income tax benefit of $

37.0

million related to a decrease in its foreign earnings and profits through December 31, 2017 (the "transition tax"). The Company expects to pay $

182.6

million related to the transition tax, which is net of overpayments and tax credits, over a six-year period commencing in January 2021. There were

no

adjustments recorded to deferred income taxes related to the 2017 Tax Act during the one-year measurement period.

Prior to the 2017 Tax Act, the Company intended to indefinitely reinvest its foreign cash in foreign investments and foreign operations. After further assessment of the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, the Company reevaluated its position and determined that it was no longer reinvested with respect to foreign subsidiaries whose undistributed earnings are able to be repatriated with minimal to no additional tax impact. Cumulative undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries were $




billion as of September 30, 2020, $

2.3

billion of which is considered permanently reinvested. It is not practicable to estimate the taxes that would be due if such earnings were to be repatriated in the future.

Deferred income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts.

Significant components of the Company's deferred tax liabilities (assets) are as follows:

The following tax net operating loss and credit carryforward information is presented as of September 30, 2020. The Company had $

12.4

million of potential tax benefits from federal net operating loss carryforwards, which expire in


to


years, $

201.2

million of potential tax benefits from state net operating loss carryforwards and $

58.9

million of potential tax benefits from foreign net operating loss carryforwards, which have varying expiration dates. The Company had $

12.8

million of tax credit carryforwards and $

2.1

million in foreign alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards.

The Company assesses the available positive and negative evidence to determine whether deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized. As a result of this assessment, valuation allowances have been recorded on certain deferred tax assets. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company increased the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $

212.0

million and $

0.3

million, respectively. The increase in the valuation allowance in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 was primarily due to the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax asset established in connection with Swiss Tax Reform (see above).

In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 tax benefits of $

3.9

million, $

7.9

million and $

22.7

million, respectively, related to the exercise of employee stock options and lapses of restricted stock units were recorded in Income Tax (Benefit) Expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. The tax benefits recognized in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 are not necessarily indicative of amounts that may arise in future periods.

Income tax payments, net of refunds, were $

139.4

million, $

117.7

million, and $

104.0

million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various states and foreign jurisdictions. The Company is currently undergoing a U.S. federal income tax audit for fiscal year 2018 and certain state and local income tax audits for various years. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016. The Company believes it has adequate tax reserves to cover potential federal, state or foreign tax exposures.

As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, defined as the aggregate tax effect of differences between tax return positions and the benefits recognized in the Company's financial statements, of $

498.3

million and $

124.2

million, respectively ($

455.5

million and $

95.0

million, net of federal tax benefit, respectively). If



recognized in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, $

437.2

million and $

76.8

million, respectively, of these benefits would have reduced income tax expense and the effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2020 and 2019, included in the unrecognized tax benefits are $

19.9

million and $

18.6

million of interest and penalties, respectively, which the Company records in Income Tax (Benefit) Expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the periods indicated is as follows:

In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, the Company recorded a reserve associated with civil litigation that was considered to be non-deductible. In September 2018, the Company made a payment of $

625.0

million, plus interest, to resolve this litigation, and it was determined that a portion of the settlement was deductible. Accordingly, the Company reduced its unrecognized tax benefit by $

10.3

million and $

224.9

million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Included in the additions of unrecognized tax benefits in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 is $

371.5

million for an unrecognized tax benefit related to the $

6.6

billion legal accrual for litigation related to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications, as disclosed in Note 14. As of September 30, 2020, a settlement has not been reached, and, therefore, the Company applied significant judgment in estimating the ultimate amount of the opioid litigation settlement that would be deductible for U.S. federal and state purposes. In estimating the amount that would ultimately be deductible, the Company considered prior U.S. tax case law, the amount and character of the damages sought in the opioid litigation, the inherent uncertainty related to litigation of this nature and magnitude, and other relevant factors. While the Company believes that its estimate of the uncertain tax benefit appropriately reflects these considerations, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefit recorded as of September 30, 2020 may be revised in future periods as the settlement with the various plaintiffs is finalized. During the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that state tax audit resolutions and the expiration of statutes of limitations could result in a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately $

13.9

million.

Note 6.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The following is a summary of the changes in the carrying value of goodwill, by reportable segment, for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020 and 2019:



The following is a summary of other intangible assets:

Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $

110.9

million, $

167.4

million, and $

181.2

million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets is estimated to be $

101.9

million in fiscal 2021, $

100.3

million in fiscal 2022, $

98.8

million in fiscal 2023, $

97.4

million in fiscal 2024, $

96.6

million in 2025, and $

705.8

million thereafter.

Note 7.

Debt

Debt consisted of the following:

Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility

The Company has a $

1.4

billion multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility ("Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility"), is scheduled to expire in September 2024, with a syndicate of lenders. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based upon the Company's debt rating and ranges from


basis points to

112.5

basis points over CDOR/LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as applicable (


basis points over CDOR/LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee as of September 30, 2020) and from


basis points to

12.5

basis points over the alternate base rate and Canadian prime rate, as applicable. The Company pays facility fees to maintain the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on its debt rating, ranging from


basis points to

12.5

basis points, annually, of the total commitment (


basis points as of September 30, 2020). The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of subsidiaries and asset sales, with which the Company was compliant as of September 30, 2020. The opioid litigation accrual discussed in Note 14 has not and is not expected to have an impact on the Company's compliance with its debt covenants.



Commercial Paper Program

The Company has a commercial paper program whereby it may from time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $

1.4

billion at any one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance. The notes will bear interest, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount from their face amounts. The commercial paper program does not increase the Company's borrowing capacity as it is fully backed by the Company's Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility. There were

no

borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program as of September 30, 2020 and 2019.

Receivables Securitization Facility

The Company has a $

1,450

million receivables securitization facility ("Receivables Securitization Facility"), which is scheduled to expire in September 2022. The Company has available to it an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $


million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or LIBOR, plus a program fee. The Company pays a customary unused fee at prevailing market rates, annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility.

In connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation and a specialty distribution subsidiary sell on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a wholly-owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the receivables to financial institutions and commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. As sold receivables are collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. The facility is a financing vehicle utilized by the Company because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. The Company securitizes its trade accounts, which are generally non-interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as borrowings. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, with which the Company was compliant as of September 30, 2020.

Revolving Credit Note and Overdraft Facility

The Company has an uncommitted, unsecured line of credit available to it pursuant to a revolving credit note ("Revolving Credit Note"). The Revolving Credit Note provides the Company with the ability to request short-term unsecured revolving credit loans from time to time in a principal amount not to exceed $


million. The Revolving Credit Note may be decreased or terminated by the bank or the Company at any time without prior notice. The Company also has a £


million uncommitted U.K. overdraft facility ("Overdraft Facility"), which expires in February 2021, to fund short-term normal trading cycle fluctuations related to its MWI business.

Term Loans

In October 2018, the Company refinanced $


million of outstanding Term Loans by issuing a new $


million variable-rate term loan ("October 2018 Term Loan"), which matured and was repaid in October 2020.

Senior Notes

In May 2020, the Company issued $


million of

2.80

% senior notes due May 15, 2030 (the "2030 Notes"). The 2030 Notes were sold at

99.71

% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of

2.81

%. Interest on the 2030 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears, commencing on November 15, 2020. The 2030 Notes rank pari passu to the Company's other senior notes, the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Note, the and Overdraft Facility.

The Company used the proceeds from the 2030 Notes to finance the early retirement of the $


million of

3.50

% senior notes that were due in 2021 and made a $

21.4

million prepayment premium in connection with this early retirement.

In December 2017, the Company issued $


million of

3.45

% senior notes due December 15, 2027 (the "2027 Notes") and $


million of

4.30

% senior notes due December 15, 2047 (the "2047 Notes"). The 2027 Notes were sold at

99.76

% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of

3.48

%. The 2047 Notes were sold at

99.51

% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of

4.33

%. Interest on the 2027 Notes and the 2047 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears and commenced on June 15, 2018. The 2027 and 2047 Notes rank pari passu to the Company's other senior notes, the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility, the Revolving Credit Note, the Overdraft Facility, and the October 2018 Term Loan.



The Company used the proceeds from the 2027 Notes and the 2047 Notes to finance the early retirement of the $


million of

4.875

% senior notes that were due in 2019, including the payment of a $

22.3

million prepayment premium, and to finance the acquisition of H.D. Smith, which was completed in January 2018 (see Note 2).

The senior notes are collectively referred to as the "Notes." Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears. The Notes were sold at small discounts to the principal amounts and, therefore, have effective yields that are greater than the stated interest rates in the table above. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the Notes were deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the Notes. The indentures governing the Notes contain restrictions and covenants, which include limitations on additional indebtedness; distributions to stockholders; the repurchase of stock and the making of other restricted payments; issuance of preferred stock; creation of certain liens; transactions with subsidiaries and other affiliates; and certain corporate acts such as mergers, consolidations, and the sale of substantially all assets. An additional covenant requires compliance with a financial leverage ratio test. The Company was compliant with all covenants as of September 30, 2020.

Nonrecourse Debt

Nonrecourse debt is comprised of short-term and long-term debt belonging to the Brazil subsidiaries and is repaid solely from the Brazil subsidiaries' cash flows and such debt agreements provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts, and cash flows of the Brazil subsidiaries.

Note 10.

Retirement and Other Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans and a deferred compensation plan covering eligible employees.

The Compensation and Succession Planning Committee ("Compensation Committee") of the Company's board of directors has delegated the administration of the Company's retirement and other benefit plans to its Benefits Committee, an internal committee, comprised of senior finance, human resources, and legal executives. The Benefits Committee is responsible for the investment options under the Company's savings plans, as well as performance of the investment advisers and plan administrators.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company sponsors the AmerisourceBergen Employee Investment Plan (the "Plan"), which is a defined contribution 401(k) plan covering salaried and certain hourly employees. Eligible participants may contribute to the plan from


% to


% of their regular compensation before taxes. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company contributed $

1.00

for each $1.00 invested by the participant up to the first


% of the participant's salary. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company contributes $

1.00

for each $1.00 invested by the participant up to the first


% of the participant's salary and $

0.50

for each additional $1.00 invested by the participant of up to an additional


% of salary. An additional discretionary contribution, in an amount not to exceed the limits established by the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC"), may also be made depending upon the Company's performance. Based on the Company's performance in fiscal 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recognized an expense for discretionary contributions to the Plan in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018. All contributions are invested at the direction of the employee in one or more funds. All contributions vest immediately except for the discretionary contributions made by the Company, which vest in full after

five years

of credited service.

The Company also sponsors the AmerisourceBergen Corporation Benefit Restoration Plan. This unfunded plan provides benefits to selected key management, including all of the Company's executive officers. Effective January 1, 2017, this plan provided eligible participants with an annual amount equal to


% of the participant's total cash compensation to the extent that his or her compensation exceeds the annual compensation limit established by Section 401(a) (17) of the IRC. Effective January 1, 2019, this plan provides eligible participants with an annual amount equal to


% of the participant's total cash compensation to the extent that his or her compensation exceeds the annual compensation limit established by Section 401(a) (17) of the IRC.

Costs of the defined contribution plans charged to expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $

45.9

million, $

51.0

million, and $

37.9

million, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plan

The Company sponsors the AmerisourceBergen Corporation 2001 Deferred Compensation Plan. This unfunded plan, under which

2.96

million shares of common stock are authorized for issuance, allows eligible officers, directors, and key management employees to defer a portion of their annual compensation. The amount deferred may be allocated by the employee to cash, mutual funds, or stock credits. Stock credits, including dividend equivalents, are equal to the full and fractional number of shares of common stock that could be purchased with the participant's compensation allocated to stock credits based upon the average of closing prices of common stock during each month, plus, at the discretion of the board of directors, up to one-half of a share of common stock for each full share credited. Stock credit distributions are made in shares of common stock.

No

shares of common stock have been issued under the deferred compensation plan through September 30, 2020. The Company's liability relating to its deferred compensation plan as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 was $

31.1

million and $

28.0

million, respectively.

Note 11.

Share-Based Compensation

Stock Options

The Company's employee stock option plans provide for the granting of incentive and nonqualified stock options to acquire shares of common stock to employees at a price not less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date the option is granted. Option terms and vesting periods are determined at the date of grant by the Compensation Committee of the board of directors. Employee options generally vest ratably, in equal amounts, over a

four

-year service period and expire in

seven years

. The Company's non-employee director stock option plans provide for the granting of nonqualified stock options to acquire shares of common stock to non-employee directors at the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. Non-employee director options vest ratably, in equal amounts, over a

three

-year service period and expire in

ten years

. Non-employee director options have not been granted since February 2011.



As of September 30, 2020, employee and non-employee director stock options and restricted stock units for an additional

9.2

million shares may be granted under the AmerisourceBergen Corporation Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Plan").

The estimated fair value of options granted is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards and are net of estimated forfeitures. The Company estimates the fair values of option grants using a binomial option pricing model. Expected volatilities are based upon the historical volatility of the Company's common stock and other factors, such as implied market volatility. The Company uses historical exercise data, taking into consideration the optionees' ages at grant date, to estimate the terms for which the options are expected to be outstanding. The Company anticipates that it not will grant any stock options in fiscal 2021. The risk-free rates during the terms of such options are based upon the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The weighted average fair values of the options granted during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $

16.61

, $

18.60

, and $

14.16

, respectively.

The following weighted average assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of options granted:

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recognized stock option expense of $

13.0

million, $

21.0

million, and $

22.6

million, respectively.

A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for its option plans for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 is presented below:

The intrinsic value of stock option exercises during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $

42.6

million, $

51.2

million, and $

116.7

million, respectively.

A summary of the status of the Company's nonvested options as of September 30, 2020 and changes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 is presented below:

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the total fair values of options vested were $

21.3

million, $

22.7

million, and $

25.8

million, respectively. Expected future compensation expense relating to the

2.1

million nonvested options outstanding as of September 30, 2020 is $

10.3

million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.7

years.



Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units vest in full after three years. The estimated fair value of restricted stock units under the Company's restricted stock unit plans is determined by the product of the number of shares granted and the grant date market price of the Company's common stock. The estimated fair value of restricted stock units is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recognized restricted stock unit expense of $

39.8

million, $

29.2

million, and $

26.8

million, respectively.

A summary of the status of the Company's nonvested restricted stock units as of September 30, 2020 and changes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 are presented below:

During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the total fair values of restricted stock units vested were $

26.4

million, $

14.5

million, and $

15.8

million, respectively. Expected future compensation expense relating to the

1.5

million restricted stock units outstanding as of September 30, 2020 is $

43.4

million, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of

1.4

years.

Performance Stock Units

Performance stock units are granted to certain executive employees under the Plan and represent common stock potentially issuable in the future. Performance stock units vest at the end of a

three

-year performance period based upon achievement of specific performance goals. Based upon the extent to which the targets are achieved, vested shares for awards granted prior to fiscal 2018 may range from


% to


% of the target award amount. For awards granted beginning in fiscal 2018, vested shares may range from


% to


% of the target award amount. The fair value of performance stock units is determined by the grant date market price of the Company's common stock. Compensation expense associated with nonvested performance stock units is recognized over the requisite service period and is dependent on the Company's periodic assessment of the probability of the targets being achieved and its estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately be issued. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recognized performance stock expense of $

21.5

million, $

8.5

million, and $

12.8

million, respectively.

A summary of the status of the Company's nonvested performance stock units as of September 30, 2020 and changes during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 is presented below (based upon target award amounts).

Shares that vested over the

three

-year performance period ended September 30, 2020 were distributed to employees in November 2020.

Employee Severance, Litigation, and Other

The following illustrates the charges incurred by the Company relating to Employee Severance, Litigation, and Other for the periods indicated:

Employee severance in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 included costs primarily related to position eliminations resulting from the Company's decision to permanently exit the PharMEDium compounding business. Employee severance in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 included costs primarily related to PharMEDium restructuring activities, position eliminations resulting from our business transformation efforts and the integration of H.D. Smith, and restructuring activities related to our consulting business. Employee severance in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 included costs primarily related to position eliminations resulting from the Company's business transformation efforts and restructuring activities related to our consulting business.



Litigation and opioid-related costs in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 included costs primarily related to a $

6.6

billion legal accrual ($

5.5

billion, net of an income tax benefit) (see Note 14) and legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations. Litigation and opioid-related costs in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 consisted of $

116.7

million of legal settlements and accruals and $

68.5

million of legal fees in connection with opioid lawsuits and investigations. Litigation and opioid-related costs in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 primarily related to opioid lawsuits, investigations, and related initiatives.

Acquisition-related deal and integration costs in the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2019

are primarily related to the integration of H.D. Smith. Integration costs primarily included costs to transition servicing legacy H.D. Smith customers to existing company distribution facilities and operating systems. Acquisition-related deal and integration costs in the fiscal year ended

September 30, 2018

were primarily related to the acquisition of H.D. Smith.

Business transformation efforts in the fiscal years ended

September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018

were primarily related to costs associated with reorganizing the Company to further align the organization to its customers' needs. The majority of these costs were related to services provided by third-party consultants, including certain technology initiatives.

Other restructuring initiatives in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 included a $

19.1

million gain on the sale of property.

Note 14.

Legal Matters and Contingencies

In the ordinary course of its business, the Company becomes involved in lawsuits, administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, government investigations, stockholder demands, and other disputes, including antitrust, commercial, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory, employment discrimination, and other matters. Significant damages or penalties may be sought from the Company in some matters, and some matters may require years for the Company to resolve. The Company records a reserve for these matters when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.

For those matters for which the Company has not recognized a liability, the Company cannot predict the outcome of their impact on the Company as uncertainty remains with regard to whether such matters will proceed to trial, whether settlements will be reached, and the amount and terms of any such settlements. Outcomes may include settlements in significant amounts that are not currently estimable, limitations on the Company's conduct, the imposition of corporate integrity agreement obligations, consent decrees, and/or other civil and criminal penalties. From time to time, the Company is also involved in disputes with its customers, which the Company generally seeks to resolve through commercial negotiations. If negotiations are unsuccessful, the parties may litigate the dispute or otherwise attempt to settle the matter.

With respect to the specific legal proceedings and claims described below, unless otherwise noted, the amount or range of possible losses is not reasonably estimable. There can be no assurance that the settlement, resolution, or other outcome of one or more matters, including the matters set forth below, during any subsequent reporting period will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or cash flows for that period or on the Company's financial condition.

Opioid Lawsuits and Investigations

A significant number of counties, municipalities, and other governmental entities in a majority of U.S. states and Puerto Rico, as well as numerous states and tribes, have filed lawsuits in various federal, state and other courts against pharmaceutical wholesale distributors (including the Company and certain subsidiaries, such as AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation ("ABDC") and H.D. Smith), pharmaceutical manufacturers, retail chains, medical practices, and physicians relating to the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications. Other lawsuits regarding the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications have been filed by: third-party payors and similar entities; hospitals; hospital groups; and individuals, including cases styled as putative class actions. The lawsuits, which have been and continue to be filed in federal, state, and other courts, generally allege violations of controlled substance laws and various other statutes as well as common law claims, including negligence, public nuisance, and unjust enrichment, and seek equitable relief and monetary damages. An initial group of cases was consolidated for Multidistrict Litigation ("MDL") proceedings before the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (the "Court") in December 2017. Additional cases have been, and will likely continue to be, transferred to the MDL. Further, in June 2018, the Court granted a motion permitting the United States, through the DOJ, to participate in settlement discussions and as a friend of the Court by providing information to facilitate non-monetary remedies.

In April 2018, the Court issued an order creating a litigation track, which includes dispositive motion practice, discovery, and trials in certain bellwether jurisdictions. In December 2018, the Court issued an order selecting two additional cases for a second bellwether discovery and trial track.

In November 2019 and January 2020, the Court filed Suggestions of



Remand with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation that identified four cases filed against the Company, including the two additional bellwether cases, for potential transfer from the MDL back to federal courts in California, Oklahoma, and West Virginia for the completion of discovery, motion practice, and trial.

All four cases have now been remanded to those federal district courts and discovery has commenced. The two consolidated cases in West Virginia that were scheduled to commence trial on October 19, 2020 were postponed to January 4, 2021 due to COVID-19. For the California case, the current trial date is October 25, 2021. No trial date has been established for the Oklahoma case, in which the plaintiff is the Cherokee Nation

.

On October 21, 2019, the Company announced an agreement in principle with two Ohio counties, Cuyahoga and Summit, to settle all claims brought by the two counties against the Company in the first track of the MDL. Pursuant to the settlement, claims against the Company were dismissed with prejudice and the Company made a payment of $

66.7

million in December 2019. The Company had previously recorded a charge of $

66.7

million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019 within Employee Severance, Litigation and Other in its Statement of Operations and in Accrued Expenses and Other on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.

On October 21, 2019, the Attorneys General for North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Texas announced certain proposed settlement terms intended to provide a potential framework for a global resolution of the state and local government entity lawsuits in the MDL and in state courts, including cases currently filed and that could be filed. The attorneys general's announcement outlined that the three largest U.S. pharmaceutical distributors would be expected to pay an aggregate amount of up to $

18.0

billion over


years, of which the Company's portion would be


%, in addition to the development and participation in a program for free or rebated distribution of opioid-abuse medications for a period of


years and the implementation of industry-wide changes to be specified to controlled substance anti-diversion programs. Since that time, the Company has engaged in discussions that include the four attorneys general, as well as other attorneys general, plaintiffs' lawyers representing local governments, and other parties with the objective of reaching potential terms for a global resolution.

The Company is currently in advanced discussions, which are ongoing, with the states and various plaintiffs’ representatives that would be necessary to reach a global settlement of the MDL and related state-court litigation brought by certain state and local governmental entities by the

three

largest U.S. pharmaceutical distributors of $

21.0

billion to be paid over


years in which th

e Company’s payment would be $

6.5

billion assuming all parties participate. A portion of this amount relating to plaintiff attorney fees would be payable over a shorter time period. The discussions also involve certain changes to the Company's anti-diversion programs.

While a global settlement remains subject to contingencies that could impact whether the parties ultimately decide to move forward, the Company believes a global settlement is probable and its loss related thereto can be reasonably estimated as of September 30, 2020. The Company has recorded a charge of

$

6.6

billion

in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 within Employee Severance, Litigation and Other in its Statement of Operations related to the global settlement as well as other opioid-related litigation. The Company currently estimates that $

408.0

million will be paid prior to September 30, 2021, which is recorded in Accrued Expenses and Other on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The remaining liability of $

6.2

billion is recorded in Accrued Litigation Liability on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. While the Company has accrued its estimated liability for this matter, it is unable to estimate the range of possible loss associated with these opioid litigation matters. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The Company will regularly review these opioid litigation matters to determine whether its accrual is adequate. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from the

$

6.6

billion accrual

. Until such time as a plaintiff participates in a global settlement or otherwise resolves its lawsuit, the Company will continue

to litigate and prepare for trial in the cases pending in the MDL, those remanded from the MDL to federal district courts, as well as in state courts where lawsuits have been filed, and intends to continue to vigorously defend itself in all such cases. Since these matters are still developing, the Company is unable to predict the outcome, but the result of these lawsuits could include excessive monetary verdicts and/or injunctive relief that may affect the Company's operations. Further, any final settlement among parties may differ materially from the Company's advanced discussions related to global resolution of the MDL and related state-court litigation involving certain state and local governmental entities.

In June 2019, attorneys for some of the plaintiffs filed a motion proposing a procedure to certify a nationwide "negotiation class" of cities and counties for the purpose of negotiating and settling with defendants engaged in the nationwide manufacturing, sale, or distribution of opioids. The attorneys subsequently withdrew the motion and refiled an amended motion on July 9, 2019. The Court granted the motion on September 11, 2019 and certain defendants, including ABDC filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On September 24, 2020, the Sixth Circuit reversed the Court's prior order. On October 8, 2020, certain of the plaintiffs filed a petition asking the Sixth Circuit to rehear the matter

en banc

, which has not yet been decided.

Notwithstanding the Company's accrual of $

6.6

billion, a trial in New York state for cases brought by Nassau and Suffolk Counties and the New York Attorney General against a variety of defendants, including the Company, was scheduled to



begin on March 20, 2020.

The trial is not part of the MDL and has been delayed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. The court has not yet set a new trial date but has expressed an intention to commence trial early in 2021, if possible. A trial in Ohio state court for a case brought by the Ohio Attorney General against ABDC and certain other pharmaceutical wholesale distributors was scheduled to begin trial on October 19, 2020 but has been postponed to March 8, 2021. Several other cases filed in various state courts have trial dates scheduled in 2021 and later, although all such dates are subject to change

.

Aside from those parties that have already filed suit, other entities, including additional attorneys general’s offices, counties, and cities in multiple states, may continue to file additional lawsuits or enforcement proceedings. The Company is vigorously defending itself in the pending lawsuits and intends to vigorously defend itself against any threatened lawsuits or enforcement proceedings.

The Company has also received subpoenas, civil investigative demands, and other requests for information, requesting the production of documents regarding the distribution of prescription opioid pain medications from government agencies in other jurisdictions, including certain states. The Company is engaged in discussions with representatives from these government agencies regarding the requests and has been producing responsive documents. The Company cannot predict how these matters would be affected by a global settlement.

Since July 2017, the Company has received subpoenas from several U.S. Attorney's Offices, including grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of New Jersey ("USAO-NJ") and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York ("USAO-EDNY"). Those subpoenas request the production of a broad range of documents pertaining to the Company's distribution of controlled substances through its various subsidiaries, including ABDC, and its diversion control programs. The Company has been engaged in discussions with the various U.S. Attorney’s Offices, including the Health Care and Government Fraud Unit of the Criminal Division of the USAO-NJ, and has been producing documents in response to the subpoenas.

Government Enforcement and Related Litigation Matters

On May 17, 2019, PharMEDium reached an agreement on the terms of the Consent Decree with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") and the DOJ that was entered by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on May 22, 2019.

As previously disclosed, in late January 2020 the Company decided to permanently exit the PharMEDium compounding business. As a result the Company ceased all commercial operations related to this business as well as all administrative operations other than those needed to complete the shutdown.

While PharMEDium has ceased commercial operations, it remains subject to the terms of the Consent Decree and continues to work with the FDA and the DOJ to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

Subpoenas, Ongoing Investigations, and Other Contingencies

From time to time, the Company receives subpoenas or requests for information from various government agencies relating to the Company's business or to the business of a customer, supplier, or other industry participant. The Company's responses often require time and effort and can result in considerable costs being incurred. Most of these matters are resolved without incident; however, such subpoenas or requests can lead to the assertion of claims or the commencement of civil or criminal legal proceedings against the Company and other members of the healthcare industry, as well as to substantial settlements.

In January 2017, the Company's subsidiary U.S. Bioservices Corporation ("U.S. Bio") received a subpoena for information from the USAO-EDNY relating to its activities in connection with billing for products and making returns of potential overpayments to government payers. A

filed qui tam complaint related to the investigation was unsealed in April 2019 and the relator filed an amended complaint under seal in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York. In December 2019, the government filed a notice that it was declining to intervene. The court ordered that the relator's complaint against the Company, including subsidiaries AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, LLC and U.S. Bio, be unsealed.

The relator’s complaint alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act and the false claims acts of various states. The relator filed a second amended complaint, removing one state false claims act count. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint and all briefing on the motion was filed with the court on October 9, 2020

.



On October 11, 2019, Teamsters Local 443 Health Services & Insurance Plan, St. Paul Electrical Construction Pension Plan, St. Paul Electrical Construction Workers Supplemental Pension Plan (2014 Restatement), Retirement Medical Funding Plan for the St. Paul Electrical Workers, and San Antonio Fire & Police Pension Fund filed a complaint for a purported derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors (collectively, "Defendants"). The complaint alleges that the Defendants breached their fiduciary duties by failing to oversee the compliance by certain of the Company's subsidiaries (including the Company's former subsidiary Medical Initiatives, Inc. ("MII")) with federal regulations, allegedly resulting in the payment of fines and penalties in connection with the settlements with the USAO-EDNY in fiscal 2017 and 2018 that resolved claims arising from MII's pre-filled syringe program. In December 2019, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. After briefing and oral argument, on August 24, 2020 the Delaware Court of Chancery denied Defendants' motion to dismiss. On September 24, 2020, the Board of Directors of the Company established a Special Litigation Committee to conduct an investigation concerning the plaintiffs’ allegations. On October 28, 2020, the Special Litigation Committee filed a motion to stay the litigation pending completion of its investigation. On November 10, 2020, the Delaware Court of Chancery granted the Special Litigation Committee’s motion to stay the litigation.

On July 17, 2020, CCAR Investments, Inc. filed a complaint for a purported derivative action in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors (“CCAR Defendants”). The complaint alleges claims for breach of fiduciary duty, corporate waste

and unjust enrichment allegedly arising from the Company’s controlled substance diversion control programs and violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

. On July 30, 2020, a group of interested stockholders (the “Proposed Intervenors”) filed a motion to intervene and stay the proceedings filed by CCAR Investments, Inc. The CCAR Defendants opposed the motion to intervene and stay on August 13, 2020. CCAR Investments, Inc. also filed an opposition to the motion to intervene and stay.  On August 14, 2020, the CCAR Defendants answered the complaint and filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On October 13, 2020, the United States District Court for the District of Delaware heard oral arguments on the Proposed Intervenors' motion to intervene and stay the litigation and denied Proposed Intervenors' motion without prejudice.

On October 29, 2020 the parties filed a stipulation permitting CCAR Investments, Inc. to file an amended complaint on or before November 20, 2020, and CCAR Defendants shall respond to the amended complaint on or before December 18, 2020.

New York State ("NYS") enacted the Opioid Stewardship Act ("OSA"), which went into effect on July 1, 2018. The OSA established an annual $


million Opioid Stewardship Fund (the "Fund") and requires manufacturers, distributors, and importers licensed in NYS to ratably source the Fund. The ratable share of the assessment for each licensee was to be based upon opioids sold or distributed to or within NYS. In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, the Company accrued $

22.0

million as an estimate of its liability under the OSA for opioids distributed from January 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018 and recognized this reserve in Cost of Goods Sold on its Consolidated Statement of Operations and in Accrued Expenses and Other on its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2018. In December 2018, the OSA was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, and, as a result, the Company reversed the $

22.0

million accrual in the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2018. In September 2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court's decision, and, as a result, the Company accrued $

14.8

million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 as it revised its estimated liability for the 2017 and 2018 calendar years. The Company has been in compliance with subsequent legislation passed by NYS regarding sales of prescription opioids for calendar years beginning in 2019.

In December 2019, Reliable Pharmacy, together with other retail pharmacies and North Sunflower Medical Center, filed a civil antitrust complaint against multiple generic drug manufacturers, and also included claims against the Company, H.D. Smith, and other drug distributors and industry participants. The case is filed as a putative class action and plaintiffs purport to represent a class of drug purchasers including other retail pharmacies and healthcare providers. The case has been consolidated for multidistrict litigation proceedings before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The complaint alleges that the Company and others in the industry participated in a conspiracy to fix prices, allocate markets and rig bids regarding generic drugs. In March 2020, the plaintiffs filed a further amended complaint. On July 15, 2020, the Company and other industry participants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.

Note 15.

Litigation Settlements

Antitrust Settlements

Numerous lawsuits have been filed against certain brand pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging that the manufacturer, by itself or in concert with others, took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drugs from entering the market. These lawsuits are generally brought as class actions. The Company has not been a named a plaintiff in any of these lawsuits, but has been a member of the direct purchasers' class (i.e., those purchasers who purchase directly from these pharmaceutical manufacturers). None of the lawsuits has gone to trial, but some have settled in the past with the Company receiving proceeds



from the settlement funds. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the Company recognized gains of $

9.1

million, $

145.9

million, and $

35.9

million, respectively, relating to these lawsuits. These gains, which are net of attorney fees and estimated payments due to other parties, were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Note 16.

Business Segment Information

The Company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers. The Company's operations are comprised of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment and other operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and, therefore, have been included in Other for the purpose of reportable segment presentation. Other consists of operating segments that focus on global commercialization services and animal health (MWI Animal Health). The operating segments that focus on global commercialization services include AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services ("ABCS") and World Courier.

The chief operating decision maker ("CODM") of the Company is the Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer of the Company, whose function is to allocate resources to, and assess the performance of, the Company's operating segments. The CODM does not review assets by operating segment for the purpose of assessing performance or allocating resources.

The Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name, specialty brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. Through a number of operating businesses, the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment provides pharmaceutical distribution (including plasma and other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and other specialty pharmaceutical products) and additional services to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including hospitals and dialysis clinics. Additionally, the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment provides data analytics, outcomes research, and additional services for biotechnology and pharmaceutical manufacturers. The Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment also provides pharmacy management, staffing and additional consulting services, and supply management software to a variety of retail and institutional healthcare providers. Additionally, it delivers packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers.

MWI is a leading animal health distribution company in the United States and in the United Kingdom. MWI sells pharmaceuticals, vaccines, parasiticides, diagnostics, micro feed ingredients, and various other products to customers in both the companion animal and production animal markets. Additionally, MWI offers demand-creating sales force services to manufacturers. ABCS, through a number of operating businesses, provides a full suite of integrated manufacturer services that range from clinical trial support to product post-approval and commercialization support. World Courier, which operates in over


countries, is a leading global specialty transportation and logistics provider for the biopharmaceutical industry.

The following illustrates reportable and operating segment disaggregated revenue as required by ASC 606 for the periods indicated:

Segment measures were adjusted in fiscal 2020 to exclude PharMEDium shutdown costs and contingent consideration adjustment as the CODM excludes these costs in the measurement of segment performance. All corporate office expenses are allocated to the operating segment level.

The Company incurred remediation costs in connection with the suspended production activities at PharMEDium (see Note 1). These remediation costs are primarily classified in Cost of Goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company incurred costs in connection with exiting the PharMEDium compounding business. These shutdown costs are primarily classified in Distribution, Selling, and Administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. These controls and procedures also are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.

The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of other members of the Company's management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a — 15(e) and 15d — 15(e) under the Exchange Act) and have concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective for their intended purposes as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2020 in the Company's internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, those controls.

MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of AmerisourceBergen Corporation ("AmerisourceBergen" or the "Company") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. AmerisourceBergen's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

AmerisourceBergen's management assessed the effectiveness of AmerisourceBergen's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on management's assessment and those criteria, management has concluded that AmerisourceBergen's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 30, 2020.

AmerisourceBergen's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of AmerisourceBergen's internal control over financial reporting. This report is set forth below.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AmerisourceBergen Corporation

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

We have audited AmerisourceBergen Corporation and subsidiaries' internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2020 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated November 19, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
