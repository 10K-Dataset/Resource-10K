PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

As used herein, the terms “Company,” “AmerisourceBergen,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to
AmerisourceBergen Corporation, a Delaware corporation.

AmerisourceBergen Corporation is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical services companies,
with operations primarily in the United States and Canada. Servicing both healthcare providers and
pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply channel, we provide drug distribution and
related services designed to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. More specifically, we
distribute a comprehensive offering of brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter
healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services to a wide variety
of healthcare providers primarily located in the United States and Canada, including acute care
hospitals and health systems, independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies,
medical and dialysis clinics, physicians and physician group practices, long-term care and other
alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. We also provide pharmacy services to certain
specialty drug patients. Additionally, we furnish healthcare providers and pharmaceutical
manufacturers with an assortment of related services, including pharmaceutical packaging, pharmacy
automation, inventory management, reimbursement and pharmaceutical consulting services, logistics
services, and pharmacy management.

Industry Overview

Pharmaceutical sales in the United States, as recently estimated by IMS Healthcare, Inc.
(“IMS”), an independent third party provider of information to the pharmaceutical and healthcare
industry, are expected to grow annually between 0% and 3% through 2015. IMS expects that certain
sectors of the market, such as biotechnology and other specialty and generic pharmaceuticals, will
grow faster than the overall market.

In addition to general economic conditions, factors that impact the growth of the
pharmaceutical industry in the United States, and other industry trends, include:

Aging Population.

The number of individuals age 55 and over in the United States currently
exceeds 75 million and is one of the most rapidly growing segments of the population. This age
group suffers from more chronic illnesses and disabilities than the rest of the population and is
estimated to account for approximately 75% of total healthcare expenditures in the United States.

Introduction of New Pharmaceuticals.

Traditional research and development, as well as the
advent of new research, production and delivery methods such as biotechnology and gene therapy,
continue to generate new pharmaceuticals and delivery methods that are more effective in treating
diseases. We believe ongoing research and development expenditures by the leading pharmaceutical
manufacturers will contribute to continued growth of the industry. In particular, we believe
ongoing research and development of biotechnology and other specialty pharmaceutical drugs will
provide opportunities for the continued growth of our specialty pharmaceuticals business.

Increased Use of Generic Pharmaceuticals.

A significant number of patents for widely used
brand-name pharmaceutical products will expire during the next several years. We expect over 30
brand to generic conversions during the next twelve months. In addition, increased emphasis by
managed care and other third party payors on utilization of generics has accelerated their growth.
We consider the increase in generic usage a favorable trend because generic pharmaceuticals have
historically provided us with a greater gross profit margin opportunity than brand-name products,
although their lower prices reduce revenue growth.

Increased Use of Drug Therapies.

In response to rising healthcare costs, governmental and
private payors have adopted cost containment measures that encourage the use of efficient drug
therapies to prevent or treat diseases. While national attention has been focused on the overall
increase in aggregate healthcare costs, we believe drug therapy has had a beneficial impact on
healthcare costs by reducing expensive surgeries and prolonged hospital stays. Pharmaceuticals
currently account for approximately 10% of overall healthcare costs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers’
continued emphasis on research and development is expected to result in the continuing introduction
of cost-effective drug therapies and new uses for existing drug therapies.

Legislative Developments.

In recent years, regulation of the healthcare industry has changed
significantly in an effort to increase drug utilization and reduce costs. These changes included
expansion of Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs, the enrollment (beginning in
2006) of Medicare beneficiaries in prescription drug plans offered by private entities, and cuts in
Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates. More recently, in
March 2010, the federal government enacted
major health reform legislation designed to expand access to health insurance, which would increase
the number of people in the United States who are eligible to be reimbursed for all or a portion of
prescription drug costs. The health reform law provides for sweeping changes to Medicare and
Medicaid policies (including drug reimbursement policies), expanded disclosure requirements
regarding financial arrangements within the healthcare industry, enhanced enforcement authority to
prevent fraud and abuse, and new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers. These policies and other legislative developments may affect
our businesses directly and/or indirectly (see Government Regulation on page 6 for further
details).



The Company

We currently serve our customers (healthcare providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers, and
certain specialty drug patients) through a geographically diverse network of distribution service
centers and other operations in the United States and Canada, and through packaging facilities in
the United States and the United Kingdom. In our pharmaceutical distribution business, we are
typically the primary source of supply of pharmaceutical and related products to our healthcare
provider customers. We offer a broad range of services to our customers designed to enhance the
efficiency and effectiveness of their operations, which allows them to improve the delivery of
healthcare to patients and to lower overall costs in the pharmaceutical supply channel.

Strategy

Our business strategy is focused solely on the pharmaceutical supply channel where we provide
value-added distribution and service solutions to healthcare providers (primarily pharmacies,
health systems, medical and dialysis clinics, and physicians) and pharmaceutical manufacturers that
increase channel efficiencies and improve patient outcomes. Implementing this disciplined, focused
strategy has allowed us to significantly expand our business, and we believe we are well-positioned
to continue to grow revenue and increase operating income through the execution of the following
key elements of our business strategy:

•

Optimize and Grow Our Pharmaceutical Distribution and Service Businesses.

We believe we
are well-positioned in size and market breadth to continue to grow our distribution business
as we invest to improve our operating and capital efficiencies. Distribution anchors our
growth and position in the pharmaceutical supply channel, as we provide superior
distribution services and deliver value-added solutions, which improve the efficiency and
competitiveness of both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers, thus allowing
the pharmaceutical supply channel to better deliver healthcare to patients.

With the rapid growth of generic pharmaceuticals in the U.S. market, we have introduced
strategies to enhance our position in the generic marketplace. We source generics globally,
offer a value-added generic formulary program to our healthcare provider customers, and monitor
our customers’ compliance with our generics program. We also provide data and other valuable
services to our generic manufacturing customers.

We believe we have one of the lowest cost operating structures among all pharmaceutical
distributors. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation has a distribution facility network totaling
26 distribution facilities in the U.S. We continue to seek opportunities to achieve
productivity and operating income gains as we invest in and continue to implement warehouse
automation technology, adopt “best practices” in warehousing activities, and increase operating
leverage by increasing volume per full-service distribution facility. Furthermore, we believe
that the investments we continue to make related to our Business Transformation project will
reduce our operating expenses in the future (see Information Systems on page 4 for further
details).

We offer value-added services and solutions to assist healthcare providers and pharmaceutical
manufacturers to improve their efficiency and their patient outcomes. Services for
manufacturers include: assistance with rapid new product launches, promotional and marketing
services to accelerate product sales, product data reporting and logistical support. In
addition, we provide packaging services to manufacturers, including contract packaging.

Our provider solutions include: our Good Neighbor Pharmacy

®

program, which enables
independent community pharmacies to compete more effectively through pharmaceutical benefit and
merchandising programs; Good Neighbor Pharmacy Provider Network

®

, our managed care
network, which connects our retail pharmacy customers to payor plans throughout the country and
is the fourth-largest in the U.S.; generic product purchasing services; hospital pharmacy
consulting designed to improve operational efficiencies; scalable automated pharmacy dispensing
equipment; and packaging services that deliver unit dose, punch card and other compliance
packaging for institutional and retail pharmacy customers.

In an effort to supplement our organic growth, we continue to utilize a disciplined approach to
seek acquisitions that will assist us with our strategic growth plans.

In fiscal 2009, we acquired Innomar Strategies Inc. (“Innomar”), a Canadian pharmaceutical
services company. Innomar provides services within Canada to pharmaceutical and biotechnology
companies, including strategic consulting and access solutions, specialty logistics management,
patient assistance and nursing services, and clinical research services. Innomar has increased
our distribution and services presence in Canada.



•

Optimize and Grow Our Specialty Distribution and Service Businesses

. Representing $15.5
billion in total revenue in fiscal 2011, our specialty pharmaceuticals business has a
significant presence in this growing part of the pharmaceutical supply channel. With
distribution and value-added services to physicians and other healthcare providers,
including dialysis clinics, our specialty pharmaceuticals business is a well-developed
platform for growth. We are the leader in distribution and services to community
oncologists and have leading positions in other physician-administered products. We also
distribute plasma and other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines.
Additionally, we are well-positioned to service and support many of the new biotechnology
therapies that will be coming to market in the near future.

The September 2011 acquisition of IntrinsiQ, LLC (“IntrinsiQ”) enhanced our proprietary
data offerings to both physicians and manufacturers. IntrinsiQ is a leading provider of
informatics solutions that help community oncologists make treatment decisions for their
patients. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our offerings in specialty distribution
and services.

•

Optimize and Grow Our Consulting and Packaging Services.

Our consulting service
businesses help pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers commercialize their
products in the channel. We believe we are the largest provider of reimbursement services
that assist pharmaceutical companies in supporting access to branded drugs. We also provide
outcomes research, contract field staffing, patient assistance and copay assistance
programs, adherence programs, risk mitigation services, and other market access programs to
pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, we are a leading provider of contract packaging and
we also provide clinical trial services for pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers.

The September 2011 acquisition of Premier Source complements our consulting and
reimbursement services. Premier Source is a provider of consulting and reimbursement services
to medical device, pharmaceutical, molecular diagnostic, and biotechnology manufacturers, as
well as other health services companies.

On November 1, 2011, we acquired TheraCom, LLC (“TheraCom”), which will significantly
increase the size and scope of our consulting services. TheraCom is a leading provider of
commercialization support services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, including
reimbursement and patient access support services. TheraCom’s capabilities complement those of
the Lash Group, which is part of AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services. We continue to seek
opportunities to expand our offerings in consulting and packaging services.

•

Divestitures.

In order to allow us to concentrate on our strategic focus areas of
pharmaceutical distribution and related services and specialty pharmaceutical distribution
and related services, we have divested certain non-core businesses and may, from time to
time, consider additional divestitures.

In October 2008, we sold PMSI, our workers’ compensation business.

Operations

Operating Structure.

We are organized based upon the products and services we provide to our
customers. Our operations as of September 30, 2011 are comprised of one reportable segment,
Pharmaceutical Distribution.

The Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment represents the consolidated operating
results of the Company and is comprised of four operating segments, which include the operations of
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (“ABDC”), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (“ABSG”),
AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (“ABCS”) and AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group (“ABPG”).
Servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply
channel, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related
services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. Prior to fiscal 2011,
the business operations of ABCS were included within ABSG.

ABDC distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals,
over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services
to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems,
independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and
other alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. ABDC also provides pharmacy management,
staffing and other consulting services; scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment;
medication and supply dispensing cabinets; and supply management software to a variety of retail
and institutional healthcare providers.

ABSG, through a number of operating businesses, provides pharmaceutical distribution and other
services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially
oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including dialysis clinics. ABSG also distributes
plasma and other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Additionally, ABSG
provides third party logistics and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical
manufacturers.



ABCS, through a number of operating businesses, provides commercialization support services
including reimbursement support programs, outcomes research, contract field staffing, patient
assistance and copay assistance programs, adherence programs, risk mitigation services, and other
market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers.

ABPG consists of American Health Packaging, Anderson Packaging (“Anderson”), and Brecon
Pharmaceuticals Limited (“Brecon”). American Health Packaging delivers unit dose, punch card,
unit-of-use, and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers.
American Health Packaging’s largest customer is ABDC and, as a result, its operations are closely
aligned with the operations of ABDC. Anderson and Brecon (based in the United Kingdom) are leading
providers of contract packaging and also provide clinical trials services for pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Beginning in fiscal 2012, to increase our operating efficiencies and to better align our
operations, each business unit within ABPG will be combined with ABDC or ABCS. More specifically,
the operations of American Health Packaging will be combined with the ABDC operating segment and
the operations of Anderson and Brecon will be combined with the ABCS operating segment.

Sales and Marketing.

The majority of ABDC’s sales force is organized regionally and
specialized by either healthcare provider type or size. Customer service representatives are
located in distribution facilities in order to respond to customer needs in a timely and effective
manner. ABDC also has support professionals focused on its various technologies and service
offerings. ABDC’s national marketing organization designs and develops business management
solutions for AmerisourceBergen healthcare provider customers. Tailored to specific groups, these
programs can be further customized at the business unit or distribution facility level to adapt to
local market conditions. ABDC’s sales and marketing organization also serves national account
customers through close coordination with local distribution centers and ensures that our customers
are receiving service offerings that meet their needs. Our other operating segments each have
independent sales forces and marketing organizations that specialize in their respective product
and service offerings. In addition, we have a corporate marketing group that coordinates branding
and other marketing activities across the Company.

Customers.

We have a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare
providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers. Institutional healthcare providers include
acute care hospitals, health systems, mail order pharmacies, long-term care and other alternate
care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities, and physicians and physician
group practices. Retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore
chains, independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass
merchandisers. We are typically the primary source of supply for our healthcare provider
customers. Our manufacturing customers include branded, generic and biotechnology manufacturers of
prescription pharmaceuticals, as well as over-the-counter product and health and beauty aid
manufacturers. In addition, we offer a broad range of value-added solutions designed to enhance
the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of our customers, thereby allowing them to
improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers. In fiscal 2011, total revenue was
comprised of 71% institutional customers and 29% retail customers.

In fiscal 2011, Medco Health Solutions, Inc., our largest customer, accounted for 19% of our
revenue. Our next largest customer accounted for 5.5% of our fiscal 2011 revenue. Our top 10
customers represented approximately 43% of fiscal 2011 revenue. In addition, we have contracts
with group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on
behalf of its members, who are healthcare providers. Approximately 10% of our revenue in fiscal
2011 was derived from our three largest GPO relationships. The loss of any major customer or GPO
relationship could adversely affect future revenue and results of operations.

Suppliers.

We obtain pharmaceutical and other products from manufacturers, none of which
accounted for 10% or more of our purchases in fiscal 2011. The loss of a supplier could adversely
affect our business if alternate sources of supply are unavailable since we are committed to be the
primary source of pharmaceutical products for a majority of our customers. We believe that our
relationships with our suppliers are good. The 10 largest suppliers in fiscal 2011 accounted for
approximately 51% of our purchases.

Information Systems.

ABDC operates its full-service wholesale pharmaceutical distribution
facilities in the U.S. on a centralized system. ABDC’s operating system provides for, among other
things, electronic order entry by customers, invoice preparation and purchasing, and inventory
tracking. As a result of electronic order entry, the cost of receiving and processing orders has
not increased as rapidly as sales volume. ABDC’s systems are intended to strengthen customer
relationships by allowing the customer to lower its operating costs and by providing a platform for
a number of the basic and value-added services offered to our customers, including marketing,
product demand data, inventory replenishment, single-source billing, third party claims processing,
computer price updates and price labels.

ABDC continues to expand its electronic interface with its suppliers and currently processes a
substantial portion of its purchase orders, invoices and payments electronically. ABDC has a
warehouse operating system, which is used to account for the majority of ABDC’s transactional
volume. The warehouse operating system has improved ABDC’s productivity and operating leverage.
ABDC will continue to invest in advanced information systems and automated warehouse technology.



A significant portion of our information technology activities relating to ABDC and our
corporate functions are outsourced to IBM Global Services and other third party service providers.

In an effort to continue to make system investments to further improve our information
technology capabilities and meet our future customer and operational needs, we began to make
significant investments in fiscal 2008 relating to our Business Transformation project that
includes a new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. The ERP system will include the
development and implementation of integrated processes to enhance our business practices and lower
costs. Effective October 2010, the majority of our corporate and administrative functions began
operating on our new ERP system. Additionally, in fiscal 2011, two of our ABDC distribution
facilities implemented and began using PassPort, our new web-based customer facing application with
enhanced ordering and product catalog features. We expect to continue the implementation of the
ERP system, including PassPort, and as a result, expect to continue to make significant
investments in our Business Transformation project.

ABSG operates the majority of its business on its own common, centralized platform resulting
in operating efficiencies as well as the ability to rapidly deploy new capabilities.

Competition

We face a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related
healthcare services. Our largest national competitors are Cardinal Health, Inc. (“Cardinal”) and
McKesson Corporation (“McKesson”). ABDC competes with both Cardinal and McKesson, as well as
national generic distributors and regional distributors within pharmaceutical distribution. In
addition, we compete with manufacturers who sell directly to customers, chain drugstores who manage
their own warehousing, specialty distributors, and packaging and healthcare technology companies.
The distribution and related service businesses in which ABSG engages are also highly competitive.
ABSG’s operating businesses face competition from a variety of competitors, including McKesson,
Cardinal, FFF Enterprises, Henry Schein, Inc., Express Scripts, Inc., and UPS Logistics, among
others. Our Consulting and Packaging businesses also face competition from a variety of
competitors. In all areas, competitive factors include price, product offerings, value-added
service programs, service and delivery, credit terms, and customer support.

Intellectual Property

We use a number of trademarks and service marks. All of the principal trademarks and service
marks used in the course of our business have been registered in the United States and, in some
cases, in foreign jurisdictions or are the subject of pending applications for registration.

We have developed or acquired various proprietary products, processes, software and other
intellectual property that are used either to facilitate the conduct of our business or that are
made available as products or services to customers. We generally seek to protect such
intellectual property through a combination of trade secret, patent and copyright laws and through
confidentiality and other contractually imposed protections.

We hold patents and have patent applications pending that relate to certain of our products,
particularly our automated pharmacy dispensing equipment, our medication and supply dispensing
equipment, certain warehousing equipment and some of our proprietary packaging solutions. We seek
patent protection for our proprietary intellectual property from time to time as appropriate.

Although we believe that our patents or other proprietary products and processes do not
infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third parties, third parties may assert
infringement claims against us from time to time.

Employees

As of September 30, 2011, we had approximately 10,300 employees, of which approximately 9,400
were full-time employees. Approximately 4.5% of our employees are covered by collective bargaining
agreements. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. If any of our employees
in locations that are unionized should engage in strikes or other such bargaining tactics in
connection with the negotiation of new collective bargaining agreements upon the expiration of any
existing collective bargaining agreements, such tactics could be disruptive to our operations and
adversely affect our results of operations, but we believe we have adequate contingency plans in
place to assure delivery of pharmaceuticals to our customers in the event of any such disruptions.



Government Regulation

We are subject to oversight by various federal and state governmental entities and we are
subject to, and affected by, a variety of federal and state laws, regulations and policies.

The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”) and various state regulatory authorities regulate the purchase, storage, and/or
distribution of pharmaceutical products, including controlled substances. Wholesale distributors
of controlled substances must hold valid DEA licenses, meet various security and operating
standards and comply with regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and
distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad
enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend our distribution centers from distributing
controlled substances, seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, civil and
administrative sanctions. We have all necessary licenses or other regulatory approvals and believe
that we are in compliance with all applicable pharmaceutical wholesale distribution requirements
needed to conduct our operations.

We and our customers are subject to fraud and abuse laws, including federal anti-kickback
statutes. The anti-kickback statutes prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or
paying any remuneration in order to induce the purchasing, leasing or ordering, induce a referral
to purchase, lease or order, or arrange for or recommend purchasing, leasing or ordering items or
services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs.
The fraud and abuse laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to frequent
modification and varied interpretation.

In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations that are intended to
protect the safety of the pharmaceutical supply channel. These laws and regulations are designed
to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, diverted, adulterated or mislabeled pharmaceuticals
into the distribution system. For example, Florida has adopted pedigree tracking requirements and
California has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using an interoperable
electronic system utilizing unique identification numbers on prescription drugs to create
electronic pedigrees, which will be effective for us in July 2016. These and other requirements
are expected to increase the cost of our operations.

At the federal level, final regulations issued pursuant to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act
became effective in December 2006. These FDA regulations impose pedigree and other chain of
custody requirements that increase our costs and/or burden of selling to other pharmaceutical
distributors and handling product returns. In addition, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 requires
the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies to secure the
pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. These standards may include track-and-trace
and/or authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the manufacturer to the
sellable units and cases. The FDA is also required to develop a standardized numerical identifier
(“SNI”), which would be coded into the data carrier applied by the manufacturer. In March 2010,
the FDA issued guidance regarding the development of SNIs for prescription drug packages in which
the FDA identified package-level SNIs, as an initial step in the FDA’s development and
implementation of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain.

Federal legislation known as the Affordable Care Act became law in March 2010. The Affordable
Care Act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured
Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies
and health insurance mandates. When fully implemented, these provisions are expected to increase
the number of people in the United States who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of
their prescription drug costs. The Affordable Care Act contains many provisions designed to
generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of Medicare
and Medicaid. In addition, the Affordable Care Act changed the formula for federal upper limits
for multiple source drugs available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide
basis to no less than 175% of the weighted average manufacturer price. While certain provisions of
the Affordable Care Act took effect immediately, others have delayed effective dates.

As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, scrutiny of the healthcare
delivery system in the United States can be expected to continue at both the state and federal
levels. This process may result in additional legislation and/or regulation governing the delivery
or pricing of pharmaceutical products, as well as additional changes to the structure of the
present healthcare delivery system. We cannot predict what additional initiatives, if any, will be
adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.

The costs, burdens, and/or impacts of complying with federal and state regulations could be
significant and the failure to comply with any such legal requirements could have a significant
impact on our results of operations and financial condition.

See “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of additional regulatory developments that may
affect our results of operations and financial condition.



Health Information Practices

The Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and its
accompanying federal regulations set forth health information standards in order to protect
security and privacy in the exchange of individually identifiable health information. In addition,
our operations, depending on their location, may be subject to state or foreign regulations
affecting personal data protection and the manner in which information services or products are
provided. Significant criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for violation of HIPAA standards
and other such laws. We have a HIPAA compliance program to facilitate our ongoing effort to comply
with the HIPAA regulations.

Enacted in 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (“ARRA”) strengthens federal
privacy and security provisions to protect personally-identifiable health information, including by
imposing new notification requirements related to health data security breaches. The ARRA also
provides incentive payments to eligible healthcare providers participating in Medicare and Medicaid
programs that adopt certified electronic health record (“HER”) technology. The Electronic
Prescribing (eRx) Incentive Program provides incentives for eligible healthcare providers who are
successful electronic prescribers; beginning in 2012, eligible providers who are not successful
electronic prescribers may be subject to a reduction in their Medicare physician fee schedule
payments (unless they receive a significant hardship exemption). There can be no assurances that
compliance with the new privacy requirements and compliance with EHR standards will not impose new
costs on our business.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

The following discussion describes certain risk factors that we believe could affect our
business and prospects. These risks factors are in addition to those set forth elsewhere in this
report.

Intense competition as well as industry consolidations may erode our profit margins.

The distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare solutions is highly competitive.
We compete with two national wholesale distributors of pharmaceuticals, Cardinal and McKesson;
regional and local distributors of pharmaceuticals; national generic distributors; chain drugstores
that warehouse their own pharmaceuticals; manufacturers that distribute their products directly to
customers; specialty distributors; and packaging and healthcare technology companies (see
“Competition”). Competition continues to increase in specialty distribution and services, where
gross margins historically have been higher than in ABDC. Reflecting that increased competition,
our two national competitors have recently completed acquisitions to expand their footprint in the
area of specialty distribution and services. If we were forced by competition to reduce our prices
or offer more favorable payment or other terms, our results of operations or liquidity could be
adversely affected. In addition, in recent years, the healthcare industry has been subject to
increasing consolidation. If this trend continues among our customers and suppliers, it could give
the resulting enterprises greater bargaining power, which may lead to greater pressure to reduce
prices for our products and services.

Our results of operations continue to be subject to the risks and uncertainties of inflation
in branded pharmaceutical prices and deflation in generic pharmaceutical prices.

Certain distribution service agreements that we have entered into with branded pharmaceutical
manufacturers continue to have an inflation-based compensation component to them. Arrangements
with a small number of branded manufacturers continue to be solely inflation-based. As a result,
approximately 8% of our gross profit from brand-name manufacturers continues to be subject to
fluctuation based upon the timing and extent of manufacturer price increases. If the frequency or
rate of branded pharmaceutical price increases slows, our results of operations could be adversely
affected. In addition, we distribute generic pharmaceuticals, which are subject to price
deflation. If the frequency or rate of generic pharmaceutical price deflation accelerates, our
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Declining economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

Our operations and performance depend on economic conditions in the United States and other
countries where we do business. Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely
affect the amount of prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products
purchased by consumers and, therefore, reduce purchases by our customers, which would negatively
affect our revenue growth and cause a decrease in our profitability. Interest rate fluctuations,
financial market volatility or credit market disruptions may also negatively affect our customers’
ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our
customers or changes in payment terms could adversely affect our revenue growth and cause a
decrease in our cash flow from operations. Bankruptcies or similar events affecting our customers
may cause us to incur bad debt expense at levels higher than historically experienced. Declining
economic conditions may also increase our costs. If the economic conditions in the United States
or in the regions outside the United States where we do business do not improve or deteriorate, our
results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.

Our stock price and our ability to access credit markets may be adversely affected by financial
market volatility and disruption.

Despite our recent success amending our multi-currency revolving credit facility, amending our
receivables securitization facility, and issuing $500 million of ten-year senior notes, in recent
years, the capital and credit markets have experienced significant volatility and disruption. For
example, in the latter half of 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009, the markets produced downward
pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those
issuers’ underlying financial strength. If the markets return to the levels of disruption and
volatility experienced in the latter half of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, there can be no
assurance that we will not experience downward movement in our stock price without regard to our
financial condition or results of operations or an adverse effect, which may be material, on our
ability to access credit generally, and on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results
of operations.



Our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows may suffer upon the loss of a significant
customer.

Our largest customer, Medco Health Solutions, Inc., accounted for 19% of our revenue in fiscal
2011. Our top ten customers represented approximately 43% of fiscal 2011 revenue. In July 2011,
Medco announced its intention to merge with Express Scripts, Inc., which will be the surviving
corporation and is a customer of one of our competitors. Our business with Medco contributes
approximately 5% of our earnings. Our current contract with Medco continues at least through March
2013. We will make every effort to extend our relationship with the combined entity upon the
expiration of our current contract; however, if we fail to do so, our revenue, earnings and cash flows would be significantly impacted. We also have contracts with
group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), each of which functions as a purchasing agent on behalf of
its members, who are hospitals, pharmacies or other healthcare providers. Approximately 10% of our
revenue in fiscal 2011 was derived from our three largest GPO relationships. We may lose a
significant customer or GPO relationship if any existing contract with such customer or GPO expires
without being extended, renewed, renegotiated or replaced or is terminated by the customer or GPO
prior to expiration, to the extent such early termination is permitted by the contract. A number
of our contracts with significant customers or GPOs are typically subject to expiration each year
and we may lose any of these customers or GPO relationships if we are unable to extend, renew,
renegotiate or replace the contracts. The loss of any significant customer or GPO relationship
could adversely affect our revenue, results of operations, and cash flows.

Our revenue and results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit
failure of a significant customer.

Most of our customers buy pharmaceuticals and other products and services from us on credit.
Credit is made available to customers based on our assessment and analysis of creditworthiness.
Although we often try to obtain a security interest in assets and other arrangements intended to
protect our credit exposure, we generally are either subordinated to the position of the primary
lenders to our customers or substantially unsecured. Volatility of the capital and credit markets,
general economic conditions, and regulatory changes, including changes in reimbursement, may
adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our customers. The bankruptcy, insolvency or
other credit failure of any customer that has a substantial amount owed to us could have a material
adverse affect on our operating revenue and results of operations. At September 30, 2011, our two
largest trade receivable balances due from customers represented approximately 11% and 10% of
accounts receivable, net.

Our results of operations may suffer upon the bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of a
significant supplier.

Our relationships with pharmaceutical suppliers, including generic pharmaceutical
manufacturers, give rise to substantial amounts that are due to us from the suppliers, including
amounts owed to us for returned goods or defective goods, chargebacks, and amounts due to us for
services provided to the suppliers. Volatility of the capital and credit markets, general economic
conditions, and regulatory changes may adversely affect the solvency or creditworthiness of our
suppliers. The bankruptcy, insolvency or other credit failure of any supplier at a time when the
supplier has a substantial account payable balance due to us could have a material adverse affect
on our results of operations.

Increasing governmental efforts to regulate the pharmaceutical supply channel may increase our
costs and reduce our profitability.

The healthcare industry is highly regulated at the federal and state levels. Consequently, we
are subject to the risk of changes in various federal and state laws, which include operating and
security standards of the DEA, the FDA, various state boards of pharmacy and comparable agencies.

In recent years, some states have passed or proposed laws and regulations, including laws and
regulations obligating pharmaceutical distributors to provide prescription drug pedigrees, that are
intended to protect the safety of the supply channel but that also may substantially increase the
costs and burden of pharmaceutical distribution. For example, Florida has adopted pedigree
tracking requirements and California has enacted a law requiring chain of custody technology using
an interoperable electronic system utilizing unique identification numbers on prescription drugs to
create electronic pedigrees, which will be effective for us in July 2016. In order to comply with
the Florida requirements, we implemented an e-pedigree system at our distribution center in Florida
that required significant capital outlays.

At the federal level, final regulations issued pursuant to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act
became effective in December 2006. The FDA regulations impose pedigree and other chain of custody
requirements that increase the costs and/or burden to us of selling to other pharmaceutical
distributors and handling product returns. In addition, the FDA Amendments Act of 2007 requires
the FDA to establish standards and identify and validate effective technologies for the purpose of
securing the pharmaceutical supply chain against counterfeit drugs. These standards may include
track-and-trace and/or authentication technologies that leverage data carriers applied by the
manufacturer to the sellable units and cases. The FDA is also required to develop a standardized
numerical identifier (“SNI”). In March 2010, FDA issued guidance regarding the development of SNIs
for prescription drug packages in which the FDA identified package-level SNIs, as an initial step
in the FDA’s development of additional measures to secure the drug supply chain. The increased
costs of complying with these pedigree and other supply chain custody requirements could increase
our costs or otherwise significantly affect our results of operations.



The suspension or revocation by the DEA of any of the registrations that must be in effect for our
distribution facilities to purchase, store and distribute controlled substances or the refusal by
the DEA to issue a registration to any such facility that requires such registration may adversely
affect our reputation, our business and our results of operations.

The DEA, FDA and various state regulatory authorities regulate the distribution of
pharmaceuticals and controlled substances. We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level
licenses, meet various security and operating standards and comply with the Controlled Substance
Act and its accompanying regulations governing the sale, marketing, packaging, holding and
distribution of controlled substances. The DEA, FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad
enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend our distribution centers’ licenses to
distribute pharmaceutical products (including controlled substances), seize or recall products and
impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and
regulations.

In 2007, our Orlando, Florida distribution center’s license to distribute controlled
substances and listed chemicals was suspended and later reinstated under an agreement with the DEA,
when we implemented an enhanced and more sophisticated order-monitoring program in all of our ABDC
distribution centers. In addition, in 2008, one of our subsidiaries, Bellco Drug Corp., received a
new DEA registration (following the suspension of its license and entry into a consent judgment
with the DEA prior to our acquisition of the business). While we expect to continue to comply with
all of the DEA’s requirements, there can be no assurance that the DEA will not require further
controls against the diversion of controlled substances in the future or will not take similar
action against any other of our distribution centers in the future.

Legal, regulatory and legislative changes reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or
medical treatments or services may adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Both our business and our customers’ businesses may be adversely affected by laws and
regulations reducing reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and/or medical treatments or services
or changing the methodology by which reimbursement levels are determined.

Federal legislation known as the Affordable Care Act became law in March 2010. The Affordable
Care Act is intended to expand health insurance coverage to more than 30 million uninsured
Americans through a combination of insurance market reforms, an expansion of Medicaid, subsidies
and health insurance mandates. When fully implemented, these provisions are expected to increase
the number of people in the United States who have insurance coverage for at least a portion of
prescription drug costs. The Affordable Care Act contains many provisions designed to generate the
revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions and reduce the costs of Medicare and Medicaid.
While certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act took effect immediately, others have delayed
effective dates. Given the scope of the changes made by the Affordable Care Act and the ongoing
implementation efforts, we cannot predict the impact of every aspect of the new law on our
operations.

The Affordable Care Act changed the formula for federal upper limits for multiple source drugs
available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis to a limit of not less
than 175% of the weighted average manufacturer price (“AMP”). The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services (“CMS”) have released for review and comment a draft federal upper limit methodology and
draft federal upper limits determined by using that methodology. While the draft federal upper
limit prices released to date would represent a significant reduction from the federal upper limits
currently in place, the impact of the CMS methodology cannot be determined until finalized. Any
reduction in the Medicaid reimbursement rates to our customers for certain multisource
pharmaceuticals may indirectly impact the prices that we can charge our customers for multisource
pharmaceuticals and cause corresponding declines in our profitability.

The Affordable Care Act also amends the Medicaid rebate statute to increase minimum Medicaid
rebates paid by pharmaceutical manufacturers and make other changes affecting Medicaid rebate
amounts. The Affordable Care Act’s redefinition of AMP is expected to result, in most instances,
in a higher AMP. This higher AMP, coupled with the higher minimum Medicaid rebate percentage, is
expected to result in increased Medicaid rebate payments by pharmaceutical manufacturers, which
could indirectly impact our business. We are currently assessing the potential impact of these
provisions on our business. The federal government could take other actions in the future that
impact Medicaid reimbursement and rebate amounts. There can be no assurance that recent or future
changes in prescription drug reimbursement policies will not have an adverse impact on our
business. Unless we are able to develop plans to mitigate the potential impact of these legislative
and regulatory changes, these changes in reimbursement and related reporting requirements could
adversely affect our results of operations.

In February 2011, the federal Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) announced that
it would be conducting a national survey of pharmacies to create a national database of average
actual pharmacy acquisition costs, the results of which states may use to determine state-specific
pharmaceutical reimbursement rates. There can be no assurances that state pharmaceutical rates
derived from this new data will not result in lower Medicaid reimbursement levels that could
adversely impact our business.



Our revenue growth rate has been negatively impacted by a reduction in sales of certain anemia
drugs, primarily those used in oncology, and may, in the future, be adversely affected by any
further reductions in sales or restrictions on the use of anemia drugs or a decrease in Medicare
reimbursement for these drugs. Several developments contributed to the decline in sales of anemia
drugs, including expanded warning and product safety labeling requirements, more restrictive
federal policies governing Medicare reimbursement for the use of these drugs to treat oncology
patients with kidney failure and dialysis and more conservative guidelines for recommended dosage
and use. Any further changes in the recommended dosage or use of anemia drugs or reductions in
reimbursement for such drugs could result in slower growth or lower revenues. In addition, on
January 1, 2011, CMS began implementing a prospective payment system for Medicare end-stage renal
disease (ESRD) services that provides a single bundled payment to dialysis facilities covering most
ESRD services, including anemia drugs. There is a 4-year transition period to the new prospective
payment system. We cannot at this time assess the impact this new payment system, when fully
implemented, will have on our business. Our sales of anemia drugs, including those used in
oncology, represented approximately 4% of revenue in fiscal 2011.

The Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 significantly
expanded Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program.
The Part D Plan program has increased the use of pharmaceuticals in the supply channel, which has a
positive impact on our revenues and profitability. There have been additional changes to the Part
D program since its enactment. Notably, the Affordable Care Act provides additional assistance to
beneficiaries who reach the Part D “coverage gap” (including a manufacturer discount program),
mandates additional medication therapy management services and reduces Part D subsidies for certain
high-income beneficiaries. CMS continues to issue regulations and other guidance to implement
these statutory changes and further refine Medicare Part D program rules. There can be no
assurances that recent and future changes to the Part D program will not have an adverse impact on
our business.

The federal government may adopt measures in the future that would further reduce Medicare
and/or Medicaid spending or impose additional requirements on health care entities. For instance,
the Budget Control Act of 2011 established a Congressional committee charged with identifying $1.5
trillion in deficit reduction provisions, which could include reductions in Medicare and/or
Medicaid spending. If legislation meeting deficit reduction targets is not adopted by January
2012, a total of $1.2 trillion in spending reductions affecting a variety of programs would
automatically go into effect in January 2013. Reductions in payments to Medicare providers under
this process would be capped at 2%, while Medicaid would be exempt from such reductions. Any
future reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates could negatively impact our customers’ businesses
and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us. At this time, we can provide no
assurances that future Medicare and/or Medicaid payment or policy changes, if adopted, would not
have an adverse effect on our business.

ABSG’s business may be adversely affected in the future by the impact of declining
reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals and other economic factors.

ABSG sells specialty drugs directly to physicians and community oncology practices and
provides a number of services to or through physicians. Drugs that are administered in a
physician’s office, such as drugs that are infused or injected, are typically covered under
Medicare Part B. Declining reimbursement rates for Medicare Part B drugs and other economic
factors have caused a number of physician practices, including some customers, to move from private
practice to hospital settings, where they may purchase their specialty drugs under hospital prime
vendor arrangements rather than from specialty distributors like ABSG. This trend may continue due
to various factors, including legislative and regulatory requirements that affect how CMS
calculates average sales price (“ASP”) for Medicare Part B drugs. Because Medicare currently
reimburses physicians for Part B drugs at the rate of ASP plus six percent, changes in ASP have
reduced and could continue to reduce Medicare reimbursement rates for some Part B drugs. These
reductions could accelerate the trend of physician practices moving to or being acquired by
hospitals, and could also indirectly impact the prices we can charge our customers for
pharmaceuticals and result in corresponding declines in ABSG’s profitability. In addition, deficit
reduction measures pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011 could include reductions in Medicare
spending, such as lower reimbursement rates for Medicare Part B drugs. Any future reductions in
the rate of reimbursement for drugs covered under Medicare Part B could negatively impact our
customers’ businesses and their ability to continue to purchase such drugs from us. At this time,
we can provide no assurances that future Medicare reimbursement or policy changes, if adopted,
would not have an adverse effect on our business.

Changes to the United States healthcare environment may negatively impact our business and our
profitability.

Our products and services are intended to function within the structure of the healthcare
financing and reimbursement system currently existing in the United States. In recent years, the
healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce costs and government
spending. These changes include an increased reliance on managed care; cuts in certain Medicare
funding affecting our healthcare provider customer base; consolidation of competitors, suppliers
and customers; and the development of large, sophisticated purchasing groups. We expect the
healthcare industry to continue to change significantly in the future. Some of these potential
changes, such as a reduction in governmental funding at the state or federal level for certain
healthcare services or adverse changes in legislation or regulations governing prescription drug
pricing, healthcare services or mandated benefits, may cause healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of our products and services they
purchase or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. We expect continued
government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical
manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability.



If we fail to comply with laws and regulations in respect of healthcare fraud and abuse, we could
suffer penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations.

We are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state laws and regulations
relating to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal government continues to strengthen its
position and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting Medicare, Medicaid and
other government healthcare programs. Our relationships with healthcare providers and
pharmaceutical manufacturers subject our business to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which,
among other things, (i) prohibit persons from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any
remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient for treatment or the ordering or
purchasing of items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other
government-sponsored healthcare programs and (ii) impose a number of restrictions upon referring
physicians and providers of designated health services under Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse give federal enforcement personnel
substantially increased funding, powers and remedies to pursue suspected fraud and abuse, and these
enforcement authorities were further expanded by the Affordable Care Act. While we believe that we
are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, many of the regulations applicable to
us, including those relating to marketing incentives offered in connection with pharmaceutical
sales, are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be
interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could
require us to make changes in our operations. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and
regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, including the loss of licenses or our
ability to participate in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs.

The enactment of provincial legislation or regulations in Canada to lower pharmaceutical product
pricing and service fees may adversely affect our pharmaceutical distribution business in Canada,
including the profitability of that business.

Consistent with our operations in the United States, our products and services function within
the existing regulatory structure of the healthcare system in Canada. The purchase of
pharmaceutical products in Canada is funded in part by the provincial governments, which each
regulate the financing and reimbursement of drugs independently. In recent years, like the United
States, the Canadian healthcare industry has undergone significant changes in an effort to reduce
costs and government spending. For example, in 2006, the Ontario government enacted the
Transparent Drug System for Patients Act, which significantly revised the drug distribution system
in Ontario. On July 1, 2010, the Ontario government finalized regulatory changes to reform the
rules regarding the sale of generic drugs in Ontario to reduce costs for taxpayers. These changes
include the significant lowering of prices for generic pharmaceuticals in both the public
(government-sponsored plans) and private markets and the elimination of professional allowances
paid to pharmacists. Changes in generic drug prices also affect the cash values of the percentage
mark-ups that may be charged by pharmacies. These reforms may result in lower service fees, cause
healthcare industry participants to reduce the amount of products and services they purchase from
us or the price they are willing to pay for our products and services. In addition, any fees based
on percentage of drug prices will be reduced by any reductions to generic drug prices themselves.
Legislation and/or regulations that may lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees are
reportedly under consideration by some other provinces as well. The legislative changes in Ontario
had an immediate impact on Quebec because it requires manufacturers to sell pharmaceuticals to
Quebec at the lowest price in Canada. The governments of Alberta and British Columbia have also
taken steps to reduce the prices for generic drugs listed on their formularies. We expect continued
government and private payor pressure to reduce pharmaceutical pricing. Changes in pharmaceutical
manufacturers’ pricing or distribution policies could also significantly reduce our profitability
in Canada. Revenue from our Canadian operations in fiscal 2011 was less than 2% of our
consolidated revenue.

Our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by qui tam litigation.

Violations of various federal and state laws governing the marketing, sale and purchase of
pharmaceutical products can result in criminal, civil, and administrative liability for which there
can be significant financial damages, criminal and civil penalties, and possible exclusion from
participation in federal and state health programs. Among other things, such violations can form
the basis for qui tam complaints to be filed. The qui tam provisions of the federal and various
state civil False Claims Acts authorize a private person, known as a relator, to file civil actions
under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments. Under False Claims Acts, the
filing of a qui tam complaint by a relator imposes obligations on government authorities to
investigate the allegations and determine whether or not to intervene in the action. Such cases
may involve allegations around the marketing, sale and/or purchase of branded pharmaceutical
products and wrongdoing in the marketing, sale and/or purchase of such products. Such complaints
are filed under seal and remain sealed until the applicable court orders otherwise. Our business
and results of operations could be adversely affected if qui tam complaints are filed against us
for alleged violations of any health laws and regulations and damages arising from resultant false
claims, if government authorities decide to intervene in any such matters and/or we are found
liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such matters.



On October 24, 2011, we announced that we had reached a preliminary agreement for a civil
settlement (the “Preliminary Settlement”) with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern
District of New York, the plaintiff states and the relator (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”) of the
claims in a civil case that was filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts (the “District of Massachusetts case”) under the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil False Claims Acts
against two business units of the Company, which are subsidiaries of AmerisourceBergen Specialty
Group: International Nephrology Network (“INN”), a group purchasing organization for nephrologists
and nephrology practices, and ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc. (“ASD”), which is a distributor of
pharmaceuticals to physician practices. The relator was a former
employee of Amgen, Inc., which was
also a defendant in the case. The civil case was administratively closed after the Preliminary
Settlement was reached. The Preliminary Settlement is subject to completion and approval of an
executed written settlement agreement with the Plaintiffs, which we expect to finalize in fiscal
year 2012. We do not expect INN or ASD to admit any liability in connection with the settlement.
We recorded a $16 million charge in fiscal 2011 in connection with the Preliminary Settlement. The
matter is described in Note 12 (Legal Matters and Contingencies) of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In addition, we have learned that there are prior and subsequent filings in one or more
federal district courts, including a complaint filed by one of our former employees, that are under
seal and involve allegations against the Company (and/or subsidiaries or businesses of the Company,
including our group purchasing organization for oncologists and our oncology distribution business)
similar to those raised in the District of Massachusetts case. The
Preliminary Settlement encompasses resolution of one of these other filings. With regard to any of these
filings not encompassed by the Preliminary Settlement, our business and results of operations could
be adversely affected if government authorities decide to intervene in any such pending cases
and/or we are found liable for all or any portion of violations alleged in any such pending cases.

Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected if we undertake
acquisitions of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are difficult for us to
integrate.

We expect to continue to implement our growth strategy, in part, by acquiring companies. At
any particular time, we may be in various stages of assessment, discussion and negotiation with
regard to one or more potential acquisitions, not all of which will be consummated. We make public
disclosure of pending and completed acquisitions when appropriate and required by applicable
securities laws and regulations.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties. If we complete one or more
acquisitions, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by a
number of factors, including: the failure of the acquired businesses to achieve the results we have
projected in either the near or long term; the assumption of unknown liabilities; the fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are not properly estimated; the difficulties of imposing
adequate financial and operating controls on the acquired companies and their management and the
potential liabilities that might arise pending the imposition of adequate controls; the
difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, services and products of the
acquired companies; and the failure to achieve the strategic objectives of these acquisitions.

Our results of operations and our financial condition may be adversely affected by foreign
operations.

We have pharmaceutical distribution operations based in Canada and provide contract packaging
and clinical trials materials services in the United Kingdom. We may consider additional foreign
acquisitions in the future. Our existing foreign operations and any operations we may acquire in
the future carry risks in addition to the risks of acquisition, as described above. At any
particular time, foreign operations may encounter risks and uncertainties regarding the
governmental, political, economic, business and competitive environment within the countries in
which those operations are based. Additionally, foreign operations expose us to foreign currency
fluctuations that could impact our results of operations and financial condition based on the
movements of the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the U.S. dollar.

Risks generally associated with our sophisticated information systems may adversely affect our
business and results of operations.

Our businesses rely on sophisticated information systems to obtain, rapidly process, analyze,
and manage data to facilitate the purchase and distribution of thousands of inventory items from
numerous distribution centers; to receive, process, and ship orders on a timely basis; to account
for other product and service transactions with customers; to manage the accurate billing and
collections for thousands of customers; and to process payments to suppliers. Our business and
results of operations may be adversely affected if these systems are interrupted or damaged by
unforeseen events or if they fail for any extended period of time, including due to the actions of
third parties.

Information security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the
proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators
of cyber attacks. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or
those of our third party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security
breaches could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary
information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses. As a result, cyber
security and the continued development and enhancement of the controls and processes designed to
protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage or unauthorized
access remain a priority for us. Although we believe that we have robust information security
procedures and other safeguards in place, as cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required
to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to
investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.



Third party service providers are responsible for managing a significant portion of our
information systems. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the third
party service provider does not perform satisfactorily.

Certain of our businesses continue to make substantial investments in information systems. To
the extent the implementation of these systems fail, our business and results of operations may be
adversely affected.

Risks generally associated with implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system may
adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of internal control
over financial reporting.

We have begun to implement an ERP system, which, when completed, will handle the business and
financial processes within ABDC’s operations and our corporate and administrative functions, such
as: (i) facilitating the purchase and distribution of inventory items from our distribution
centers; (ii) receiving, processing, and shipping orders on a timely basis, (iii) managing the
accuracy of billings and collections for our customers; (iv) processing payments to our suppliers;
and (v) generating financial transactions and information. ERP implementations are complex and
time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation
activities that can continue for several years. ERP implementations also require transformation of
business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system. Our business and
results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems and/or cost
overruns during the ERP implementation process or if the ERP system, and the associated process
changes, do not give rise to the benefits that we expect.

Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or if the system
does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting systems, our
ability to produce financial reports, and/or the effectiveness of our internal controls over
financial reporting.

Tax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results
of operations and financial condition.

We are a large corporation with operations in the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and the
United Kingdom. As such, we are subject to tax laws and regulations of the United States federal,
state and local governments and of certain foreign jurisdictions. From time to time, various
legislative initiatives may be proposed that could adversely affect our tax positions and/or our
tax liabilities. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be
adversely affected by these initiatives. In addition, United States federal, state and local, as
well as foreign, tax laws and regulations, are extremely complex and subject to varying
interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will not be challenged by
relevant tax authorities or that we would be successful in any such challenge.

STOCK PERFORMANCE GRAPH

This graph depicts the Company’s five year cumulative total stockholder returns relative to
the performance of the Standard and Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Index, the S&P Health Care Index,
and an index of peer companies selected by the Company from the market close on September 30, 2006
to September 30, 2011. The graph assumes $100 invested at the closing price of the common stock of
the Company and of each of the other indices on the New York Stock Exchange on September 30, 2006.
The points on the graph represent fiscal year-end index levels based on the last trading day in
each fiscal quarter. The historical prices of the Company’s common stock reflect the downward
adjustment of approximately 3% that was made by the NYSE in all of the historical prices to reflect
the July 2007 divestiture of Long-Term Care. The Peer Group index (which is weighted on the basis
of market capitalization) consists of the following companies engaged primarily in wholesale
pharmaceutical distribution and related services: Cardinal Health, Inc. and McKesson Corporation.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Overview

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto contained herein.

We are a pharmaceutical services company providing drug distribution and related healthcare
services and solutions to our pharmacy, physician, and manufacturer customers, which are based
primarily in the United States and Canada. We are organized based upon the products and services we
provide to our customers. Substantially all of our operations are located in the United States and
Canada. We also have a pharmaceutical packaging operation in the United Kingdom.

Acquisitions

In September 2011, we acquired IntrinsiQ, LLC (“IntrinsiQ”) for a purchase price of $34.3
million, net of a working capital adjustment. IntrinsiQ is a leading provider of informatics
solutions that help community oncologists make treatment decisions for their patients. The
acquisition of IntrinsiQ enhanced our proprietary data offerings to both physicians and
manufacturers.

In September 2011, we acquired Premier Source (“Premier”) for a purchase price of $11.1
million, net of cash acquired. Premier is a provider of consulting and reimbursement services to
medical device, pharmaceutical, molecular diagnostic, and biotechnology manufacturers, as well as
other health services companies. The acquisition of Premier complements the services provided by
our consulting business.

On November 1, 2011, we acquired TheraCom, LLC (“TheraCom”), a subsidiary of CVS Caremark
Corporation, for a purchase price of $250.0 million, subject to a working capital adjustment.
TheraCom is a leading provider of commercialization support services to the biotechnology and
pharmaceutical industry, specifically providing reimbursement and patient access support services.
TheraCom’s capabilities complement those of the Lash Group and will significantly increase the size
and scope of consulting services being provided by our ABCS operating segment. TheraCom’s
annualized revenues are approximately $700 million, the majority of which are provided by the
specialized distribution component of the integrated reimbursement support services for certain
unique prescription products. Approximately $60 million of these revenues were from sales to
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, which will be eliminated in our future consolidated financial
statements.

Pharmaceutical Distribution

Our operations are comprised of one reportable segment, Pharmaceutical Distribution. The
Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment represents the consolidated operating results of the
Company and is comprised of four operating segments, which include the operations of
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (“ABDC”), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (“ABSG”),
AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (“ABCS”), and AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group (“ABPG”).
Servicing both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply
channel, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment’s operations provide drug distribution and related
services designed to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. Prior to fiscal 2011,
the business operations of ABCS were included within ABSG.

ABDC distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals,
over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services
to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems,
independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and
other alternate site pharmacies, and other customers. ABDC also provides pharmacy management,
staffing and other consulting services; scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment;
medication and supply dispensing cabinets; and supply management software to a variety of retail
and institutional healthcare providers.

ABSG, through a number of operating businesses, provides pharmaceutical distribution and other
services primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially
oncology, and to other healthcare providers, including dialysis clinics. ABSG also distributes
plasma and other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Additionally, ABSG
provides third party logistics and outcomes research, and other services for biotechnology and
other pharmaceutical manufacturers.

ABCS, through a number of operating businesses, provides commercialization support services
including reimbursement support programs, outcomes research, contract field staffing, patient
assistance and copay assistance programs, adherence programs, risk mitigation services, and other
market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers.



ABPG consists of American Health Packaging, Anderson Packaging (“Anderson”), and Brecon
Pharmaceuticals Limited (“Brecon”). American Health Packaging delivers unit dose, punch card,
unit-of-use, and other packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers.
American Health Packaging’s largest customer is ABDC and, as a result, its operations are closely
aligned with the operations of ABDC. Anderson and Brecon (based in the United Kingdom) are leading
providers of contract packaging and also provide clinical trials services for pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Beginning in fiscal 2012, to increase our operating efficiencies and to better align our
operations, each business unit within ABPG will be combined with ABDC or ABCS. More specifically,
the operations of American Health Packaging will be combined with the ABDC operating segment and
the operations of Anderson and Brecon will be combined with the ABCS operating segment.

Operating Results

Revenue of $80.2 billion in fiscal 2011 increased 2.9% from the prior fiscal year.
The increase in revenue was due to the 5% growth of ABDC, offset in part by the 3% revenue decline
of ABSG. During fiscal 2011, 71% of revenue was from sales to institutional customers and 29% was
from sales to retail customers; this compared to a customer mix in fiscal 2010 of 70% institutional
and 30% retail. Sales to institutional customers increased 4% in the current fiscal year and sales
to retail customers increased 1% in the current fiscal year.

ABDC’s revenue increased 5% from the prior fiscal year due to overall pharmaceutical market
growth and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers, primarily our institutional
customers.

ABSG’s revenue of $15.5 billion in fiscal 2011 decreased by 3% from the prior fiscal year
primarily due to the September 2010 discontinuance of its contract with a third party logistics
customer that transitioned to a direct manufacturer distribution model. ABSG’s revenue decline in
the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 was also attributable to a decline in sales to dialysis
providers, and a shift in product mix to more generic pharmaceuticals. The majority of ABSG’s revenue is generated from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to
physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology. ABSG’s business may
be adversely impacted in the future by changes in medical guidelines and the Medicare reimbursement
rates for certain pharmaceuticals, especially oncology drugs, administered by physicians and anemia
drugs. Since ABSG provides a number of services to or through physicians, any changes affecting
this service channel could result in slower growth or reduced revenues.



We currently expect our revenue growth in fiscal 2012 to be relatively flat or to grow
modestly in comparison to fiscal 2011. We expect a significant number of brand to generic drug
conversions in fiscal 2012 and one of our larger retail customers, the former Long’s Drugs, with
annual revenue totaling $2 billion, was previously acquired by a customer of one of our competitors
and did not renew its contract. As a result, we will no longer service this large customer after September 30,
2011. Our expected growth reflects U.S. pharmaceutical industry conditions, including increases in
prescription drug utilization, the introduction of new products, and higher branded pharmaceutical
prices, offset, in part, by the increased use of lower-priced generics. Our growth also may be
impacted, among other things, by industry competition and changes in customer mix. In July 2011,
our largest customer, Medco Health Solutions, Inc. (“Medco”), which accounted for 19% of our
revenue in fiscal 2011, announced its intention to merge with Express Scripts, Inc., which will be
the surviving corporation and is a customer of one of our competitors. Our business with Medco
contributes approximately 5% of our earnings. Our current contract with Medco continues at least
through March 2013. We will make every effort to extend our relationship with the combined entity
upon the expiration of our current contract; however, if we fail to do so, our revenue, earnings
and cash flows would be significantly impacted. Our future revenue growth will continue to be
affected by various factors such as industry growth trends, including the likely increase in the
number of generic drugs that will be available over the next few years as a result of the
expiration of certain drug patents held by brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers, general
economic conditions in the United States, competition within the industry, customer consolidation,
changes in pharmaceutical manufacturer pricing and distribution policies and practices, increased
downward pressure on government and other third party reimbursement rates to our customers, and
changes in Federal government rules and regulations.

Gross profit of $2.5 billion in fiscal 2011 increased $182.5 million or 7.7% from the prior
fiscal year. The increase was greater than our revenue growth in large part due to the specialty
generic product introductions (launches), the continued strong growth and profitability of our
non-specialty generic programs and increased contributions from our fee-for-service agreements with
pharmaceutical manufacturers. All of the above was offset in part by normal competitive pressures
on customer margins. Oxaliplatin, Gemcitabine, and Docetaxel (all generic oncology drugs), were
launched in the quarters ended September 30, 2009, December 31, 2010, and March 31, 2011,
respectively. The gross profit benefit achieved collectively from all three generic oncology drugs
in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2011 was higher than the benefit achieved from Oxaliplatin
alone in the prior fiscal year by approximately $96 million. Sales of Oxaliplatin, the largest
contributor of the three specialty generic drugs, benefited our gross
profit by approximately $106
million and $117 million in the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We
fully depleted our inventory of this product in fiscal 2011. Further quantities of Oxaliplatin are
not expected to be available until the product is re-launched in August 2012. Beginning in our
fourth quarter ended September 30, 2011, the gross profit contributions from sales of Gemcitabine
and Docetaxel began to moderate as additional pharmaceutical manufacturers offered these products
for sale and as third party reimbursement rates to our customers declined. Additionally, we expect
the gross profit contributions from the sales of Gemcitabine and Docetaxel to be significantly
lower in fiscal 2012 in comparison to fiscal 2011. In fiscal 2012, we
expect the gross profit decline from the above-mentioned three
specialty generic products will be substantially offset by the
expected gross profit contribution from the over 30 ABDC brand to
generic product conversions that are anticipated to occur. However,
there are unique circumstances surrounding the launch of each generic
product and the actual gross profit from these launches can differ
materially from what we expect. In the current fiscal year, we recognized a gain of $2.1 million
from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. This compared to a
recognized gain of $20.7 million from antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical
manufacturers in the prior fiscal year. These gains were recorded as reductions to cost of goods
sold. We are unable to estimate future gains, if any, that we will recognize as a result of antitrust
settlements (see Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Lastly, in fiscal
2010, we completed a reconciliation with one of our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives
owed to us. Our gross profit benefited by approximately $12 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of
having completed this reconciliation.

As a percentage of revenue, our gross profit margin of 3.17% in fiscal 2011 improved 15 basis
points from the prior fiscal year. The gross profit margin
improvement was due to the above-mentioned generic oncology drug launches, the strong growth and profitability of our non-specialty
generic programs and increased contributions from our fee-for-service agreements with
pharmaceutical manufacturers. These factors more than offset the above market growth of some of
our largest customers, who benefit from our best pricing, and normal competitive pressures on
customer margins. Additionally, the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, as noted above,
contributed 2 basis points to our gross profit margin in fiscal 2010.

Our cost of goods sold includes a last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) provision that is affected by
changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be
impacted by market and other external influences. We recorded a LIFO charge of $34.7 million and
$30.2 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.

In fiscal 2011, we started to incur significant costs to support our new ERP system as we
began the transition of our legacy information systems to our new ERP system. The incremental
costs of maintaining dual information technology platforms, including depreciation, are estimated
to be $40 million per year during the transition period. Additionally, in fiscal 2011, ABDC
implemented its Energiz program, which encompasses a number of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity,
improve customer contractual compliance, and drive efficiency by linking our information technology
capabilities more effectively with our operations.



Operating expenses of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2011 increased $83.3 million or 6.7% from the
prior fiscal year primarily due to the incremental costs of maintaining dual information technology
platforms (including depreciation), an increase in consulting expenses related to ABDC’s Energiz
program, and an increase in employee severance, litigation and other costs. In fiscal 2011, we
incurred severance costs of $4.4 million related to our Energiz program, we recorded a $16.0
million charge related to the preliminary Qui Tam settlement (the Qui Tam Matter as described in
Note 12 “Legal Matters and Contingencies” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements),
we incurred $3.2 million of costs related to business acquisitions, and we incurred a $6.5 million
charge related to intangible asset impairments. In the prior fiscal year, asset impairment charges
included a write-off of capitalized software of $6.7 million (included within distribution, selling
and administrative expenses) and intangible asset impairment charges of $3.2 million.
Additionally, the prior fiscal year benefited from the reversal of a $4.4 million legal accrual.
As a percentage of revenue, operating expenses were 1.67% in fiscal 2011, and increased by 6 basis
points from the prior fiscal year due to the same matters as noted above and was offset, in part,
by our operating leverage, particularly within ABDC.

Operating income of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2011 increased $99.1 million or 9.0% from the prior
fiscal year due to the increase in our gross profit. As a percentage of revenue, operating income
increased 8 basis points to 1.50% in fiscal 2011 due to the increase in our gross profit margin,
offset in part by the increase in our operating expense margin.

The net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, the costs relating to employee
severance, litigation and other, and the asset impairments decreased operating income as a
percentage of revenue by 3 basis points in fiscal 2011 and increased operating income as a
percentage of revenue by 2 basis points in fiscal 2010.

Other income of $4.6 million in fiscal 2011 primarily related to a gain resulting from
payments received in excess of amounts accrued on a note receivable relating to a prior business
disposition. Other loss of $3.4 million in fiscal 2010 primarily related to a loss incurred on an
equity investment.

Interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase in the
weighted average interest rate and a decline in interest costs capitalized relating to our Business
Transformation project. Interest costs capitalized have the effect of reducing interest expense
and were $3.4 million and $6.6 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Interest income
decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in
the weighted average interest
rate and an increase in the amount of cash held in non-interest bearing cash accounts.

Our interest expense in future periods may vary significantly depending upon changes in net
borrowings, interest rates, amendments to our current borrowing facilities, and strategic decisions
to deploy our invested cash. We expect our interest expense to be significantly higher in fiscal
2012 primarily due to the November 2011 issuance of our 3


/


% senior notes due 2021, as described
further within Liquidity and Capital Resources.

Income taxes in fiscal 2011 reflect an effective tax rate of 37.5%, compared to 38.0% in the
prior fiscal year. The decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to
adjustments made relating to state deferred income taxes. We continue to expect that our ongoing
effective tax rate will be approximately 38.4%.



Net income of $706.6 million in fiscal 2011 increased 11.0% from the prior fiscal year
primarily due to the increase in operating income. Diluted earnings per share of $2.54 in fiscal
2011 increased 14.4% from $2.22 in the prior fiscal year. The difference between diluted earnings
per share growth and the increase in net income was primarily due to the 3% reduction in weighted
average common shares outstanding, primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with
our stock repurchase programs (as described within Liquidity and Capital Resources), net of the
impact of stock option exercises.

Year ended September 30, 2010 compared with Year ended September 30, 2009

Operating Results

Revenue of $78.0 billion in fiscal 2010, which included bulk deliveries to customer
warehouses, increased 8.6% from the prior fiscal year. The increase in revenue was due to the 10%
growth of ABDC and the 5% growth of ABSG. During fiscal 2010, 70% of revenue was from sales to
institutional customers and 30% was sales to retail customers; this compared to a customer mix in
fiscal 2009 of 69% institutional and 31% retail. Sales to institutional customers increased 10% in
the current fiscal year and sales to retail customers increased 6% in the current fiscal year.

ABDC’s revenue in fiscal 2010 increased by 10% from the prior fiscal year due to overall
pharmaceutical market growth; revenue from our new customers, primarily new buying group customers
with which we started doing business in March and April of 2009 and a new alternate site customer
which we added in August 2009 (collectively representing approximately 4% of ABDC’s revenue growth
in fiscal 2010); and the above market growth of a few of our largest customers.

ABSG’s revenue in fiscal 2010 of $16.0 billion increased 5% from the prior fiscal year due to
growth of its distribution businesses, primarily relating to the distribution of nephrology and
blood products and its third party logistics business. The majority of ABSG’s revenue is generated
from the distribution of pharmaceuticals to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease
states, especially oncology.

Gross profit of $2.4 billion in fiscal 2010 increased by $256.6 million or 12% from the prior
fiscal year. This increase was in large part attributable to our revenue growth, the continued
strong growth and profitability of our generic programs (with generic revenue increasing by 17% in
comparison to the prior fiscal year) and increased contributions from fee-for-service agreements
with brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers. In August 2009, a generic oncology drug,
Oxaliplatin, was introduced (launched) and ABSG’s gross profit significantly benefited from this
generic launch in fiscal 2010. The gross profit benefit that we received from this generic launch
significantly exceeded the typical benefit we have experienced in the past from generic launches.
Approximately one-third of the gross profit increase for fiscal 2010 was derived from this new
generic product launch. Additionally, in fiscal 2010, we recognized a gain of $20.7 million from
antitrust litigation settlements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. This gain was recorded as a
reduction to cost of goods sold. Lastly, in fiscal 2010, we completed a reconciliation with one of
our generic suppliers relating to rebate incentives owed to us. Our gross profit benefited by
approximately $12 million in fiscal 2010 as a result of having completed this reconciliation.

As a percentage of revenue, our gross profit margin of 3.02% in fiscal 2010 improved by 9
basis points from the prior fiscal year due to the strong growth and profitability of our generic
programs, including new and recent generic launches, and increased contributions from
fee-for-service agreements with brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers. Additionally, the gain on
antitrust litigation settlements, as noted above, had the effect of increasing our gross profit
margin by 2 basis points in fiscal 2010. All of these factors more than offset the above market
growth of some of our largest customers, who benefit from our best pricing, and normal competitive
pressures on customer margins.

We recorded a LIFO charge of $30.2 million and $15.1 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009,
respectively. The increase in our LIFO charge reflects strong brand-name price inflation and a
year-over-year reduction in generic price deflation.



Operating expenses of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2010 increased by $36.7 million or 3% from the
prior fiscal year due to an increase in bad debt expense of $11.3 million primarily relating to
physician customers within ABSG’s oncology business, an increase in incentive compensation, an
increase in depreciation and amortization of $7.6 million, and additional expenses incurred
relating to our Business Transformation project, which includes a new enterprise resource planning
(“ERP”) system. The above increases were offset, in part, by a $9.9 million reduction in employee
severance, litigation and other costs and a $4.7 million reduction in asset impairment charges.
Asset impairment charges in the current fiscal year included a write-off of capitalized software of
$6.7 million (included within distribution, selling and administrative expenses) and intangible asset
impairment charges of $3.2 million. Asset impairment charges in the prior fiscal year included
intangible asset impairment charges of $11.8 million and the write-off of capitalized software of
$2.8 million (included within distribution, selling and administrative expenses). As a percentage
of revenue, operating expenses were 1.61% in fiscal 2010 and represented a significant 8 basis
point decline in our operating expense ratio from the prior fiscal year, reflecting our strong
operating leverage particularly within ABDC as its operating expenses remained relatively flat in
fiscal 2010 in comparison to the prior fiscal year, despite its 10% revenue growth. Our operating
leverage has benefited from significant productivity increases achieved from our highly automated
distribution facilities and our cE2 initiative, as described below.

In July 2010 and October 2010, we implemented the first and second phases of our new ERP
system. As a result, we started to depreciate a significant portion of our capitalized project
costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. Additionally, we started to incur other significant
costs to support our new ERP system as we began the transition from our legacy information systems
to our ERP system.

In fiscal 2008, we announced a more streamlined organizational structure and introduced an
initiative (“cE2”) designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost effectiveness. In
connection with these efforts, we reduced various operating costs and terminated certain positions.
In fiscal 2009, we terminated 197 employees and incurred $3.1 million of employee severance costs
relating to our cE2 initiative. Additionally, in fiscal 2009, we recorded $2.2 million of expense
to increase our liability relating to a former executive employee matter. In fiscal 2010, we
reversed our remaining $4.4 million liability relating to this matter.

Operating income of $1.1 billion in fiscal 2010 increased $219.9 million or 25% from the prior
fiscal year due to the increase in our gross profit. As a percentage of revenue, operating income
increased 19 basis points to 1.42% in fiscal 2010 due to the increase in our gross profit margin
and the decrease in our operating expense ratio.

The net impact of the gain on antitrust litigation settlements, the benefit from employee
severance, litigation and other, and the intangible asset impairments increased operating income as
a percentage of revenue by 3 basis points in fiscal 2010. The costs of employee severance,
litigation and other, and the intangible asset impairments decreased operating income as a
percentage of revenue by 2 basis points in fiscal 2009.

Interest expense increased from the prior fiscal year due to an increase of $183.2 million in
average borrowings, offset in part, by an increase in interest costs capitalized relating to our
Business Transformation project and a decrease in the weighted average variable interest rate on
borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to 1.71% from 2.08% in the prior fiscal year.
Interest costs capitalized in fiscal 2010 and 2009 were $6.6 million and $2.9 million,
respectively. Interest income decreased from the prior fiscal year primarily due to a decrease in
the weighted average interest rate, offset in part, by an increase in average invested cash of
$578.3 million.

Average borrowings increased in fiscal 2010 resulting from the November 2009 issuance of $400
million of ten-year senior notes, offset in part, by the repayment of substantially all amounts
then outstanding under our multi-currency revolving credit facility (both described in Liquidity
and Capital Resources).



Income taxes in fiscal 2010 reflect an effective income tax rate of 38.0%, compared to 37.9%
in the prior fiscal year. Due to the impact of discrete tax events, we were able to recognize
certain federal and state tax benefits in fiscal 2010 and 2009, thereby reducing our effective tax
rate from a normalized 38.4%.

Income from continuing operations of $636.7 million in fiscal 2010 increased 24% from $511.9
million in the prior fiscal year primarily due to the increase in operating income. Diluted
earnings per share from continuing operations of $2.22 in fiscal 2010 increased 31% from $1.69 per
share in the prior fiscal year. The difference between diluted earnings per share growth and the
increase in income from continuing operations was primarily due to the 5% reduction in weighted
average common shares outstanding, primarily from purchases of our common stock in connection with
our stock repurchase program (see Liquidity and Capital Resources), net of the impact of stock
option exercises.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Critical accounting policies are those policies which involve accounting estimates and
assumptions that can have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations and
require the use of complex and subjective estimates based upon past experience and management’s
judgment. Actual results may differ from these estimates due to uncertainties inherent in such
estimates. Below are those policies applied in preparing our financial statements that management
believes are the most dependent on the application of estimates and assumptions. For a complete
list of significant accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Trade receivables are primarily comprised of amounts owed to us for our pharmaceutical
distribution and services activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts
and a reserve for customer sales returns. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful
accounts, we consider a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry
trends, and our customers’ financial strength, credit standing, and payment and default history.
Changes in the aforementioned factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in our allowance for
doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by our management
as to the impact of these and other factors on the ultimate realization of our trade receivables.
Each of our business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial
condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on historical experience and
for specific credit problems when they arise. We write off balances against the reserves when
collectability is deemed remote. Each business unit performs formal documented reviews of the
allowance at least quarterly and our largest business units perform such reviews monthly. There
were no significant changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010,
and 2009 and bad debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. The bad
debt expense for any period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for
doubtful accounts, net of write-offs, recoveries and other adjustments. Schedule II of this Form
10-K sets forth a rollforward of the allowance for doubtful accounts.

Bad debt expense for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009 was $39.3
million, $43.1 million, and $31.8 million respectively. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2011
allowance as a percentage of trade receivables would result in an increase or decrease in the
provision on accounts receivable of approximately $3.9 million.

Supplier Reserves

We establish reserves against amounts due from our suppliers relating to various price and
rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due to them.
These reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of management after carefully
considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical experience with the suppliers, the
specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information available to us. We evaluate the
amounts due from our suppliers on a continual basis and adjust the reserve estimates when
appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances. An increase or decrease of 0.1% in the 2011
supplier reserve balances as a percentage of trade payables would result in an increase or decrease
in cost of goods sold by approximately $9.2 million. The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim
may be different from our estimate.



Loss Contingencies

An estimated loss contingency is accrued in our consolidated financial statements if it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. We
regularly review loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of our accruals and related
disclosures. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates.

Merchandise Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 80% and 78% of
our inventories at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, has been determined using the
last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method. If we had used the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method of
inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been
approximately $256.0 million and $221.3 million higher than the amounts reported at September 30,
2011 and 2010, respectively. We recorded a LIFO charge of $34.7 million, $30.2 million, and $15.1
million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 respectively.

Business Combinations

The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values,
with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. We engage third party appraisal firms
to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities
assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant judgments, estimates and
assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management makes estimates of fair value
based upon assumptions it believes to be reasonable. These estimates are based on historical
experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies, and are
inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but
are not limited to: future expected cash flows from and economic lives of customer relationships,
trade names, existing technology, and other intangible assets; and discount rates. Unanticipated
events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions,
estimates or actual events.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired entity over the net amounts
assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill and intangible assets with
indefinite lives are not amortized; rather, they are tested for impairment on at least an annual
basis. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships, non-compete
agreements, patents and software technology, are amortized over their estimated useful lives.

In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, a determination of the
fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required and is
based, among other things, on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting unit
and/or the component of the entity being valued. We are required to complete an impairment test for
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting impairment losses at
least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in circumstances
indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value (“impairment indicators”). This impairment
test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows, analysis of our market capitalization
and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets and liabilities. Estimating
future cash flows and determining their present values are based upon, among other things, certain
assumptions about expected future operating performance and appropriate discount rates determined
by management.

We completed our required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other intangible
assets with indefinite lives in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, and, as a
result, recorded $6.5 million, $2.5 million, and $1.6 million of impairment charges, respectively.
In fiscal 2009, due to the existence of impairment indicators at U.S. Bioservices, a specialty
pharmacy company within our Specialty Group, we performed an impairment test on the pharmacy’s
trade name as of June 30, 2009, which resulted in an impairment charge of $8.9 million. Our
estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to, among other things, economic
conditions, changes to the business model, or changes in operating performance. Significant
differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future
financial results.

Share-Based Compensation

We utilize a binomial option pricing model to determine the fair value of share-based
compensation expense, which involves the use of several assumptions, including expected term of the
option, future volatility, dividend yield and forfeiture rate. The expected term of options
represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding and is based
on historical experience. Expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock
as well as other factors, such as implied volatility.



Income Taxes

Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and uncertain tax positions
reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the financial
statements. Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between financial reporting and
tax reporting bases of assets and liabilities, as well as net operating loss and tax credit
carryforwards for tax purposes.

We have established a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets for which the
ultimate realization of future benefits is uncertain. Expiring carryforwards and the required
valuation allowances are adjusted annually. After application of the valuation allowances described
above, we anticipate that no limitations will apply with respect to utilization of any of the other
deferred income tax assets described above.

We prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and
record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations. In the normal course of business,
our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities. Such examinations may
result in future tax and interest assessments by these taxing authorities. Inherent uncertainties
exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation,
regulation and/or as concluded through the various jurisdictions’ tax court systems. We recognize
the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax
position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolutions of any
related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position.

We believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and the
amount of benefits recognized in our financial statements for uncertain tax positions are
appropriate based on current facts and circumstances. However, others applying reasonable judgment
to the same facts and circumstances could develop a different estimate and the amount ultimately
paid upon resolution of issues raised may differ from the amounts accrued.

The significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important
contributors to the ultimate effective tax rate in each year. If any of our assumptions or
estimates were to change, an increase or decrease in our effective tax rate by 1% on income before
income taxes would have caused income tax expense to change by $11.3 million in fiscal 2011.

In November 2011, we issued $500 million of 3


/


% senior notes due November 15, 2021 (the “2021
Notes”). The 2021 Notes were sold at 99.858% of the principal amount and have an effective yield
of 3.52%. Interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually, in arrears, commencing May 15, 2012.
The 2021 Notes rank pari passu to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility and the 2012 Notes,
the 2015 Notes, and the 2019 Notes (all defined below). We will use the net proceeds of the 2021
Notes for general corporate purposes. Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of the 2021
Notes will be deferred and amortized over the ten-year term of the notes.

We have a $700 million multi-currency senior unsecured revolving credit facility, which was
scheduled to expire in March 2015, (the “Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility”) with a
syndicate of lenders. In October 2011, we entered into an amendment with the syndicate of lenders
to extend the maturity date of the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility to October 2016. The
amendment also reduced our borrowing rates and facility fees. Interest on borrowings under the
Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at specified rates based on our debt rating and
ranges from 68 basis points to 155 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee,
as applicable (currently 90 basis points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee).
Additionally, interest on borrowings denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of
the Canadian prime rate or the CDOR rate. We pay facility fees to maintain
the availability under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on our
debt rating, ranging from 7 basis points to 20 basis points, annually, of the total commitment
(currently 10 basis points). We may choose to repay or reduce our commitments under the
Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility
contains covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others
that impose limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset
sales.

On October 31, 2011, we established a commercial paper program whereby we may from time to
time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $700 million at any one
time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid, and re-borrowed from time to
time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of
issuance. The notes will bear interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount
from their face amounts. The commercial paper program is fully backed by our Multi-Currency
Revolving Credit Facility.

We have a $700 million receivables securitization facility (“Receivables Securitization
Facility”), which was scheduled to expire in April 2014. In October 2011, we entered into an
amendment to the Receivables Securitization Facility to extend the maturity date to October 2014.
The amendment also reduced our borrowing rates. We have available to us an accordion feature
whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization Facility may be increased by up to $250
million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs during the December and March quarters.
Interest rates are currently based on prevailing market rates for short-term commercial paper or
LIBOR plus a program fee of 75 basis points. We currently pay an unused fee of 37.5 basis points,
annually, to maintain the availability under the Receivables Securitization Facility. At September
30, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Receivables Securitization Facility. The
Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the Multi-Currency Revolving
Credit Facility. In connection with the Receivables Securitization Facility, ABDC sells on a
revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables Financial Corporation, a
wholly owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage ownership interest in the
receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial institutions. ABDC is the servicer
of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization Facility. After the maximum limit
of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are collected, additional receivables
may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the facility. We use the facility as a
financing vehicle because it generally offers an attractive interest rate relative to other
financing sources.

In April 2011, we amended the $55 million Blanco revolving credit facility, (the “Blanco
Credit Facility”) to extend the maturity date to April 2012. Borrowings under the Blanco Credit
Facility are guaranteed by us. Interest on borrowings under this facility accrues at 100 basis
points over LIBOR. The Blanco Credit Facility is not classified in the current portion of long-term
debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011 because we have the ability and intent
to refinance it on a long-term basis.

We have $392.3 million of 5 5/8% senior notes due September 15, 2012 (the “2012 Notes”), $500
million of 5 7/8% senior notes due September 15, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”), and $400 million of 4
7/8% senior notes due November 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”). The 2012 Notes and 2015 Notes each
were sold at 99.5% of the principal amount and have an effective yield of 5.71% and 5.94%,
respectively. The 2019 Notes were sold in November 2009 at 99.174% of the principal amount and
have an effective yield of 4.98%. Interest on the 2012 Notes, the 2015 Notes, and the 2019 Notes
is payable semiannually in arrears. All of the senior notes rank pari passu to the Multi-Currency
Revolving Credit Facility.

Our operating results have generated cash flow, which, together with availability under our
debt agreements and credit terms from suppliers, has provided sufficient capital resources to
finance working capital and cash operating requirements, and to fund capital expenditures,
acquisitions, repayment of debt, the payment of interest on outstanding debt, dividends, and
repurchases of shares of our common stock.



Deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect the amount of
prescriptions that are filled and the amount of pharmaceutical products purchased by consumers and,
therefore, could reduce purchases by our customers. In addition, volatility in financial markets
may also negatively impact our customers’ ability to obtain credit to finance their businesses on
acceptable terms. Reduced purchases by our customers or changes in the ability of our customers to
remit payments to us could adversely affect our revenue growth, our profitability, and our cash
flow from operations.

Our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital, fund the payment of
interest on debt, fund repurchases of our common stock, fund the payment of dividends, finance
acquisitions and fund capital expenditures (including our Business Transformation project, which
involves the implementation of our new ERP system) and routine growth and expansion through new
business opportunities. In August 2011, our board of directors approved a new program allowing us
to purchase up to $750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market
conditions. In September 2010 and November 2009, our board of directors approved programs allowing
us to purchase up to $500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market
conditions. We purchased $848.1 million of our common stock in fiscal 2011, of which $98.1 million
was purchased to close out our November 2009 share repurchase program, $500.0 was purchased to
close out our September 2010 share repurchase program, and $250.0 million was purchased under the
August 2011 share repurchase program. As of September 30, 2011, we had $500.0 million of
availability remaining on the August 2011 share repurchase program. We currently expect to
purchase approximately $400.0 million of our common stock in fiscal 2012, subject to market
conditions. Future cash flows from operations and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund
our ongoing cash requirements.

Following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal and interest
payments on our debt, minimum rental payments on our noncancelable operating leases and minimum
payments on our other commitments at September 30, 2011 (in thousands):

The $55 million Blanco Credit Facility, which expires in April 2012, is included in the
“Within 1 year” column in the above table. However, this borrowing is not classified in the current
portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2011 because we have
the ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term basis.

We have commitments to purchase blood plasma products from suppliers through December 31,
2012. We are required to purchase quantities at prices that we believe will represent market
prices. We currently estimate our remaining purchase commitment under these agreements will be
approximately $121.2 million as of September 30, 2011, of which $95.7 million represents our
commitment in fiscal 2012. These commitments are included in “Other commitments” in the above
table.

We have outsourced to IBM Global Services (“IBM”) a significant portion of our corporate and
ABDC information technology activities including assistance with the implementation of our new
enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. The remaining commitment under our 10-year
arrangement, as amended, which expires in June 2015, is approximately $128.6 million as of
September 30, 2011, of which $39.4 million represents our commitment in fiscal 2012, and is
included in “Other commitments” in the above table.

Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $45.7 million (including interest and penalties)
as of September 30, 2011. This liability represents an estimate of tax positions that we have taken
in our tax returns which may ultimately not be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities.
Since the amount and timing of any future cash settlements cannot be predicted with reasonable
certainty, the estimated liability has been excluded from the above contractual obligations table.



During fiscal 2011, our operating activities provided $1,167.9 million of cash in comparison
to cash provided of $1,108.6 million in the prior fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating
activities in fiscal 2011 was principally the result of net income of $706.6 million, an increase
in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of $406.4 million, and non-cash items of
$394.0 million, offset, in part, by an increase in merchandise inventories of $272.3 million and an
increase in accounts receivable of $35.5 million. Non-cash items included the provision for
deferred income taxes of $195.0 million, which represents an increase of $109.5 million from the
prior fiscal year and is primarily attributable to income tax deductions associated with
merchandise inventories and tax bonus depreciation resulting from our Business Transformation
capital expenditures. Significant tax bonus depreciation is not expected to be available to us in our fiscal year ending September 30, 2012. Our inventory and accounts
payable balances at September 30, 2011 were 5% and 4% higher, respectively, than those balances at
September 30, 2010. These increases were largely attributable to the growth in our business in
fiscal 2011. The average number of inventory days on hand in fiscal 2011 decreased to 24.5 days
from 25.0 days in the prior fiscal year. The average number of days payable outstanding in fiscal
2011 decreased to 33.1 days from 33.6 days in the prior fiscal year. Despite the 3% increase in
revenue in fiscal 2011, accounts receivable at September 30, 2011 was relatively flat when compared
to the balance at September 30, 2010. This was primarily due to timing of customer payments to us.
Our average number of days sales outstanding during fiscal 2011 and 2010 was consistent at 17.3
days. Operating cash uses during fiscal 2011 included $74.2 million of interest payments and
$214.6 million of income tax payments, net of refunds.

During fiscal 2010, our operating activities provided $1,108.6 million of cash as compared to
cash provided of $783.8 million in the prior fiscal year. Net cash provided by operating
activities in fiscal 2010 was principally the result of net income of $636.7 million, non-cash
items of $280.0 million, an increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and income taxes of
$385.4 million, and a decrease in accounts receivable of $61.2 million, offset, in part, by an
increase in merchandise inventories of $243.0 million. Non-cash items included the provision for
deferred income taxes of $85.5 million, which primarily related to tax deductions associated with
merchandise inventories. Despite the 9% increase in revenue in fiscal 2010, accounts receivable at
September 30, 2010 decreased by 2% from September 30, 2009 as the average number of days sales
outstanding during fiscal 2010 decreased by nearly one day to 17.3 days from the prior fiscal year,
reflecting improved cash collection efforts, favorable customer mix, and timing of customer
receipts. Our inventory and accounts payable balances at September 30, 2010 were 5% higher and 4%
higher, respectively, than those balances at September 30, 2009. These increases were largely
attributed to the growth in our business in fiscal 2010. However, the increases were lower than
our revenue growth in fiscal 2010 because our inventory and accounts payable balances at September
30, 2009 were higher than normal as we made inventory purchases of approximately $400 million in
the month of September 2009, primarily relating to purchases of the generic oncology drug launched
in August 2009 and purchases made in advance of a manufacturer’s temporary plant shutdown in
connection with its facility consolidation efforts. The average number of inventory days on hand
in fiscal 2010 was consistent with the prior fiscal year. The number of average days payable
outstanding in fiscal 2010 increased to 33.6 days from 32.8 days in the prior fiscal year. This
increase was primarily due to timing of payments to our suppliers and a change in product mix to
more generic pharmaceuticals which generally have more favorable payment terms. Operating cash
uses during fiscal 2010 included $63.8 million in interest payments and $257.8 million of income
tax payments, net of refunds.

Capital expenditures in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $168.0 million, $184.6 million, and
$145.8 million, respectively. We currently expect to spend approximately $150 million for capital
expenditures during fiscal 2012. Our most significant capital expenditures in fiscal 2011, 2010
and 2009 related principally to our Business Transformation project, which includes a new ERP
system for our corporate office and for our ABDC operations. Other capital expenditures in fiscal
2011 included ABDC purchases of machinery and equipment, which were previously sold to financial
institutions and leased back by us, and other technology initiatives. Other capital expenditures
in fiscal 2010 included various enhancements made to our other business units’ information and
customer-related technology systems.

In September 2011, we acquired IntrinsiQ, LLC (“IntrinsiQ”), a leading provider of informatics
solutions that help community oncologists make treatment decisions for their patients, for a
purchase price of $34.3 million, net of a working capital adjustment. Additionally, in September
2011, we acquired Premier Source (“Premier”), a provider of consulting and reimbursement services
to medical device, pharmaceutical, molecular diagnostic, and biotechnology manufacturers, as well
as other health services companies, for a purchase price of $11.1 million, net of cash acquired.

In May 2009, we acquired Innomar, a Canadian specialty pharmaceutical services company, for a
purchase price of $13.4 million, net of a working capital adjustment.

In October 2008, we sold PMSI for approximately $31 million, net of a final working capital
adjustment. We received cash totaling $11.9 million and a $19 million subordinated note due from
PMSI on the fifth anniversary of the closing date. In October 2010, we received $4 million of the
total $19 million note due from PMSI as it achieved certain revenue targets with respect to its
largest customer.

Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2011 included net borrowings of $22.4 million
under our revolving and securitization credit facilities. Net cash used in financing activities in
fiscal 2010 included $396.7 million of proceeds received related to the November 2009 issuance of
our 2019 Notes and net repayments of $226.0 million under our revolving and securitization credit
facilities. Additionally, $7.7 million of discretionary long-term debt repayments were made in
fiscal 2010. Net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2009 included net repayments of $8.8
million under our revolving and securitization credit facilities.

During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we purchased a total of $840.6 million, $470.4 million,
and $450.4 million, respectively, of our common stock in connection with our share repurchase
programs, which are summarized below.



In November 2008, our board of directors authorized a program allowing the purchase of up to
$500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal
2009, we purchased $431.9 million under this program and during fiscal 2010, we purchased $68.1
million to complete the program.

In November 2009, our board of directors authorized a program allowing us to purchase up to
$500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During fiscal
2010, we purchased $401.9 million under this program and during fiscal 2011, we purchased $98.1
million to complete the program.

In September 2010, our board of directors authorized a program allowing us to purchase up to
$500 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions, all of which
was purchased during fiscal 2011.

In August 2011, our board of directors authorized a new program allowing us to purchase up to
$750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock, subject to market conditions. During
fiscal 2011, we purchased $250.0 million under this program, of which $8.0 million was cash-settled
in October 2011.

In November 2008, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 33% to $0.05 per
share. During the first three quarters of fiscal 2009, we paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.05
per share. In May 2009, our board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend by 20% to
$0.06 per share and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we paid a quarterly cash dividend of
$0.06 per share. In November 2009, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 33%
from $0.06 per share to $0.08 per share. During fiscal 2010, we paid quarterly cash dividends of
$0.08 per share. In November 2010, our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend by 25%
from $0.08 per share to $0.10 per share. In May 2011, our board of directors increased the
quarterly cash dividend by 15% from $0.10 per share to $0.115 per share. In November 2011, our
board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend again by 13% from $0.115 per share to
$0.13 per share. We anticipate that we will continue to pay quarterly cash dividends in the
future. However, the payment and amount of future dividends remain within the discretion of our
board of directors and will depend upon our future earnings, financial condition, capital
requirements and other factors.

Market Risk

Our most significant market risk historically has been the effect of fluctuations in interest
rates relating to our debt. We manage interest rate risk by using a combination of fixed-rate and
variable-rate debt. At September 30, 2011, we had $76.9 million of variable rate debt outstanding.
The amount of variable-rate debt fluctuates during the year based on our working capital
requirements. We periodically evaluate financial instruments to manage our exposure to fixed and
variable interest rates. However, there are no assurances that such instruments will be available
in the combinations we want and on terms acceptable to us. There were no such financial
instruments in effect at September 30, 2011.

We also have market risk exposure to interest rate fluctuations relating to our cash and cash
equivalents. We had $1.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2011. The
unfavorable impact of a hypothetical decrease in interest rates on cash and cash equivalents would
be partially offset by the favorable impact of such a decrease on variable-rate debt. For every
$100 million of cash invested that is in excess of variable-rate debt, a 10 basis point decrease in
interest rates would increase our annual net interest expense by $0.1 million.

We are exposed to foreign currency and exchange rate risk from our non-U.S. operations. Our
largest exposure to foreign exchange rates exists primarily with the Canadian Dollar. We may
utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge against changes in foreign exchange
rates. Such contracts generally have durations of less than one year. We had no foreign currency
denominated forward contracts at September 30, 2011. We may use derivative instruments to hedge our
foreign currency exposure but not for speculative or trading purposes.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Effective October 1, 2009, we adopted the applicable sections of Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 805, “Business Combinations,” which provides revised guidance for recognizing
and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
non-controlling interest in the acquired business. Additionally, this ASC provides disclosure
requirements to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects
of the business combination. We also adopted certain other applicable sections that address
application issues raised on the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and
accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities relating to contingencies from a business
combination. We expensed acquisition related costs of $3.2 million in the fourth quarter ended
September 30, 2011 relating to our completed or pending business combinations.



In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-05, “Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income.” ASU No.
2011-05 requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive
income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate, but
consecutive statements. ASU No. 2011-05 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011, and early adoption is permitted. We are
evaluating our presentation options under ASU No. 2011-05; however, we do not expect adoption of
this guidance to impact our consolidated financial statements other than the change in
presentation.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic
350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.” Under ASU No. 2011-08, an entity has the option to first
assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a
determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount. If the entity determines that this threshold is not met, then performing the
two-step impairment test is unnecessary. ASU No. 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years that begin
after December 15, 2011, and early adoption is permitted. We intend to early adopt this ASU in our
fiscal year ending September 30, 2012.

Forward-Looking Statements

Certain of the statements contained in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and elsewhere in this report are “forward-looking
statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are based on management’s current expectations
and are subject to uncertainty and change in circumstances. Among the factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated or implied are the following:
changes in pharmaceutical market growth rates; the loss of one or more key customer or supplier
relationships; changes in customer mix; customer delinquencies, defaults or insolvencies; supplier
defaults or insolvencies; changes in pharmaceutical manufacturers’ pricing and distribution
policies or practices; adverse resolution of any contract or other dispute with customers or
suppliers; federal and state government enforcement initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious
orders of controlled substances and the diversion of controlled substances; qui tam litigation for
alleged violations of fraud and abuse laws and regulations and/or other laws and regulations
governing the marketing, sale and purchase of pharmaceutical products or any related litigation,
including shareholder derivative lawsuits; changes in federal and state legislation or regulatory
action affecting pharmaceutical product pricing or reimbursement policies, including under Medicaid
and Medicare; changes in regulatory or clinical medical guidelines and/or labeling for the
pharmaceutical products we distribute, including certain anemia products; price inflation in
branded pharmaceuticals and price deflation in generics; greater or less than anticipated benefit
from launches of the generic versions of previously patented pharmaceutical products; significant
breakdown or interruption of our information technology systems; our inability to implement an
enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to handle business and financial processes and
transactions (including processes and transactions relating to our customers and suppliers) of
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation operations and our corporate operations without functional
problems, unanticipated delays and/or cost overruns; success of integration, restructuring or
systems initiatives; interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; economic,
business, competitive and/or regulatory developments in Canada, the United Kingdom and elsewhere
outside of the United States, including potential changes in Canadian provincial legislation
affecting pharmaceutical product pricing or service fees or regulatory action by provincial
authorities in Canada to lower pharmaceutical product pricing and service fees; the impact of
divestitures or the acquisition of businesses that do not perform as we expect or that are
difficult for us to integrate or control; our inability to successfully complete any other
transaction that we may wish to pursue from time to time; changes in tax laws or legislative
initiatives that could adversely affect our tax positions and/or our tax liabilities or adverse
resolution of challenges to our tax positions; increased costs of maintaining, or reductions in our
ability to maintain, adequate liquidity and financing sources; volatility and deterioration of the
capital and credit markets; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory
and/or operational factors affecting our business generally. Certain additional factors that
management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those
described in forward-looking statements are set forth elsewhere in this MD&A, in Item 1A (Risk
Factors), Item 1 (Business) and elsewhere in this report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of AmerisourceBergen Corporation

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of AmerisourceBergen Corporation
and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September 30, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed
in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and
schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of AmerisourceBergen Corporation and subsidiaries at
September 30, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended September 30, 2011, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), internal control over financial reporting of AmerisourceBergen
Corporation and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal
Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated November 22, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

AMERISOURCEBERGEN CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

September 30, 2011

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

AmerisourceBergen Corporation (the “Company”) is a pharmaceutical services company providing
drug distribution and related healthcare services and solutions to its pharmacy, physician and
manufacturer customers, which are based primarily in the United States and Canada.

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
wholly-owned subsidiaries as of the dates and for the fiscal years indicated. All intercompany
accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual amounts could differ
from these estimated amounts due to uncertainties inherent in such estimates. Management
periodically evaluates estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements for continued
reasonableness.

In October 2008, the Company completed the sale of its workers’ compensation business, PMSI
(see Note 3). The Company classified PMSI’s operating results as discontinued in the consolidated
financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009, as PMSI was eliminated from the
ongoing operations of the Company upon its divestiture.

Certain
reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts in order to conform to the
current year presentation.

Business Combinations

The purchase price of an acquired company is allocated between tangible and intangible assets
acquired and liabilities assumed from the acquired business based on their estimated fair values,
with the residual of the purchase price recorded as goodwill. The results of operations of the
acquired businesses are included in the Company’s operating results from the dates of acquisition
(see Note 2).

Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months
or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value.

Concentrations of Credit Risk and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company sells its merchandise inventories to a large number of customers in the healthcare
industry that include institutional and retail healthcare providers. Institutional healthcare
providers include acute care hospitals, health systems, mail order pharmacies, long-term care and
other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities, and
physician offices. Retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore
chains, independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass
merchandisers. The financial condition of the Company’s customers can be affected by changes in
government reimbursement policies as well as by other economic pressures in the healthcare
industry.

The Company’s trade accounts receivable are exposed to credit risk, but the risk is moderated
because the Company’s customer base is diverse and geographically widespread primarily within the
U.S. and Canada. The Company generally does not require collateral for trade receivables. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and maintains an
allowance for doubtful accounts. In determining the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts,
the Company considers a combination of factors, such as the aging of trade receivables, industry
trends, its customers’ financial strength, credit standing, and payment and default history.
Changes in these factors, among others, may lead to adjustments in the Company’s allowance for
doubtful accounts. The calculation of the required allowance requires judgment by Company
management as to the impact of those and other factors on the ultimate realization of its trade
receivables. Each of the Company’s business units performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers’ financial condition and maintains reserves for probable bad debt losses based on
historical experience and for specific credit problems when they arise. There were no significant
changes to this process during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009 and bad
debt expense was computed in a consistent manner during these periods. The bad debt expense for any
period presented is equal to the changes in the period end allowance for doubtful accounts, net of
write-offs,
recoveries and other adjustments. Schedule II of this Form 10-K sets forth a rollforward of
the allowance for doubtful accounts. At September 30, 2011, the largest trade receivable due from a
single customer represented approximately 11% of accounts receivable, net. In fiscal 2011, Medco
Health Solutions, Inc. (“Medco”), our largest customer, accounted for 19% of our revenue. The
Company’s next largest customer accounted for 5.5% of its fiscal 2011 revenue.



The Company maintains cash and cash equivalents with several financial institutions. Deposits
held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. These deposits may be
redeemed upon demand, and are maintained with financial institutions with reputable credit, and,
therefore, bear minimal credit risk. The Company seeks to mitigate such risks by monitoring the
risk profiles of these counterparties. The Company also seeks to mitigate risk by monitoring the
investment strategy of money market accounts that it is invested in, which are classified as cash
equivalents.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company records all derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet at fair value
and complies with established criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships.

As of September 30, 2011 and 2010, there were no outstanding derivative financial instruments.
The Company’s policy prohibits it from entering into derivative financial instruments for
speculative or trading purposes.

Equity Investments

The Company uses the equity method of accounting for its investments in entities in which it
has significant influence; generally, this represents an ownership interest of between 20% and 50%.
The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities in which the Company does not have
significant influence are classified as “available for sale” and are carried at fair value within
the Other Assets line item on the consolidated balance sheet, with unrealized gains and losses
excluded from earnings and reported in the accumulated other comprehensive loss component of
stockholders’ equity. Unrealized losses that are determined to be other-than-temporary impairment
losses are recorded as a component of earnings in the period in which that determination is made.

Foreign Currency

The functional currency of the Company’s foreign operations is the applicable local currency.
Assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the current exchange rates in effect
at the balance sheet date, while revenues and expenses are translated
at the weighted average
exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess purchase price of an acquired entity over the net amounts
assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company does not amortize purchased
goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives; rather, they are tested for impairment on at
least an annual basis. Intangible assets with finite lives, primarily customer relationships,
non-compete agreements, patents and software technology, are amortized over their estimated useful
lives, which range from 2 to 15 years.

The Company’s operating segments are comprised of AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation,
AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services, and AmerisourceBergen
Packaging Group. Each operating segment has an executive who is responsible for managing the
segment and reporting directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, the
Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”). Each operating segment is comprised of a number
of operating units (components), for which discrete financial information is available. These
components are aggregated into reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment testing.

In order to test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, a determination of the
fair value of the Company’s reporting units and intangible assets with indefinite lives is required
and is based, among other things, on estimates of future operating performance of the reporting
unit and/or the component of the entity being valued. The Company is required to complete an
impairment test for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and record any resulting
impairment losses at least on an annual basis or more often if warranted by events or changes in
circumstances indicating that the carrying value may exceed fair value (“impairment indicators”).
This impairment test includes the projection and discounting of cash flows, analysis of the
Company’s market capitalization and estimating the fair values of tangible and intangible assets
and liabilities. Estimates of future cash flows and determination of their present values are based
upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and
appropriate discount rates determined by management.



The Company completed its required annual impairment tests relating to goodwill and other
intangible assets in the three months ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009, and, as a result,
recorded $6.5 million, $2.5 million, and $1.6 million of impairment charges, respectively.
Additionally, in fiscal 2009, due to the existence of impairment indicators at U.S. Bioservices, a
specialty pharmacy company within AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, the Company performed an
impairment test on the pharmacy’s trade name as of June 30, 2009, which resulted in an impairment
charge of $8.9 million. The Company’s estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows
due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to the business model, or changes in
operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could
materially affect the Company’s future financial results.

Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes using a method that requires recognition of deferred tax
assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently
exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of the Company’s assets and liabilities
(commonly known as the asset and liability method). In assessing the ability to realize deferred
tax assets, the Company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of
the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more
likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities,
including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits
of the position.

Loss Contingencies

The Company accrues for estimated loss contingencies related to litigation if it is probable
that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Assessing contingencies is highly subjective and requires judgments about future events. The
Company regularly reviews loss contingencies to determine the adequacy of its accruals and related
disclosures. The amount of the actual loss may differ significantly from these estimates.

Manufacturer Incentives

The Company accounts for fees and other incentives received from its suppliers, relating to
the purchase or distribution of inventory, as a reduction to cost of goods sold. The Company
considers these fees and other incentives to represent product discounts, and as a result, they are
capitalized as product costs and relieved through cost of goods sold upon the sale of the related
inventory.

Merchandise Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost for approximately 80% and 78% of
the Company’s inventories at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, has been determined using
the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. If the Company had used the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method
of inventory valuation, which approximates current replacement cost, inventories would have been
approximately $256.0 million and $221.3 million higher than the amounts reported at September 30,
2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company recorded a LIFO charge of $34.7 million, $30.2 million,
and $15.1 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over
the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from 3 to 40 years for buildings and
improvements and from 3 to 10 years for machinery, equipment and other. The costs of repairs and
maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.

The Company capitalizes project costs relating to computer software developed or obtained for
internal use when the activities related to the project reach the application development stage.
Costs that are associated with preliminary stage activities, training, maintenance, and all other
post-implementation stage activites are expensed as they are incurred. Software development costs
are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives, which range from 5
to 10 years.

In connection with the Company’s Business Transformation project, which includes a new
enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system, the Company wrote-off capitalized software costs
totaling $6.7 million and $2.8 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively.



Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, product has
been delivered or services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. Revenue as reflected in the accompanying consolidated
statements of operations is net of estimated sales returns and allowances.

The Company’s customer sales return policy generally allows customers to return products only
if the products can be resold at full value or returned to suppliers for full credit. The Company
records an accrual for estimated customer sales returns at the time of sale to the customer. At
September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company’s accrual for estimated customer sales returns was $258.3
million and $270.1 million, respectively.

The Company reports the gross dollar amount of bulk deliveries to customer warehouses in
revenue and the related costs in cost of goods sold. Bulk delivery transactions are arranged by the
Company at the express direction of the customer, and involve either drop shipments from the
supplier directly to customers’ warehouse sites or cross-dock shipments from the supplier to the
Company for immediate shipment to the customers’ warehouse sites. The Company is a principal to
these transactions because it is the primary obligor and has the ultimate and contractual
responsibility for fulfillment and acceptability of the products purchased, and bears full risk of
delivery and loss for products, whether the products are drop-shipped or shipped via cross-dock.
The Company also bears full credit risk associated with the creditworthiness of any bulk delivery
customer. As a result, the Company records bulk deliveries to customer warehouses as gross
revenues. Gross profit earned by the Company on bulk deliveries was not material in any year
presented.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for the compensation cost of all share-based payments at fair value and
reports the related expense within distribution, selling and administrative expenses to correspond
with the same line item as the cash compensation paid to employees. The benefits of tax deductions
in excess of recognized compensation expense are reported as a financing cash flow ($39.7 million,
$21.0 million, and $1.5 million for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009
respectively).

Shipping and Handling Costs

Shipping and handling costs include all costs to warehouse, pick, pack and deliver inventory
to customers. These costs, which were $291.9 million, $296.6 million and $293.9 million for the
fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively, are included in distribution,
selling and administrative expenses.

Supplier Reserves

The Company establishes reserves against amounts due from its suppliers relating to various
price and rebate incentives, including deductions or billings taken against payments otherwise due
them from the Company. These reserve estimates are established based on the judgment of Company
management after carefully considering the status of current outstanding claims, historical
experience with the suppliers, the specific incentive programs and any other pertinent information
available to the Company. The Company evaluates the amounts due from its suppliers on a continual
basis and adjusts the reserve estimates when appropriate based on changes in factual circumstances.
The ultimate outcome of any outstanding claim may be different than the Company’s estimate.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Effective October 1, 2009, the Company adopted the applicable sections of Accounting Standards
Codification (“ASC”) 805, “Business Combinations,” which provides revised guidance for recognizing
and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired, liabilities assumed, and any
non-controlling interest in the acquired business. Additionally, this ASC provides disclosure
requirements to enable users of financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects
of the business combination. The Company also adopted certain other applicable sections that
address application issues raised on the initial recognition and measurement, subsequent
measurement and accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities relating to contingencies from
a business combination. The Company expensed acquisition related costs of $3.2 million in the
fourth quarter ended September 30, 2011 relating to its completed or pending business combinations.

In June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards
Update (“ASU”) No. 2011-05, “Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income.” ASU No.
2011-05 requires an entity to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net
income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of
comprehensive income or in two separate, but consecutive statements. ASU No. 2011-05 is effective
for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2011,
and early adoption is permitted. The
Company is evaluating its presentation options under ASU No. 2011-05; however, it does not
expect adoption of this guidance to impact the Company’s consolidated financial statements other
than the change in presentation.



In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU No. 2011-08, “Intangibles — Goodwill and Other (Topic
350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment.” Under ASU No. 2011-08, an entity has the option to first
assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a
determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than
its carrying amount. If the entity determines that this threshold is not met, then performing the
two-step impairment test is unnecessary. ASU No. 2011-08 is effective for fiscal years that begin
after December 15, 2011, and early adoption is permitted. The Company intends to early adopt this
ASU in its fiscal year ending September 30, 2012.

Note 2. Acquisitions

In May 2009, the Company acquired Innomar Strategies Inc. (“Innomar”) for a purchase price of
$13.4 million, net of a working capital adjustment. Innomar is a Canadian pharmaceutical services
company that provides services within Canada to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,
including: strategic consulting and access solutions, specialty logistics management, patient
assistance and nursing services, and clinical research services. The acquisition of Innomar
expanded the Company’s business in Canada. The purchase price was allocated to the underlying
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired by
$8.3 million, which was allocated to goodwill. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired of
$4.6 million primarily consist of a trade name of $1.6 million and customer relationships of $2.6
million. The Company is amortizing the fair value of the acquired customer relationships over their
weighted average life of 10 years.

In September 2011, the Company acquired IntrinsiQ, LLC (“IntrinsiQ”) for a purchase price of
$34.3 million, net of a working capital adjustment. IntrinsiQ is a leading provider of informatics
solutions that help community oncologists make treatment decisions for their patients. The
acquisition of IntrinsiQ enhanced the Company’s proprietary data offerings to both physicians and
manufacturers. The purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities
assumed based upon their fair values at the date of acquisition. The purchase price exceeded the
fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired by $17.8 million, which was allocated
to goodwill. The fair value of the intangible assets acquired of $9.1 million primarily consists
of software technology of $4.6 million and customer relationships of $3.7 million. The Company is
amortizing the fair values of the acquired software technology and customer relationships over
their remaining useful lives of 8 years.

In September 2011, the Company acquired Premier Source (“Premier”) for a purchase price of
$11.1 million, net of cash acquired. Premier is a provider of consulting and reimbursement
services to medical device, pharmaceutical, molecular diagnostic, and biotechnology manufacturers,
as well as other health services companies. The acquisition of Premier complements the services
provided by AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (“ABCS”). The purchase price was allocated to
the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their fair values at the date of
acquisition. The purchase price exceeded the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets
acquired by $8.1 million, which was allocated to goodwill. The fair value of the intangible assets
acquired of $3.9 million primarily consists of customer relationships of $1.9 million and software
technology of $1.5 million. The Company is amortizing the fair values of the acquired customer
relationships and software technology over their remaining useful lives of 7 years and 6 years,
respectively.

Pro forma results of operations for the aforementioned acquisitions have not been presented
because the effects of revenue and earnings were not material to the consolidated financial
statements on either an individual or aggregate basis.

Note 3. Discontinued Operations

In October 2008, the Company completed the divestiture of its workers’ compensation business,
PMSI. Accordingly, PMSI’s operating results have been classified as discontinued in the
consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009. PMSI’s fiscal 2009
revenue and loss before income taxes were $29.0 million and $3.8 million, respectively.

The Company sold PMSI for approximately $31 million, net of a final working capital
adjustment, including a $19 million subordinated note payable due from PMSI on the fifth
anniversary of the closing date (the “maturity date”), of which $4 million was paid in October 2010
as PMSI achieved certain revenue targets with respect to its largest customer. Interest, which
accrues at an annual rate of LIBOR plus 4% (not to exceed 8%), is payable in cash on a quarterly
basis if PMSI achieves a defined minimum fixed charge coverage ratio or will be compounded
quarterly and paid at maturity.

All of the following tax carryforward information is presented as of September 30, 2011. The
Company had $7.9 million of potential tax benefits from federal net operating loss carryforwards
expiring in 10 to 19 years, and $49.3 million of potential tax benefits from state net operating
loss carryforwards expiring in 1 to 20 years and $0.7 million of potential tax benefits from
foreign net operating loss carryforwards expiring in 20 years. Included in the net operating loss
carryforwards is $3.5 million of potential tax benefits that if realized would be an increase to
additional paid-in-capital and $13.7 million of potential tax benefits that if realized would
reduce income tax expense. The Company had $0.7 million of state tax credit carryforwards. The
Company had $230.1 million of potential tax benefits from capital loss carryforwards expiring in 3
years.

In fiscal 2011, the Company increased the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $14.6
million primarily due to the addition of certain state net operating loss carryforwards. In fiscal
2010, the Company decreased the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by $7.2 million
primarily due to an adjustment to the initial capital loss carryforward resulting from the sale of
PMSI.

In fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, tax benefits of $39.7 million, $21.0 million, and $1.5
million, respectively, related to the exercise of employee stock options were recorded as
additional paid-in capital.

Income tax payments, net of refunds, were $214.6 million, $257.8 million and $192.9 million in
the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company files income tax returns in U.S. federal and state jurisdictions as well as
various foreign jurisdictions. In fiscal 2010, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) completed
its examination of the Company’s U.S. federal tax returns for fiscal 2006, 2007 and 2008. No
significant adjustments were made resulting from the IRS examination. In fiscal 2011, the Canada
Revenue Agency (“CRA”) completed its examination of the Company’s Canadian federal income tax
returns for fiscal 2007, 2008 and 2009. No significant adjustments were made resulting from the
CRA examination.

As of September 30, 2011 and 2010, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits, defined as the
aggregate tax effect of differences between tax return positions and the benefits recognized in the
Company’s financial statements, of $45.7 million and $55.9 million, respectively ($30.9 million and
$38.7 million, net of federal benefit, respectively). If recognized, these tax benefits would
reduce income tax expense and the effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2011 and 2010, included
in these amounts are $9.9 million and $19.1 million of interest and penalties, respectively, which
the Company records in income tax expense.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding
interest and penalties, in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows (in thousands):

approximately $6.5 million.

Long-Term Debt

In April 2011, the Company amended the Blanco revolving credit facility (the “Blanco Credit
Facility”) to extend the maturity date to April 2012. The Blanco Credit Facility is not classified
in the current portion of long-term debt on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at
September 30, 2011 because the Company has the ability and intent to refinance it on a long-term
basis. Borrowings under the Blanco Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Company. Interest on
borrowings under the Blanco Credit Facility accrues at specific rates based on the Company’s debt
rating (100 basis points over LIBOR at September 30, 2011).

In March 2011, the Company entered into a new multi-currency senior unsecured credit facility
for $700 million, which was scheduled to expire in March 2015 (the “Multi-Currency Revolving Credit
Facility”), with a syndicate of lenders. Interest on borrowings under the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility accrues at
specified rates based on the Company’s debt rating and ranges
from 87.5 basis points to 192.5 basis
points over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee, as
applicable (130 basis points
over LIBOR/EURIBOR/Bankers Acceptance Stamping Fee at
September 30, 2011). Additionally, interest on borrowings
denominated in Canadian dollars may accrue at the greater of the Canadian prime rate plus 30 basis
points or the CDOR rate. The Company pays facility fees to maintain the availability under the
Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility at specified rates based on the Company’s debt rating,
ranging from 12.5 basis points to 32.5 basis points, annually, of the
total commitment (20
basis points at September 30, 2011). In October 2011, the Company entered into an amendment
with the syndicate of lenders to extend the maturity date of the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit
Facility to October 2016. The amendment also reduced the Company’s borrowing rates and facility
fees. The Company may choose to repay or reduce its commitments under the Multi-Currency
Revolving Credit Facility at any time. The Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility contains
covenants, including compliance with a financial leverage ratio test, as well as others that impose
limitations on, among other things, indebtedness of excluded subsidiaries and asset sales.

The Company has $392.3 million of 5 5/8% senior notes due September 15, 2012 (the “2012
Notes”), $500 million of


/


% senior notes due September 15, 2015 (the “2015 Notes”), and $400
million of 4 7/8% senior notes due November 15, 2019 (the “2019 Notes”), (together, the “Notes”).
The 2012 Notes, 2015 Notes, and 2019 Notes were sold at 99.5%, 99.5%, and 99.2% of the principal
amount, respectively, and have an effective interest yield of 5.71%, 5.94%, and 4.98%,
respectively. Interest on the Notes is payable semiannually in arrears. Costs incurred in
connection with the issuance of the Notes were deferred and are being amortized over the terms of
the notes.

The indentures governing the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility and the Notes contain
restrictions and covenants which include limitations on additional indebtedness; distributions to stockholders; the repurchase of stock and the making of other restricted payments;
issuance of preferred stock; creation of certain liens; transactions with subsidiaries and other
affiliates; and certain corporate acts such as mergers, consolidations, and the sale of
substantially all assets. An additional covenant requires compliance with a financial leverage
ratio test.



Receivables Securitization Facility

The Company has a $700 million receivables securitization facility (“Receivables
Securitization Facility”), which was scheduled to expire in April 2014. The Company has
available to it an accordion feature whereby the commitment on the Receivables Securitization
Facility may be increased by up to $250 million, subject to lender approval, for seasonal needs
during the December and March quarters. Interest rates are currently based on prevailing market
rates for short-term commercial paper or LIBOR plus a program fee of
90 basis points. The Company pays an unused fee of 45 basis points, annually, to maintain the availability under the
Receivables Securitization Facility. At September 30, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding
under the Receivables Securitization Facility. In October 2011, the
Company entered into an amendment to the Receivables Securitization Facility to extend the maturity
date to October 2014. The amendment also reduced the Company’s borrowing rates. In connection with the Receivables Securitization
Facility, AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation sells on a revolving basis certain accounts receivable to Amerisource Receivables
Financial Corporation, a wholly owned special purpose entity, which in turn sells a percentage
ownership interest in the receivables to commercial paper conduits sponsored by financial
institutions. AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation is the servicer of the accounts receivable under the Receivables Securitization
Facility. After the maximum limit of receivables sold has been reached and as sold receivables are
collected, additional receivables may be sold up to the maximum amount available under the
facility. The facility is a financing vehicle utilized by the Company because it generally offers
an attractive interest rate relative to other financing sources. The Company securitizes its trade
accounts, which are generally non-interest bearing, in transactions that are accounted for as
borrowings. The Receivables Securitization Facility contains similar covenants to the
Multi—Currency Revolving Credit Facility.

Other Information

Scheduled future principal payments of long-term debt are $447.7 million in fiscal 2012,
$521.9 million in fiscal 2015, and $400.0 million in fiscal 2019.

Interest paid on the above indebtedness during the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011,
2010, and 2009 was $74.2 million, $63.8 million, and $56.9 million, respectively.

Total amortization of financing fees and the accretion of original issue discounts, which are
recorded as components of interest expense, were $4.7 million, $5.0 million, and $4.3 million, for
the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

Note 7. Stockholders’ Equity and Earnings per Share

The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 600,000,000 shares of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the “Preferred Stock”).

The board of directors is authorized to provide for the issuance of shares of Preferred Stock
in one or more series with various designations, preferences and relative, participating, optional
or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions. Except as required by law,
or as otherwise provided by the board of directors of the Company, the holders of Preferred Stock
will have no voting rights and will not be entitled to notice of meetings of stockholders. Holders
of Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when declared by the board of directors, out of
legally available funds, dividends at the rates fixed by the board of directors for the respective
series of Preferred Stock, and no more, before any dividends will be declared and paid, or set
apart for payment, on Common Stock with respect to the same dividend period. No shares of Preferred
Stock have been issued as of September 30, 2011.

The holders of the Company’s Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and have the
exclusive right to vote for the board of directors and for all other purposes as provided by law.
Subject to the rights of holders of the Company’s Preferred Stock, holders of Common Stock are
entitled to receive ratably on a per share basis such dividends and other distributions in cash,
stock or property of the Company as may be declared by the board of directors from time to time out
of the legally available assets or funds of the Company.

shares of its Common Stock for a total of $250.0 million. The Company had $500.0 million of
availability remaining under this share repurchase program as of September 30, 2011.

Basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of shares of
Common Stock outstanding during the periods presented. Diluted earnings per share is computed on
the basis of the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the periods
plus the dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock. The following table (in thousands)
is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the computation of basic and diluted
earnings per share.

Note 8. Pension and Other Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors various retirement benefit plans, including defined benefit pension
plans, defined contribution plans, postretirement medical plans and a deferred compensation plan
covering eligible employees. Expenses relating to these plans were $24.5 million, $22.2 million,
and $21.9 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.

The Company recognizes the funded status (the difference between the fair value of plan assets
and the projected benefit obligations) of its defined benefit pension plans and postretirement
benefit plans in its balance sheet, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other

September 30, 2011 are net actuarial losses of $81.1 million ($47.4 million, net of income taxes).
The net actuarial loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss that is expected to be amortized
into fiscal 2012 net periodic pension expense is $4.2 million ($2.4 million, net of income taxes).

Defined Benefit Plans

The Company provides a benefit for certain employees under two different noncontributory
defined benefit pension plans consisting of a salaried plan and a supplemental executive retirement
plan. Both plans are closed to new participants and benefits that can be earned by active
participants in the plans are limited. For each employee, the benefits are based on years of
service and average compensation. Pension costs, which are computed using the projected unit credit
cost method, are funded to at least the minimum level required by government regulations.

The Company has an unfunded supplemental executive retirement plan for certain former officers
and key employees. This plan is closed to new participants and benefits that can be earned by
active participants are limited. This plan is a “target” benefit plan, with the annual lifetime
benefit based upon a percentage of salary during the five final years of pay at age 62, offset by
several other sources of income including benefits payable under a prior supplemental retirement
plan.

To determine the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the Company considered the
current and expected asset allocations, as well as historical and expected returns on various
categories of plan assets.

The Compensation and Succession Planning Committee (“Compensation Committee”) of the Company’s
board of directors has delegated the administration of the pension and benefit plans to the
Company’s Benefits Committee, an internal committee, composed of senior finance, human resources
and legal executives. The Benefits Committee is responsible for oversight of the investment
management of the assets of the Company’s pension plans and the investment options under the
Company’s savings plans as well as the performance of the investment advisers and plan
administrators. The Benefits Committee has adopted an investment policy for the Company’s pension
plan, which includes guidelines regarding, among other things, the selection of acceptable asset
classes, allowable ranges of holdings, rebalancing of assets, the definition of acceptable
securities within each class, and investment performance expectations.

The investment portfolio contains a diversified portfolio of investment categories, including
equities, fixed income securities and cash. Securities are also diversified in terms of domestic
and international securities and large cap and small cap stocks. The actual and target asset
allocations expressed as a percentage of the plans’ assets at the measurement date are as follows:

Pension Benefits

The investment goals are to achieve the optimal return possible within the specific risk
parameters and, at a minimum, produce results, which achieve the plans’ assumed interest rate for
funding the plans over a full market cycle. High levels of risk and volatility are reduced by
maintaining diversified portfolios. Allowable investments include government-backed fixed income
securities, investment grade corporate bonds, residential backed mortgage securities, equity
securities and cash equivalents. Prohibited investments include unregistered or restricted stock,
commodities, margin trading, options and futures, short-selling, venture capital, private
placements, real estate and other high risk investments.

The fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets, totaling $122.2 million and $113.5
million at September 30, 2011 and 2010, respectively, is determined using a fair value hierarchy by
asset class. The fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs to
determine fair value. Level 1 refers to fair values determined based on unadjusted quoted prices
in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant
other observable inputs and Level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant non-observable
inputs.

The Company’s pension plan assets at September 30, 2011 were comprised of $0.9 million
invested in money market funds, $65.1 million invested in commingled equity funds, and $56.2
million invested in commingled fixed-income funds. The Company’s pension plan assets at September
30, 2010 were comprised of $0.7 million invested in money market funds, $69.7 million invested in
commingled equity funds, and $43.1 million invested in commingled fixed income funds. The fair
values of the money market funds were determined using the Level 1 hierarchy. The fair values of
the equity and fixed-income commingled funds, which have daily net asset values derived from the
underlying securities, were primarily determined by using the Level 2 hierarchy.



As of September 30, 2011 and 2010 all of the Company’s defined benefit pension plans had
accumulated and projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. The amounts related to
these plans were as follows (in thousands):

Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company provides medical benefits to certain retirees. The plans are closed to new
participants and benefits that can be earned by active participants are limited. Employees became
eligible for such postretirement benefits after meeting certain age and years of service criteria.
As a result of special termination benefit packages previously offered, the Company also provides
dental and life insurance benefits to a limited number of retirees and their dependents. These
benefit plans are unfunded.

Defined Contribution Plans

The Company sponsors the AmerisourceBergen Employee Investment Plan, which is a defined
contribution 401(k) plan covering salaried and certain hourly employees. Eligible participants may
contribute to the plan from 1% to 25% of their regular compensation before taxes. The Company
contributes $1.00 for each $1.00 invested by the participant up to the first 3% of the
participant’s salary and $0.50 for each additional $1.00 invested by the participant of up to an
additional 2% of salary. An additional discretionary contribution, in an amount not to exceed the
limits established by the Internal Revenue Code, may also be made depending upon the Company’s
performance. All contributions are invested at the direction of the employee in one or more funds.
All contributions vest immediately except for the discretionary contributions made by the Company
that vest in full after five years of credited service.

The Company also sponsors the AmerisourceBergen Corporation Supplemental 401(k) Plan. This
unfunded plan provides benefits for selected key management, including all of the Company’s
executive officers. This plan will provide eligible participants with an annual amount equal to 4%
of the participant’s base salary and bonus incentive to the extent that his or her compensation
exceeds the annual compensation limit established by Section 401(a) (17) of the Internal Revenue
Code.

Costs of the defined contribution plans charged to expense for the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $20.7 million, $18.1 million, and $21.1 million,
respectively.



Deferred Compensation Plan

The Company sponsors the AmerisourceBergen Corporation 2001 Deferred Compensation Plan. This
unfunded plan, under which 2.96 million shares of Common Stock are authorized for issuance, allows
eligible officers, directors and key management employees to defer a portion of their annual
compensation. The amount deferred may be allocated by the employee to cash, mutual funds or stock
credits. Stock credits, including dividend equivalents, are equal to the full and fractional number
of shares of Common Stock that could be purchased with the participant’s compensation allocated to
stock credits based on the average of closing prices of Common Stock during each month, plus, at
the discretion of the board of directors, up to one-half of a share of Common Stock for each full
share credited. Stock credit distributions are made in shares of Common Stock. No shares of Common
Stock have been issued under the deferred compensation plan through September 30, 2011. The
Company’s liability relating to its deferred compensation plan as of September 30, 2011 and 2010
was $8.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively.

Note 9. Share-Based Compensation

Stock Option Plans

The Company’s employee stock option plans provide for the granting of incentive and
nonqualified stock options to acquire shares of Common Stock to employees at a price not less than
the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date the option is granted. Option terms and
vesting periods are determined at the date of grant by the Compensation Committee of the board of
directors. Employee options generally vest ratably, in equal amounts, over a four-year service
period and expire in seven years (ten years for all grants issued prior to February 2008). The
Company’s non-employee director stock option plans provide for the granting of nonqualified stock
options to acquire shares of Common Stock to non-employee directors at the fair market value of the
Common Stock on the date of the grant. Non-employee director options vest ratably, in equal
amounts, over a three-year service period and expire in ten years.

At September 30, 2011, employee and non-employee director stock options for an additional 23.4
million shares may be granted under the AmerisourceBergen Corporation Equity Incentive Plan.

The estimated fair values of options granted are expensed as compensation on a straight-line
basis over the requisite service periods of the awards and are net of estimated forfeitures. The
Company estimates the fair values of option grants using a binomial option pricing model. Expected
volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock and other
factors, such as implied market volatility. The Company uses historical exercise data, taking into
consideration the optionees’ ages at grant date, to estimate the terms for which the options are
expected to be outstanding. The Company anticipates that the terms of options granted in the future
will be similar to those granted in the past. The risk-free rates during the terms of such options
are based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The weighted average fair values of the options granted during the fiscal years ended
September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $7.43, $5.82, and $4.18, respectively. The following
assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of options granted:

Changes to the above valuation assumptions could have a significant impact on share-based
compensation expense. During the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company
recorded stock option expense of $19.5 million, $22.5 million, and $17.4 million, respectively.

Restricted Stock Plan

Restricted shares vest in full after three years. The estimated fair value of restricted

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The stockholders approved the adoption of the AmerisourceBergen 2002 Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, under which up to an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares of Common Stock may be sold to eligible
employees (generally defined as employees with at least 30 days of service with the Company). Under
this plan, the participants may elect to have the Company withhold up to 25% of base salary to
purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock at a price equal to 95% of the fair market value of
the stock on the last business day of each six-month purchase period. Each participant is limited
to $25,000 of purchases during each calendar year. During the fiscal years ended September 30,
2011, 2010, and 2009, the Company acquired 106,959 shares, 220,367 shares, and 331,639 shares,
respectively, from the open market for issuance to participants in this plan. As of September 30,
2011, the Company has withheld $1.1 million from eligible employees for the purchase of additional
shares of Common Stock.

Note 10. Leases and Other Commitments

At September 30, 2011, future minimum payments totaling $215.5 million under noncancelable
operating leases with remaining terms of more than one fiscal year were due as follows; 2012 —
$43.8 million; 2013 — $37.8 million; 2014 — $31.5 million; 2015 — $26.6 million; 2016 — $22.7
million; and thereafter — $53.1 million. In the normal course of business, operating leases are
generally renewed or replaced by other leases. Certain operating leases include escalation
clauses. Total rental expense was $53.4 million in fiscal 2011, $61.7 million in fiscal 2010, and
$62.8 million in fiscal 2009.

The Company has commitments to purchase blood products from suppliers through December 31,
2012. The Company is required to purchase quantities at prices it believes will represent market
prices. The Company currently estimates its remaining purchase commitment under these agreements
will be approximately $121.2 million as of September 30, 2011, of which $95.7 million represents
the Company’s commitment in fiscal 2012.

The Company outsources to IBM Global Services (“IBM”) a significant portion of its corporate
and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation information technology activities including assistance with the implementation of the
Company’s new enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system. The remaining commitment under the
Company’s ten-year arrangement, as amended, which expires in June 2015, is approximately $128.6
million as of September 30, 2011, of which $39.4 million represents the Company’s commitment in
fiscal 2012.

During fiscal 2008, the Company announced a more streamlined organizational structure and
introduced an initiative (“cE2”) designed to drive increased customer efficiency and cost
effectiveness. In connection with these efforts, the Company reduced various operating costs and
terminated certain positions. During fiscal 2009, the Company terminated 197 employees and
incurred $3.1 million of employee severance costs relating to the cE2 initiative.

During fiscal 2009, the Company recorded $2.2 million of expense to increase its liability
relating to an executive employee matter. During fiscal 2010, as a result of a final settlement of
the executive employee matter, the Company reversed its liability relating to this matter by $4.4
million.

During fiscal 2011, the Company introduced its Energiz program, which encompasses a
combination of initiatives to maximize salesforce productivity, improve customer contractual
compliance, and drive efficiency by linking the Company’s information technology capabilities more
effectively with its operations. In connection with the Energiz program, the Company terminated
103 employees and incurred $4.4 million of severance costs. Employees receive their severance
benefits over a period of time, generally not in excess of 12 months, or in the form of a lump-sum
payment.

In October 2011, the Company entered into a preliminary settlement agreement with respect to
the Qui Tam Matter (see Note 12). The Company accrued $16.0 million relating to this settlement,
which is expected to be paid in fiscal 2012.

Note 12. Legal Matters and Contingencies

In the ordinary course of its business, the Company becomes involved in lawsuits,
administrative proceedings, government subpoenas, and government investigations, including
antitrust, commercial, environmental, product liability, intellectual property, regulatory,
employment discrimination, and other matters. Significant damages or penalties may be sought from
the Company in some matters, and some matters may require years for the Company to resolve. The
Company establishes reserves based on its periodic assessment of estimates of probable losses.
There can be no assurance that an adverse resolution of one or more matters during any subsequent
reporting period will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations for
that period or on the Company’s financial condition.



Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care Civil Rebate Payment Order and Civil Complaint

On April 27, 2009, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (“OMH”) notified the
Company’s Canadian subsidiary, AmerisourceBergen Canada Corporation (“ABCC”), that it had entered a
Rebate Payment Order requiring ABCC to pay C$5.8 million to the Ontario Ministry of Finance. OMH
maintains that it has reasonable grounds to believe that ABCC accepted rebates, directly or
indirectly, in violation of the Ontario Drug Interchangeability and Dispensing Fee Act. OMH at the
same time announced similar rebate payment orders against other wholesalers, generic manufacturers,
pharmacies, and individuals. ABCC was cooperating fully with OMH prior to the entry of the Order by
responding fully to requests for information and/or documents and will continue to cooperate. ABCC
filed an appeal of the Order pursuant to OMH procedures in May 2009. In addition, on the same day
that the Order was issued, OMH notified ABCC that it had filed a civil complaint with Health Canada
(department of the Canadian government responsible for national public health) against ABCC for
potential violations of the Canadian Food and Drug Act. Health Canada subsequently conducted an
audit of ABCC, and ABCC has cooperated fully with Health Canada in the conduct of the audit. The
Company has met several times, including most recently in April 2011, with representatives of OMH
to present its position on the Rebate Payment Order. Although the Company believes that ABCC has
not violated the relevant statutes and regulations and has conducted its business consistent with
widespread industry practices, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters.

Qui Tam Matter

On October 24, 2011, the Company announced that it had reached a preliminary agreement for a
civil settlement (the “Preliminary Settlement”) with the United States Attorney’s Office for the
Eastern District of New York, the plaintiff states and the relator (collectively, the “Plaintiffs”)
of claims against two of the Company’s business units, ASD Specialty Healthcare, Inc. (“ASD”) and
International Nephrology Network (“INN”), who were named, along with Amgen Inc., in a civil case
filed under the qui tam provisions of the federal and various state civil False Claims Acts. The
civil case was administratively closed after the Preliminary Settlement was reached. The
Preliminary Settlement is subject to completion and approval of an executed written settlement
agreement with the Plaintiffs, which the Company expects to finalize in its fiscal year ending
September 30, 2012. The Company does not expect INN or ASD to admit any liability in connection
with the settlement. The Company recorded a $16 million charge in the fiscal year ended September
30, 2011 in connection with the Preliminary Settlement.

The qui tam provisions of False Claims Acts permit a private person, known as a relator, to
file civil actions under these statutes on behalf of the federal and state governments. The qui
tam complaint against Amgen, ASD and INN was initially filed under seal by a former Amgen employee
in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the “ District
of Massachusetts case”). The Company first learned of the matter on January 21, 2009 when it received notice that
the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of New York was investigating allegations in
the sealed civil complaint. On October 30, 2009, 14 states filed a complaint to intervene in the
case. However, following the resolution of a number of motions, including a motion to dismiss,
filed in the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts and appeals filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the
First Circuit in connection with the matter, only six states (California, Illinois, Indiana,
Massachusetts, New Mexico and New York) and the relator were permitted to proceed with their
complaints until the case was administratively closed in connection with the Preliminary
Settlement. The allegations in the closed case related to the distribution and sale of Amgen’s
anemia drug, Aranesp. ASD is a distributor of pharmaceuticals to physician practices and INN is a
group purchasing organization for nephrologists and nephrology practices. The plaintiff states
and/or the relator alleged that from 2002 through 2009 Amgen, ASD and INN offered remuneration to
medical providers in violation of federal and state health laws to increase purchases and
prescriptions of Aranesp and that these violations caused medical providers to submit false
certifications and false claims for payment in violation of the federal and state civil False
Claims Acts. Amgen, ASD and INN were also alleged to have caused healthcare providers to bill
federal and state healthcare programs for Aranesp that was either not administered or administered,
but medically unnecessary.

The Company has learned that there are prior and subsequent filings in one or more federal
district courts, including a complaint filed by one of its former employees, that are under seal
and involve allegations against the Company (and/or subsidiaries or businesses of the Company,
including its group purchasing organization for oncologists and its oncology distribution business)
similar to those raised in the District of Massachusetts case. The
Preliminary Settlement encompasses resolution of one of these other filings. The Company cannot predict
the outcome of any other pending action in which any AmerisourceBergen entity is or may become a
defendant.



Note 13. Litigation Settlements

Antitrust Settlements

During the last several years, numerous class action lawsuits have been filed against certain
brand pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging that the manufacturer, by itself or in concert with
others, took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drugs from entering the market. The
Company has not been a named plaintiff in any of these class actions, but has been a member of the
direct purchasers’ class (i.e., those purchasers who purchase directly from these pharmaceutical
manufacturers). None of the class actions has gone to trial, but some have settled in the past with
the Company receiving proceeds from the settlement funds. During the fiscal years ended September
30, 2011 and 2010, the Company recognized gains of $2.1 million and $20.7 million, respectively,
relating to the above-mentioned class action lawsuits. These gains, which are net of attorney fees
and estimated payments due to other parties, were recorded as reductions to cost of goods sold in
the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. There were no gains recognized during the
fiscal year ended September 30, 2009.

Note 14. Business Segment Information

The Company is organized based upon the products and services it provides to its customers.
The Company’s operations are comprised of one reportable segment, Pharmaceutical Distribution. The
Pharmaceutical Distribution reportable segment represents the consolidated operating results of the
Company and is comprised of four operating segments, which include the operations of
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (“ABDC”), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (“ABSG”),
AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (“ABCS”), and AmerisourceBergen Packaging Group (“ABPG”).
Prior to fiscal 2011, the business operations of ABCS were included within ABSG.

The Company has aggregated the operating segments of ABDC, ABSG, ABCS, and ABPG into one
reportable segment, the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment. Its ability to aggregate these four
operating segments into one reportable segment was based on the following:

•

the objective and basic principles of ASC 280;

•

the aggregation criteria as noted in ASC 280; and

•

the fact that ABDC, ABSG, ABCS, and ABPG have similar economic characteristics.

The chief operating decision maker for the Pharmaceutical Distribution segment is the
President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company whose function is to allocate resources to,
and assess the performance of, the ABDC, ABSG, ABCS, and ABPG operating segments. ABDC, ABSG, ABCS,
and ABPG each have an executive who functions as an operating segment manager whose role includes
reporting directly to the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company on their respective
operating segment’s business activities, financial results and operating plans.

The businesses of the Pharmaceutical Distribution operating segments are similar in that they
service both healthcare providers and pharmaceutical manufacturers in the pharmaceutical supply
channel. The distribution of pharmaceutical drugs has historically represented more than 95% of the
Company’s revenues. ABDC and ABSG each operate in a high volume and low margin environment and, as
a result, their economic characteristics are similar. Each operating segment warehouses and
distributes products in a similar manner. Additionally, each operating segment is subject, in whole
or in part, to the same extensive regulatory environment under which the pharmaceutical
distribution industry operates.

ABDC distributes a comprehensive offering of brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals,
over-the-counter healthcare products, home healthcare supplies and equipment, and related services
to a wide variety of healthcare providers, including acute care hospitals and health systems,
independent and chain retail pharmacies, mail order pharmacies, medical clinics, long-term care and
other alternate site pharmacies and other customers. ABDC also provides pharmacy management,
staffing and other consulting services; scalable automated pharmacy dispensing equipment;
medication and supply dispensing cabinets; and supply management software to a variety of retail
and institutional healthcare providers.

ABSG, through a number of operating businesses, provides distribution and other services
primarily to physicians who specialize in a variety of disease states, especially oncology, and to
other alternate healthcare providers, including dialysis clinics. ABSG also distributes plasma and
other blood products, injectible pharmaceuticals and vaccines. Additionally, ABSG provides third
party logistics and other services for biotechnology and other pharmaceutical manufacturers.



ABCS, through a number of operating businesses, provides commercialization support services
including reimbursement support programs, outcomes research, contract field staffing, patient
assistance and copay assistance programs, adherence programs, risk mitigation services, and other
market access programs to pharmaceutical and biotechnology manufacturers.

ABPG consists of American Health Packaging, Anderson Packaging (“Anderson”), and Brecon.
American Health Packaging delivers unit dose, punch card, unit-of-use, compliance and other
packaging solutions to institutional and retail healthcare providers. American Health Packaging’s
largest customer is ABDC, and, as a result, its operations are closely aligned with the operations
of ABDC. Anderson and Brecon (based in the United Kingdom) are leading providers of contract
packaging and also provide clinical trial materials services for pharmaceutical manufacturers. Beginning in
fiscal 2012, to increase operating efficiencies and to better align the Company’s operations, each
business unit within ABPG will be combined with ABDC or ABCS. More specifically, the operations of
American Health Packaging will be combined with the ABDC operating segment and the operations of
Anderson and Brecon will be combined with the ABCS operating segment.

The Company has a diverse customer base that includes institutional and retail healthcare
providers as well as pharmaceutical manufacturers. Institutional healthcare providers include acute
care hospitals, health systems, mail order pharmacies, long-term care
and other alternate care pharmacies and providers of pharmacy services to such facilities, and
physician offices. Retail healthcare providers include national and regional retail drugstore
chains, independent community pharmacies and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass
merchandisers. The Company is typically the primary source of supply for its healthcare provider
customers. The Company’s manufacturing customers include branded, generic and biotechnology
manufacturers of prescribed pharmaceuticals, as well as over-the-counter product and health and
beauty aid manufacturers. In addition, the Company offers a broad range of value-added solutions
designed to enhance the operating efficiencies and competitive positions of its customers, thereby
allowing them to improve the delivery of healthcare to patients and consumers. In fiscal 2011,
revenue was comprised of 71% institutional customers and 29% retail customers.

The Company operates as a single reportable segment as a provider of pharmaceutical
distribution and related services, with fiscal 2011 revenue of $80.2 billion, including foreign
operations in Canada and the United Kingdom. For the fiscal years ended September 30, 2011, 2010,
and 2009 the Company’s revenue from foreign operations in Canada and the United Kingdom totaled
$1.5 billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2011 and 2010,
long-lived assets of the Company’s foreign operations in Canada and the United Kingdom totaled
$142.3 million and $148.4 million, respectively.

Note 15. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The recorded amounts of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and
accounts payable at September 30, 2011 and 2010 approximate fair value based upon the relatively
short-term nature of these financial instruments. Within cash and cash equivalents, the Company
had $491.1 million and $1,552.4 million of investments in money market accounts as of September 30,
2011 and 2010, respectively, which were valued as Level 1 investments. The recorded amount of debt
(see Note 6) and the corresponding fair value, which is estimated based on quoted market prices, as
of September 30, 2011 were $1,365.0 million and $1,507.0 million, respectively. The recorded amount
of debt and the corresponding fair value, which is estimated based on quoted market prices, as of
September 30, 2010 were $1,343.6 million and $1,486.3 million, respectively.

Note 17. Subsequent Events

Business Acquisition

On November 1, 2011, the Company acquired TheraCom, LLC (“TheraCom”), a subsidiary of CVS
Caremark Corporation, for a purchase price of $250.0 million, subject to a working capital
adjustment. TheraCom is a leading provider of commercialization support services to the
biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, specifically providing reimbursement and patient access
support services. TheraCom’s capabilities complement those of the Lash Group and will
significantly increase the size and scope of consulting services being provided by the Company’s
ABCS operating segment. TheraCom’s annualized revenues are approximately $700 million, the
majority of which are provided by the specialized distribution component of the integrated
reimbursement support services for certain unique prescription products. Approximately $60 million
of these revenues were from sales to ABDC, which will be eliminated in the Company’s future
consolidated financial statements.

Commercial Paper Program

On October 31, 2011, the Company established a commercial paper program whereby it may from
time to time issue short-term promissory notes in an aggregate amount of up to $700 million at any
one time. Amounts available under the program may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed from time to
time. The maturities on the notes will vary, but may not exceed 365 days from the date of
issuance. The notes will bear interest rates, if interest bearing, or will be sold at a discount
from their face amounts. The commercial paper program is fully backed by the Company’s
Multi-Currency Revolving Credit Facility.

Issuance of $500 Million of 3


/


% Senior Notes Due 2021

In November 2011, the Company issued $500 million of 3


/


% senior notes due November 15, 2021
(the “2021 Notes”). The 2021 Notes were sold at 99.858% of the principal amount and have an
effective yield of 3.52%. The interest on the 2021 Notes is payable semiannually, in arrears,
commencing May 15, 2012. The 2021 Notes rank pari passu to the Multi-Currency Revolving Credit
Facility and the 2012 Notes, the 2015 Notes, and the 2019 Notes. The Company will use the net
proceeds of the 2021 Notes for general corporate purposes. Cost incurred in connection with the
issuance of the 2021 Notes will be deferred and amortized over the
ten-year term of the notes.

Note 18. Selected Consolidating Financial Statements of Parent, Guarantors and Non-Guarantors

The Company’s 2012 Notes, the 2015 Notes, the 2019 Notes (together, the “Notes”) each are
fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several basis by certain of the Company’s
subsidiaries (the subsidiaries of the Company that are guarantors of the Notes being referred to
collectively as the “Guarantor Subsidiaries”). The total assets, stockholders’ equity, revenues,
earnings and cash flows from operating activities of the Guarantor Subsidiaries reflect the
majority of the consolidated total of such items as of or for the periods reported. The only
consolidated subsidiaries of the Company that are not guarantors of the Notes (the “Non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries”) are: (a) the receivables securitization special purpose entity described in Note 6,
(b) the foreign operating subsidiaries and (c) certain smaller operating subsidiaries. The
following tables present condensed consolidating financial statements including AmerisourceBergen
Corporation (the “Parent”), the Guarantor Subsidiaries, and the Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries. Such
financial statements include balance sheets as of September 30, 2011 and 2010 and the related
statements of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September
30, 2011.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

None.

ITEM 9A.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are intended to ensure that
information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports submitted under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. These controls and
procedures also are intended to ensure that information required to be disclosed in such reports is
accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosures.

The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, with the participation of
other members of the Company’s management, have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a — 15(e) and 15d — 15(e)
under the Exchange Act) and have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures
were effective for their intended purposes as of the end of the period covered by this report.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

There were no changes during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2011 in the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to
materially affect, those controls.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The management of AmerisourceBergen Corporation (“AmerisourceBergen” or the “Company”) is
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
AmerisourceBergen’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

(i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;

(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance
with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and

(iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

AmerisourceBergen’s management assessed the effectiveness of AmerisourceBergen’s internal
control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011. In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on management’s assessment and those
criteria, management has concluded that AmerisourceBergen’s internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of September 30, 2011. AmerisourceBergen’s independent registered public
accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of
AmerisourceBergen’s internal control over financial reporting. This report is set forth on the next
page.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

The Board of Directors and Stockholders of AmerisourceBergen Corporation

We have audited internal control over financial reporting of AmerisourceBergen Corporation and
subsidiaries as of September 30, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control —
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(the COSO criteria). AmerisourceBergen Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately
and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and
directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent
or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and subsidiaries maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2011, based on
the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of AmerisourceBergen Corporation
and subsidiaries as of September 30, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of
operations, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended September 30, 2011 and our report dated November 22, 2011 expressed an unqualified
opinion thereon.
