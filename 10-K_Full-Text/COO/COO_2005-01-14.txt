Item 1.

Business

.

The Cooper
Companies, Inc. (the “Company,” “Cooper,” “we” and similar pronouns), through its principal business units, markets, develops and manufactures healthcare products. Cooper is a Delaware corporation that was organized in
1980.

CooperVision (CVI) markets, develops and manufactures a broad range of
contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market. It specializes in toric lenses that correct astigmatism, cosmetic lenses that change the appearance of the color of the eye, and other lenses, primarily high growth, specialty and value-added
market segments around the world. Its leading products are disposable and planned replacement toric and spherical lenses. CooperSurgical (CSI) markets, develops and manufactures



medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians.

CVI and CSI each operate in a highly competitive environment. Competition in the medical
device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations in the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of disease. Both of Cooper’s businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation,
technological benefit, service and reliability.

COOPERVISION

We estimate that the worldwide soft contact lens market grew about 14
percent during 2004 to about $4 billion annually. In the United States, about 38 percent of the worldwide market, revenue grew about 7 percent to $1.5 billion, while revenue in countries outside the United States grew 19 percent to $2.5 billion.

Japan and the Pacific Rim countries, about $1.2 billion or 30 percent of the
world market, grew about 26 percent. Europe, about $1 billion or 25 percent of the market, grew about 18 percent.

Favorable demographics, an increase in the reported incidence of myopia, a slowing of the contact lens wearers drop out rates, and a continuing shift in practitioner
preferences from low-featured “commodity” lenses to higher-value specialty lenses support a favorable world market outlook.

CooperVision is particularly strong in the specialty lens segments of the market: toric lenses that correct astigmatism, cosmetic lenses that change or enhance the
appearance of the color of the eye, lenses for patients who experience the symptoms of dry eye syndrome, long-term extended wear lenses and multifocal lenses for presbyopia – the blurring of near vision that occurs with aging.

These product lines offer contact lens wearers more benefits that include improved visual
acuity and added comfort. CooperVision estimates that specialty lenses currently account for about 30 percent or $1.2 billion of the worldwide contact lens market, about 40 percent of the U.S. market and about 20 percent of the market outside the
U.S. where, with its broad specialty products lines, CVI has an exceptional opportunity to expand their acceptance.

CVI’s 2004 Revenue Growth

CVI’s revenue grew 18 percent in 2004. In contrast, we estimate that the world market grew about 14 percent before currency translation adjustment of about 6
percent. CVI’s revenue in the United States grew 12 percent and 24 percent in markets outside the U.S. CVI now holds about 13 percent of the United States market and about 10 percent of the worldwide market, the latter up from 6 percent three
years ago.

Specialty Contact Lenses

Specialty contact lenses meet the visual correction needs of patients whose requirements go
beyond the correction of near- and farsightedness. We estimate that products in these categories account for about one-third of worldwide contact lens revenue.

In the United States, we estimate that sales of specialty products are about $700 million, above 45 percent of the total United States market. In addition to toric and
cosmetic lenses, multifocal lenses,



lenses for patients who experience the symptoms of dry eye syndrome, and long-term extended wear lenses also offer attractive business opportunities. In
2004, sales of CVI’s toric lenses, its most extensive product line, grew 22 percent and now account for about 40 percent of its total revenue. We estimate that the worldwide toric market grew about 18 percent during this period.

Worldwide, growth in the cosmetic lens market remained flat. We estimate sales
of approximately $250 million in this category – about $175 million in the United States.

New Specialty Contact Lens Products

During 2004, CVI expanded its product offerings:

•

Two-week disposable toric lens to correct astigmatism introduced in Japan.

•

Proclear

®

disposable multifocal, a disposable product for wearers with both presbyopia, the blurring of vision that occurs with aging, and the symptoms of dry eye syndrome, introduced in European markets.

CVI Growth in Markets Outside the United States

In 2004, CVI’s revenue in markets outside the United States grew 24
percent and now represents about 52 percent of its sales.

Europe

CVI’s European revenue grew about 25 percent over 2003 with strength
in sales of toric lenses, which grew 42 percent. CVI estimates that it is the third largest contact lens supplier in Europe, with business units in Holland, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Spain and the United Kingdom, a subsidiary and an exclusive
distributor in France and an exclusive distributor in Germany.

Far East

CVI’s revenue in Japan and the Pacific Rim grew about 27% over 2003,
the year Rohto Pharmaceutical Company, Ltd. introduced CVI’s line of frequently replaced lenses including spherical, aspheric and toric lenses. Japan is the second largest contact lens market in the world after the United States, and soft lens
popularity continues to grow. CVI estimates that the total market for soft contact lenses in Japan and the Pacific Rim today is about $1.2 billion, compared to about $1.5 billion in the United States. The Japanese market, growing in the mid-teens
percent per year, is largely made up of daily and two-week disposable lenses, representing about 75 percent of the market.

The incidence of nearsightedness in Japan is one of the highest in the world. About 80 percent of the nearsighted population has some degree of astigmatism, significantly
greater than the 50 percent rate reported in the United States. About half of those with astigmatism are potential candidates for toric lenses. The Japanese toric segment, currently a smaller percentage of the total market than it is in the U.S., is
expected to grow rapidly as newer generations of toric lenses are introduced.

CVI Competition

A number of manufacturers compete in the
worldwide market for contact lenses, which was approximately $4 billion in 2004. The three largest are Johnson & Johnson’s Vistakon division, CIBA Vision/Wesley Jessen (owned by Novartis AG) and Bausch & Lomb Incorporated.



The contact lens market has two major segments. The larger “commodity” segment, about $2.8 billion in 2004, is
comprised of lenses that only correct near- and farsightedness. The smaller “specialty” segment, about $1.2 billion in 2004, is comprised of lenses that address special needs of contact lens patients and includes toric, cosmetic,
multifocal and premium lenses. CooperVision competes successfully in the contact lens market primarily by offering specialty lenses and secondarily by offering commodity lenses. About 62% of CVI’s sales are specialty lenses.

To compete successfully in the contact lens market, companies must market differentiated
products priced competitively and, therefore, manufactured efficiently. CVI believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses (lathing, cast molding and FIPS, a cost effective
combination of lathing and molding). This manufacturing flexibility means that CVI can:

•

Develop more lens types for patients than competitors (two-week, monthly and quarterly disposable and custom toric products, the latter for patients with a high amount of
astigmatism).

•

Offer a wider range of lens parameters, leading to a more successful fitting with better visual acuity.

In addition, CVI believes that its lenses provide superior comfort through its use of the lens edge technology provided under the patents
covered by its Edge Patent License described under “Patents, Trademarks and Licensing Agreements.” CVI also sponsors clinical studies to generate medical information to improve its lenses.

In order to enhance its competitiveness in the specialty market, Cooper acquired
Biocompatibles Eye Care, Inc. (Biocompatibles), the contact lens business of Biocompatibles plc., in February 2002. Biocompatibles’ Proclear

®

line spherical, multifocal and toric lenses, are manufactured with omafilcon A, a material that incorporates the proprietary phosphorylcholine
technology that helps enhance tissue-device compatibility. Proclear

®

is the only lens with FDA clearance for the claim “… may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear.” Mild
discomfort relating to dryness during lens wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear.

Toric contact lenses correct astigmatism (irregularities of the cornea) and accounted for about 13 percent of the total worldwide contact lens market in 2004. CVI’s
toric lens sales represented about one-third of this market segment in 2004.

The toric market segment is highly competitive. CVI’s primary toric competitors are CIBA Vision/Wesley Jessen (owned by Novartis AG), Bausch & Lomb Incorporated and Johnson & Johnson’s Vistakon division. Ocular Sciences,
Inc. also competed in the toric market. Toric lens manufacturers compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters, superior wearing comfort and a high level of
customer service, both for patients and contact lens practitioners. CVI believes that its three manufacturing processes yield a wider range of toric lens parameters than its competitors, providing greater patient and practitioner satisfaction and
better visual acuity, and that it offers superior customer services, including high standards of on-time product delivery.

Major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces than CVI. Nevertheless, CVI offers a high level of
customer service through its several direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service



representatives who consult with eyecare professionals about the use of the Company’s lens products. CVI believes that its sales force is particularly
well equipped through extensive training to meet the needs of contact lens practitioners and their customers.

CVI also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects. The Company believes that CVI will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses, particularly
in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction market is low, offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share. The Company also believes that laser vision correction is not a material threat to its sales
of contact lenses because each modality serves a different demographic group. Almost all new contact lens wearers are in their teens or twenties, while refractive surgical procedures are performed primarily on patients in their late thirties or
early forties.

COOPERSURGICAL

Historically, many small medical device companies have supplied the women’s healthcare
market with a wide range of products through a fragmented distribution system. CSI’s strategy is to identify and acquire selected smaller companies and product lines that improve its existing market position or serve new clinical areas,
particularly opportunities in aging and infertility.

Cooper’s strong cash
flow allows CSI to readily compete for these opportunities, and CSI is now a leader in women’s healthcare, having added 25 major products or product lines since 1994.

Women’s Health Background

Medical economists expect patient visits to obstetricians and gynecologists (Ob/Gyns) to increase by 13 percent over the next decade. Driving this growth is a large group
of women of childbearing age and a rapidly growing middle-aged population with emerging gynecologic concerns. Consistent with an aging population, menopausal problems – abnormal bleeding, incontinence and osteoporosis – will increase,
while pregnancy, contraceptive management and general examinations are expected to remain stable. The trend toward delaying the age of childbearing to the mid-thirties and beyond will drive increasing treatment for infertility.

Women between the ages of 18 and 44 generate the highest number of office visits and hospital
admissions. While general medical practitioners play an important role in women’s primary care, about one-third of all office visits for this age group are to the Ob/Gyn who are, therefore, the primary market target for associated medical
devices. There are nearly 30,000 Ob/Gyn’s under the age of 65 practicing at nearly 13,700 locations in the United States, and women account for nearly 60 percent of all inpatient hospital stays.

Some significant features of this market are:

•

Two-thirds of patient visits are for annual checkups, cancer screening, menstrual disorders, vaginitis (inflammation of vaginal tissue), osteoporosis and the management of
menopause; the remainder are for pregnancy and reproductive management.

•

Osteoporosis (reduction in bone mass) and incontinence have become frequent diagnoses as the female population ages. Early identification and treatment of these conditions will both
improve women’s health and help reduce costs. Each of these conditions costs the U.S. healthcare system about $15 billion annually according to government estimates.



•

Sterilization is the most frequently performed surgical procedure – about 700,000 annually. Each year, an estimated 4.5 million patients visit physicians for monitoring and
treatment of abnormal Pap smears.

•

About 1.2 million women and their partners consult medical practitioners for infertility annually, with the Ob/Gyn traditionally providing the initial evaluation. Ovulatory drugs
and intrauterine insemination (IUI) are used to treat the majority of these cases. In addition, about 400 assisted reproductive technology clinics in the U.S. perform nearly 100,000 embryo transfer procedures each year that result in nearly 35,000
infants.

CSI’s 2004 Revenue Growth

During 2004, CSI revenue grew 23 percent to $101.5 million, representing 21 percent of
Cooper’s revenue. Its operating margin reached 21 percent for the fiscal year, below last year’s 22 percent as the Company elected to invest in expanding its sales force to stimulate organic revenue growth rates.

CSI Competition

CSI focuses on selected segments of the women’s healthcare market, supplying high quality diagnostic products and surgical instruments
and accessories. In some instances, CSI offers all of the products needed for a complete procedure. The market segments in which CSI competes continue to be fragmented, typified by smaller technology-driven firms that generally offer only one or two
product lines. Most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than Cooper. Competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances, product
quality, price, customer service and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals. CSI believes that it competes successfully against these companies with its superior sales and marketing, the technological advantages
of its products and by developing and acquiring new products, including those used in new medical procedures. In addition, as CSI expands its product line, it offers to train medical professionals how to use them.

During 2004, following the acquisition of Milex, CSI implemented an initiative to expand its
sales and marketing efforts in order to increase organic growth over the next several years. These programs will focus on CSI’s products in the incontinence, infertility and female sterilization markets using its restructured sales force of
independent and direct sales representatives.

PROFILES OF RECENT
ACQUISITIONS

Ocular Sciences, Inc. –

See Note 13,
“Subsequent Events”

On January 6, 2005, Cooper acquired all of the
outstanding common stock of Ocular Sciences, Inc. (Ocular), pursuant to the July 28, 2004 definitive merger agreement. Ocular is a global manufacturer and marketer of soft contact lenses, primarily spherical and daily disposable contact lenses that
are brand and product differentiated by distribution channel. The aggregate consideration paid for the stock of Ocular was about $1.2 billion plus transaction costs, less acquired cash. Cooper paid approximately $600 million in cash and issued
approximately 10.7 million shares of its common stock to Ocular stockholders and option holders. Under the terms of the acquisition, each share of Ocular common stock was converted into the right to receive 0.3879 of a share of Cooper common stock
and $22.00 in cash without interest, plus cash for fractional shares. Outstanding Ocular stock options were redeemed



in exchange for a combination of cash and Cooper stock for the spread between their exercise prices and the value of the merger consideration immediately
prior to closing.

Opti-Centre

In March 2004, CVI acquired all the outstanding shares and certain patents of Les
Laboratoires Opti-Centre, Inc., a Quebec-based contact lens manufacturer, which holds the patents covering CooperVision’s multifocal lens design technology used in its Frequency

®

and Proclear

®

multifocal products.

Argus Biomedical Pty Ltd

In February 2004, CVI acquired from Argus Biomedical Pty Ltd the assets related to AlphaCor

®

, an artificial cornea, and AlphaSphere

®

, a soft orbital implant. Argus is a privately owned company with its origins in the biomaterial and polymer research
group of the Lions Eye Institute in Western Australia.

The AlphaCor

®

artificial cornea is a synthetic one-piece device
designed to replace a diseased or damaged cornea or a failed human corneal graft. AlphaSphere

®

is a soft orbital implant that Argus is currently developing. Orbital implants are required when an eye is lost due to disease or trauma. The orbital implant occupies the space usually
filled by the eyeball and provides substantial cosmetic benefits to the patient.

The Argus products are being developed and marketed to corneal surgeons by CooperVision’s ophthalmic surgery business unit, CooperVision Surgical, Inc.

Milex

In February 2004, CSI acquired Milex Products, Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of obstetric and gynecologic products and customized print services. Milex is a leading
supplier of pessaries – products used to medically manage female urinary incontinence and pelvic support conditions – and also supplies cancer screening products, including endometrial and endocervical sampling devices and a breast biopsy
needle for fine needle aspiration. Milex also publishes patient education materials that discuss prenatal and pregnancy issues, breast health, menopause and osteoporosis.

SURx, Inc.

In November 2003, CSI purchased from privately-held SURx, Inc., the assets and associated worldwide license rights for the Laparoscopic (LP) and Transvaginal (TV) product
lines of its Radio Frequency (RF) Bladder Neck Suspension technology, which uses radio frequency based thermal energy instead of implants to restore continence.

RF Bladder Neck Suspension is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat genuine stress incontinence. Using low power, bipolar RF energy, the procedure shrinks
tissue in the pelvic floor to lift the urethra and bladder neck to a more normal anatomical position. This procedure can be performed using either a laparoscopic or a transvaginal approach.

The SURx

®

System consists of a small, lightweight 15 watt SURx

®

Radio Frequency Generator that delivers RF energy to a single-use handheld applicator
for each surgical approach.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Our Company-sponsored research and development expenditures during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $6.5 million, $5.6 million and $4.3
million, respectively, representing 1% of net sales in each fiscal year. During fiscal 2004, CooperVision spent 61% and CooperSurgical spent 39% of the total. We did not participate in any customer-sponsored research and development programs.

Cooper employs 33 people in its research and development and manufacturing
engineering departments. Outside specialists in lens design, formulation science, polymer chemistry, microbiology and biochemistry support product development and clinical research for CVI products. CSI conducts research and development in-house and
also employs outside surgical specialists, including members of its surgical advisory board.

CVI continues to invest in two research programs: the development of an extended wear contact lens and an improved contact lens technology. Most of our R&D expense, other than the two programs, is for clinical,
regulatory and other product development activities and not for basic research.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA), other federal agencies and various foreign ministries of health regulate the development, testing, production and marketing of the Company’s products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other statutes and regulations govern the
testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion of these products. If applicable regulations are not followed, companies may be subject to fines, product recall or seizure, suspension of production and criminal prosecution.

Both CVI and CSI develop and market medical devices under different levels of
FDA regulation depending on the classification of the device. Class III devices, such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses, require extensive premarket testing and approval, while Class I and II devices require substantially lower levels of
regulation.

Before a new contact lens can be sold commercially, CVI must
complete these steps: (1) compile data on its chemistry and toxicology, (2) determine its microbiological profile and (3) define the proposed manufacturing process. This data must be submitted to the FDA to support an application for an
Investigational Device Exemption. Once this is granted, clinical trials can begin. These are subject to review and approval by an Institutional Review Board and, where a lens is determined to have a significant risk, the FDA. After the clinical
trials are completed, a Premarket Approval Application must be submitted to and approved by the FDA.

In connection with some of Cooper’s new products, we can submit an expedited procedure known as a 510(k) application for premarket notification to the FDA. Any product that can demonstrate that it is
substantially equivalent to another device marketed before May 28, 1976, can use this procedure. If the new product is not substantially equivalent to a preexisting device or if the FDA rejects a claim of substantial equivalence, FDA marketing
clearance requires extensive preclinical and clinical testing, substantially increasing the cost and delaying the time to market.

FDA and state regulations also require the Company to adhere to applicable “good manufacturing practices” (GMP). They require detailed quality assurance and
record keeping and make periodic unscheduled regulatory inspections. The Company believes it is in compliance with GMP regulations.



Health authorities in foreign countries regulate Cooper’s clinical trials and medical device sales. The regulations
vary widely from country to country. Even if the FDA has approved a product, the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there.

These regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new
product development and marketing. Cooper cannot assure that all necessary approvals will be obtained, or obtained in a timely manner. If the Company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing,
product approval may be withdrawn.

All of Cooper’s currently marketed
products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies, and none are being marketed under an Investigative Device Exemption.

In addition to FDA regulatory requirements, the Company also maintains ISO 9000 certification and CE mark approvals for its products. A CE mark is an international symbol
of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable European medical device requirements. These quality programs and approvals are required by the European Medical Device Directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be
sold in the European market. In order to maintain these quality benchmarks, the Company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures.

RAW MATERIALS

CVI’s raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and packaging materials. There are alternative supply sources for each of them. Raw materials used by CSI
are generally available from more than one source. However, because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures, CSI could experience inventory shortages if it were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

In the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Brazil, Portugal, Italy, Spain, France,
Holland, Sweden, Norway, Australia and South Africa, CVI markets its products through its field sales representatives, who call on optometrists, ophthalmologists, opticians and optical chains. In the United States, field sales representatives also
call on distributors. In Japan and other countries outside North America, CVI uses distributors and has given most of them the exclusive right to market our products. In the United States, CVI augments its sales and marketing efforts with
e-commerce, telemarketing and advertising in professional journals.

CSI’s
products are marketed by a network of field sales representatives and distributors. In the United States, CSI augments its sales and marketing activities with e-commerce, telemarketing, direct mail and advertising in professional journals.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS

Cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents, which, in total, are
material to its overall business. The names of certain of Cooper’s products are protected by trademark registrations in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and, in some cases, also in foreign trademark offices. Applications are
pending for additional trademark registrations. Cooper aggressively defends its intellectual property rights.



No individual patent or license is material to the Company or either of its principal business units other than:

•

Our non-exclusive Patent License Agreement dated as of December 2, 1997, between Cooper and Geoffrey Galley, Albert Moreland, Barry Bevis and Ivor Atkinson entered into in
connection with the Company’s acquisition of Aspect Vision Care Limited (the Edge Patent License). This agreement expires in January 2010 and relates to patents used by CVI to produce a contact lens edge that provides superior comfort to the
wearer. The edge forms a part of CVI’s products (both spherical and toric lenses) that are manufactured using a cast molding technology in the Company’s Hamble, England, and Norfolk, Virginia, facilities.

•

Our license related to products manufactured by CVI using the proprietary phosphorylcholine (PC) technology patents that we received in connection with the Company’s
acquisition of Biocompatibles Eye Care, Inc. Our Proclear Compatibles

®

brand of spherical, multifocal and toric soft contact lenses are manufactured using this PC technology. This license term extends until the patents expire.

In addition to trademarks and patent licenses, the Company owns certain trade secrets,
copyrights, know-how and other intellectual property.

DEPENDENCE ON
CUSTOMERS

Neither of our business units depends to any material extent on
any one customer or any one affiliated group of customers.

GOVERNMENT
CONTRACTS

Neither of our business units is materially subject to profit
renegotiation or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the United States government.

BACKLOG

Backlog is not a material
factor in either of Cooper’s business units.

SEASONALITY

CVI’s contact lens sales in its first fiscal quarter, which runs
from November 1 through January 31, are typically lower than subsequent quarters, as patient traffic to practitioners’ offices is relatively light during the holiday season.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

Federal, state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or relate to the protection of the environment, do not currently
materially affect Cooper’s capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

WORKING CAPITAL

Cooper has not required any material working
capital arrangements in the past five years.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Note numbers refer to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” beginning on page 40 of this Form 10-K.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

In this section, we discuss the results of our operations for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 and the results of our operations for
fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “Capital Resources and
Liquidity.”

Highlights: Fiscal Year 2004 vs. Fiscal Year 2003

•

Net sales up 19% to $490.2 million.

•

Gross profit up 19%; gross margin, 64% of net sales.

•

Operating income up 23% to $116.8 million. Operating margin at 24% of net sales up by 1 percentage point.

•

Effective tax rate (provision for income taxes divided by income before income taxes) down to 17.5% from 24%.

•

Diluted earnings per share up 24% to $2.59 from $2.09.

Selected Statistical Information – Percentage of Net Sales and Growth

Net Sales

Cooper’s two business units, CooperVision (CVI) and CooperSurgical (CSI) generate all
its sales:

•

CVI markets, develops and manufactures a broad range of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market.

•

CSI markets medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians.

Our consolidated net sales grew by 19% in 2004 and 31% in 2003. Both CVI and CSI have
consistently achieved double-digit net sales growth over the three-year period driven by organic growth as well as acquisitions.

CVI Net Sales

Practitioner and patient preferences in the worldwide contact lens market continue to
change. The major shifts are from:

•

Conventional lenses replaced annually to disposable and frequently replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently
replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months.

•

Commodity lenses to specialty lenses including toric lenses, cosmetic lenses, multifocal lenses and lenses for patients experiencing the symptoms of dry eye syndrome.

•

Commodity spherical lenses to value-added spherical lenses such as lenses with aspherical optical properties.

These shifts favor CVI’s line of specialty products, which comprise over 62% of
CVI’s worldwide business and 70% of its revenue in the United States.

Definitions: Lens revenue consists of sales of spherical lenses, which include aspherically designed lenses and specialty lenses – toric, cosmetic, multifocal lenses and lenses for patients with dry eyes.

•

Aspheric lenses correct only for near- and farsightedness, but they have additional optical properties that help improve visual acuity in low light conditions and can correct low
levels of astigmatism and low levels of presbyopia, an age-related vision defect.

•

Toric lens designs correct astigmatism by adding the additional optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea.

•

Cosmetic lenses are opaque and color enhancing lenses that alter the natural appearance of the eye.

•

Multifocal lenses are designed to correct presbyopia.

•

Proclear

®

lenses help enhance tissue/device compatibility for patients experiencing mild discomfort relating to dry eyes during lens wear.

The primary reasons for CVI’s 2004 revenue growth include continued global market share gains during the year with disposable toric
revenue up 45%, total toric product revenue up 22% and disposable sphere revenue up 20%. CVI’s line of specialty lenses grew 23% during the year. Sales growth is driven primarily through increases in the volume of lenses sold as the market
continues to move to more frequent replacement including within rapidly growing specialty lenses. Sales increases also resulted from the global rollout of Proclear

®

toric and multifocal lenses which, respectively, increased 96% and 94% to $15.7 million and $11.4 million in the
twelve-month period. While unit



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

growth and product mix have influenced revenue growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced revenue growth.

Since the acquisition of Biocompatibles in fiscal 2002, CVI has actively marketed
Proclear

®

lenses. In many cases, practitioners now
recommend Proclear

®

lenses rather than older CVI
products.

CVI Net Sales

International sales grew 24% (12% in
constant currency) to $204 million in the year, led by sales of two-week and monthly sphere products, which grew $23.3 million, or 27%. Also, sales of two-week and monthly toric products grew 62%, or $20.9 million. International sales growth was
partially offset by declines in conventional spheres and torics of 17% and 16%, respectively.

Sales in the United States grew 12% in fiscal 2004, primarily due to sales of two-week and monthly toric products, which grew 32% to $56.3 million. Also, sales of the Biocompatibles product lines, especially the sales
of Proclear

®

specialty lenses, enhanced the revenue
growth.

CVI New Products and Markets

During 2004, CVI expanded its product offerings:

•

Two-week disposable toric lens to correct astigmatism introduced in Japan.

•

Proclear

®

disposable multifocal, a disposable product for wearers with both presbyopia, the blurring of vision that occurs with aging, and the symptoms of dry eye syndrome, introduced in European markets.

Outlook

We believe that CVI will continue to compete successfully in the worldwide contact lens
market with its disposable and frequently replaced lenses (DPR), toric lenses, aspheric lenses and newer specialty lenses including Proclear

®

products for lens wearers who experience mild dry eye discomfort, cosmetic lenses (both those that change and those that accentuate the eye’s
natural color) and multifocal lenses. In the U.S., market demographics are favorable, as the teenaged population, the age when most contact lens wear begins, is projected to grow considerably over the next two decades. The reported incidence of
myopia continues to increase worldwide. We expect greater market penetration in Europe and the Far East as practitioners increasingly prescribe more specialty lenses.

The acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc. (Ocular) brings a number of benefits to the Company.

•

The CVI and Ocular product lines are highly complementary. Ocular’s disposable spherical lenses, daily wear lenses and silicone hydrogel extended wear
technology augment CVI’s line of specialty



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

lenses, making the combined entity fully competitive in all major contact lens product categories in all major markets around the world.

•

In North America, the world’s largest contact lens market, Ocular’s strength in large retail optometric chain customers complements CVI’s strength on independent
professional optometric customers.

•

Ocular’s strong presence in Japan and the Asia Pacific region provides CVI with more rapid access to significant market share in the world’s second largest contact lens
market where CVI currently has a low market share.

•

Ocular’s European operations, especially their strong position in Germany, complement CVI’s strong British, French, Italian and Spanish businesses.

•

Ocular’s Gen II manufacturing process supports CVI’s CooperSync

™

programs targeted at lower cost lens manufacturing resulting, over time, in reduced production costs and improved gross margins.

We anticipate that CVI will continue its revenue growth at rates
faster than the anticipated constant currency market increase of 8% - 10%.

CSI Net Sales

Women’s healthcare products used primarily
in obstetricians’ and gynecologists’ practices generate about 90% of CSI’s revenue. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women’s healthcare where CSI does not actively market. In 2004, CSI’s sales increased
23% to $101.5 million, $19.3 million above 2003, primarily due to recent acquisitions. Organic growth of existing products was about 4%. While unit growth and product mix have influenced organic revenue growth, average realized prices by product
have not materially influenced such growth.

Results of operations of acquired
companies are included in our consolidated results beginning on the acquisition date. We discuss acquisitions completed in fiscal 2004 below. Acquisitions completed in fiscal 2003 are discussed under “2003 Compared with 2002” in the
“CSI Net Sales” section.

2004 CSI Acquisitions (See Note 2)

•

In December 2003, CSI announced the purchase from privately-held SURx, Inc., of the assets and associated worldwide license rights for the Laparoscopic (LP) and Transvaginal (TV)
product lines of its Radio Frequency (RF) Bladder Neck Suspension technology, which uses radio frequency based thermal energy instead of implants to restore continence.

•

In February 2004, Cooper acquired Milex Products, Inc., a manufacturer and marketer of obstetric and gynecologic products and customized print services. Milex is a leading supplier
of pessaries – products used to medically manage female urinary incontinence and pelvic support conditions – and also supplies cancer screening products, including endometrial and endocervical sampling devices and a breast biopsy needle
for fine needle aspiration. Milex also publishes patient education materials that discuss prenatal and pregnancy issues, breast health, menopause and osteoporosis.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

Demographics

Favorable demographic trends also support CSI’s business. The women of the “baby-boomer” generation are now reaching the age when gynecological procedures
are performed most frequently, and CSI has, through both acquisition and internal development, built an extensive product line to diagnose and treat these patients.

Outlook

We anticipate that CSI will continue to consolidate the women’s healthcare market. Fiscal 2005 revenue is expected to range from $115 million to $118 million.

During 2004, following the acquisition of Milex, CSI implemented an initiative
to expand its sales and marketing efforts in order to increase organic growth over the next several years. These programs will focus on CSI’s products in the incontinence, infertility and female sterilization markets using its restructured
sales force of independent and direct sales representatives.

Compared with 2002

CVI Net Sales

CVI’s worldwide sales grew 35% in fiscal 2003. CVI reported net sales include
Biocompatibles revenue beginning in March 2002. In the following table, we adjust CVI reported sales by adding Biocompatibles’ sales for the four-month period in fiscal 2002 that we did not own them (as shown on the Biocompatibles’
unaudited ledgers) to the year’s actual results. The total represents the lens business we now own.

Since the acquisition of Biocompatibles, CVI has actively marketed Proclear

®

lenses. In many cases, practitioners now recommend Proclear

®

lenses rather than older CVI products.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

CVI Net Sales

Total adjusted worldwide sales grew
23% (16% in constant currency) in 2003.

International sales grew 25% (12% in
constant currency) to $164.8 million in the year, led by sales of two-week and monthly sphere products, which grew $24.7 million, or 40%. Also, sales of two-week and monthly toric products grew 42% or $10 million.

Adjusted sales in the United States grew 20% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to sales of
two-week and monthly sphere products, which grew 33% to $14.4 million. Also, sales of two-week and monthly toric products grew 47% to $14 million. The acquisition of Biocompatibles product lines, especially the sales of Proclear

®

and other specialty lenses, enhanced the revenue
growth.

The primary reasons for the 2003 revenue growth were:

•

21% increase in toric lens sales.

•

Continued momentum in Europe with sales up 20%

•

Growth in disposable spheres up 37%.

CSI Net Sales

Women’s healthcare products used primarily by obstetricians and gynecologists generate about 90% of CSI’s sales. The balance are sales of medical devices outside of women’s healthcare where CSI does not
actively market. In 2003, CSI’s sales increased 15% to $82.2 million, $10.8 million above 2002, primarily due to acquisitions. The reported growth was slowed by declining sales in more mature product lines, softness in the equipment portion of
the market and a delay in replacing an in-vitro fertilization catheter that CSI could no longer market when an exclusive distributor relationship ended.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

2003 CSI Acquisitions (See Note 2)

•

In May, acquired Prism Enterprises, LP, which develops, manufacturers and markets medical devices and disposable products for the obstetric, neonatal and gynecological market.

•

In October, acquired Avalon Medical Corporation the United States distributor of the Filshie

®

Clip, a device used worldwide to perform female sterilization.

CVI’s gross margin for fiscal
2004, at 67%, was equal to 2003 and 2002. CVI manufactures about 66% of its lenses in the United Kingdom. The favorable impact of currency on revenue is offset by the unfavorable impact on manufacturing costs. In addition, we have lower gross margin
on sales to Asia-Pacific distributors, which increased 27%.

CSI’s gross
margin improved to 55% from 54% in 2003 as we completed the integration of acquisitions including Prism and Avalon.

CSI’s 2003 gross margin was 54% of net sales, up from 51% in 2002. CSI’s 2002 margin was 54% prior to the impact of a charge against cost of sales of about $2
million for the phase out of the Cerveillance

®

colposcopy system.

For fiscal 2005, absent the impact of future acquisitions,
we expect that CSI gross margins from recurring activities will improve as we complete integration of recent acquisitions and progress with the initiative to expand sales and marketing efforts targeted at organic growth.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SGA)

Consolidated SGA increased by 17% in
2004 and 29% in 2003, which support the increase in sales. As a percentage of net sales, consolidated SGA was 39% in fiscal 2004 and 40% in 2003 and 2002.

CVI’s SGA increased 16% in 2004 and 29% in 2003. SGA as a percentage of net sales improved to 38% in 2004 from 39% in 2003 on reductions of advertising and
distribution costs. However, selling, promotion and distribution costs to introduce new products continued in 2004.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

CSI’s 2004 SGA increased 35% over 2003, which support the 23% increase in sales. Selling and marketing costs
increased to support CSI’s initiative to increase organic growth. In 2003, SGA increased 16% over 2002.

Corporate headquarters’ SGA decreased to 2.2% of consolidated net sales from 2.9% in 2003 and 2.4% in 2002. Headquarters’ 2004 expenses decreased 9% to $10.7 million as expenses to maintain our global
trading arrangement declined. Headquarters’ 2003 expenses increased 58% over 2002 due to various projects associated with our global trading arrangement.

Research and Development Expense

Research and development expense was 1% of net sales in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002: $6.5 million in 2004, $5.6 million in 2003 and $4.3 million in 2002.

CVI continues to invest in two research programs: the development of an extended wear contact
lens and an improved contact lens technology. Most of our R&D expense, other than the two programs, is for clinical, regulatory and other product development activities and not for basic research.

Amortization of Intangibles

Amortization of intangibles was $2.1 million in 2004 and $1.5 million in 2003 and 2002.
Amortization expense increased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to acquired intangible assets.

Operating Income

Operating income grew
$49.8 million or 74% between 2002 and 2004:

Gain on Sale of Quidel Stock

In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, we sold 339,725, 250,000 and 592,000 shares of Quidel stock, and realized gains of approximately $1.4
million, $621,000 and $1.2 million, respectively (see Note 7).

Gain on
Litmus/Quidel Transaction

In the first quarter of 2001, Quidel
Corporation (Quidel) acquired Litmus Concepts, Inc. (Litmus) through an exchange of common stock. Cooper held a preferred equity position in Litmus, which equated to approximately a 10 percent ownership. As a result of this transaction, we received
1,138,725 shares of Quidel’s common stock. In the third quarter of 2002, we received an additional 334,727 shares of Quidel that were held in escrow and recorded a gain of $2.1 million, based on the fair market value of Quidel shares on the day
we received them.

Foreign Exchange

In 2004, the pound strengthened against the dollar, resulting in a net gain of about
$69,000. We have taken steps to minimize this exposure. Our policy continues to be to hedge foreign exchange exposure whenever possible.

In 2003, the pound strengthened against the dollar, resulting in a net gain of about $1.8 million. When we acquired Biocompatibles, we inherited intercompany accounts in
various currencies, primarily pounds sterling.

In 2002, the acquisition of
Biocompatibles and additional capitalization for international operations provided about $21 million in pounds sterling to a U.K. affiliate for short-term financing. While the loans were outstanding, the pound strengthened against the dollar, and a
net gain of about $1.5 million resulted when the loan was repaid. Additional gains of $300,000 resulted from currency exposures that were acquired and not hedged.

Settlement of Dispute

In 2004, we paid $377,000 to settle a legal dispute, and in 2003 we paid a one-time fee of $500,000 to settle a legal dispute.

Interest Expense

Interest expense was $6 million in 2004, $7 million in 2003 and $6.9 million in 2002. Interest expense decreased in 2004, reflecting a
general decrease in interest rates and reduced debt levels due to strong operating cash flow.

Provision for Income Taxes

Our
effective tax rate (ETR) for fiscal 2004 was 17.5% down from fiscal 2003’s effective tax rate (ETR) of 24% and fiscal 2002’s ETR of 25%. The reduction of our ETR resulted from a greater percent of our income being taxed at rates
substantially lower than the U.S. statutory rate. We expect our ETR to be 21% for fiscal 2005.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

With anticipated faster growth outside the U.S. and a favorable mix of products manufactured outside the U.S., Cooper
now expects that its net operating loss carryforwards (NOLs) in the U.S. will last through 2007.

We implemented a global trading arrangement in fiscal 1999 to minimize both the taxes reported in our statement of income and the actual taxes we will have to pay when we use all the benefits of our NOLs. The global
trading arrangement consisted of a restructuring of legal ownership for the CooperVision foreign sales and manufacturing subsidiaries.

The stock of those subsidiaries is now owned by a single foreign holding company, which centrally directs much of the activities of those subsidiaries. The foreign
holding company has applied for and received the benefits of a reduced tax rate under a special tax regime available in its country of domicile. Assuming no other major acquisitions or large stock issuance, we currently expect that this plan will
extend the cash flow benefits of the existing NOLs through 2007, and that actual cash payments of taxes will average less than 5% of pretax profits over this period. After 2007, actual cash payments of taxes are expected to average less than 20% of
pretax profits.

CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY

Year 2004 Highlights

•

Operating cash flow up 27% to $101.2 million vs. $79.6 million in 2003.

•

Completed four acquisitions and paid other acquisition costs totaling $63.9 million.

•

Expenditures for purchases of property, plant and equipment $40.5 million vs. $33.9 million in 2003.

Comparative Statistics

Operating Cash Flows

Cash flow provided from operating activities continues as Cooper’s
major source of liquidity, totaling $101.2 million in fiscal 2004 and $79.6 million in 2003.

Major uses of cash for operating activities included payments of $3.5 million for income taxes, $5.4 million in interest payments, $3 million final payment on a previously accrued dispute settlement



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

with Medical Engineering Corporation, a subsidiary of Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, pursuant to a 1993 settlement agreement and $3.1 million to fund 2003
entitlements under Cooper’s bonus plans.

Working capital increased $39.2
million in fiscal 2004, as cash decreased $8 million, primarily to fund acquisitions, marketable securities decreased $3.9 million from sales of securities and the decline of the market value of securities available for sale, current accrued
liabilities and accounts payable increased $900,000, and short-term debt increased $200,000, partially offset by increases of $17.9 million in inventory, $14.6 million in receivables and $19.7 million in current deferred tax assets and other. The
increase in inventory is due to the growth in the overall business, planned inventory increases to improve service levels, acquisitions and the effect of foreign exchange. The increase in receivables is primarily due to the increase in sales.

At the end of fiscal 2004, Cooper’s inventory months on hand was 6.9
versus 7.0 at fiscal year end 2003. Cooper continued to improve its receivable collections with days of sales outstanding (DSO’s) at the end of the current year declining to 65 days from 67 days at October 31, 2003. Looking forward, we expect
DSO’s in the mid to upper 60’s to low 70’s given continued strong growth expectations outside the United States where DSO’s are higher. Based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried
products and product levels, we believe that our accounts receivable and inventories are recoverable.

Investing Cash Flows

The cash outflow
of $100.6 million for investing activities was driven by payments of $63.9 million on acquisitions and capital expenditures of $40.5 million used primarily to expand manufacturing capacity and the continued rollout of new information systems. The
cash outflow was partially offset by $3.8 million of cash received from the sale of marketable securities.

Financing Cash Flows

The cash outflow
of $8.7 million from financing activities was driven by net repayment of debt of about $20.5 million and dividends paid on our common stock of $1.9 million offset by $13.7 million from the exercise of stock options.

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

None.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

As of October 31, 2004, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial
commitments:

The expected future benefit payments
for pension plans for years one through ten are disclosed in Note 10, “Employee Benefits.”

Risk Management (See Note 1)

Most of
our operations outside of the United States have their reporting currency as their functional currency. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange principally on balances denominated in other than the locations’ functional
currency. We have taken steps to minimize our balance sheet exposure. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rate on each of our revolving credit agreement and term loan debt varies with the London
Interbank Offered Rate. We have decreased this risk by issuing fixed rate debt in the form of 2.625% convertible debentures.

Outlook

We believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand of $39.4 million plus cash from operating activities will fund future operations, capital expenditures, cash dividends and smaller acquisitions. At October 31,
2004, we had $143.1 million available under the KeyBank line of credit.

See
Note 13, “Subsequent Events” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for the effect of the January 6, 2005, acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc.

Inflation and Changing Prices

Inflation had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three years.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ratified the consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) with respect to Issue No. 04-8, “The
Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share.” The EITF’s consensus states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible securities should be included in



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

computations of diluted earnings per share (if dilutive) regardless of whether their market price triggers (or other contingent features) have been met.
Additionally, in its efforts to converge with international accounting standards, the FASB has issued an Exposure Draft, “Earnings Per Share – an amendment of FASB Statement No. 128.” This Exposure Draft states that contingent
convertible securities which contain an option to settle in cash or stock be assumed to settle in stock for purposes of computing diluted earnings per share.

Cooper currently has $115 million of outstanding contingently convertible senior debentures (Debentures) due on July 1, 2023. The Debentures are convertible into 22.5201
shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures or approximately 2.6 million shares. In our fiscal fourth quarter 2004, the debentures became convertible as our share price exceeded 120% of the conversion price for 20
consecutive trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last trading day of the quarter ended July 31, 2004. However, prior to July 1, 2008, we may not redeem at our option nor may a holder require us to repurchase any
outstanding debentures.

During the fourth fiscal quarter 2004, the Company
elected to adopt the provisions of EITF Issue No. 04-8 and as a result included the dilutive effect of the debentures in its diluted earnings per share calculation from the time of issuance of the debentures – our fiscal third quarter
2003, in accordance with the if-converted methodology under FASB Statement No. 128. Accordingly, prior period diluted EPS has been restated (see Note 4).

In December 2004, FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (Statement 123(R)). It requires that the compensation cost relating
to share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements and that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. Statement 123(R) replaces FASB Statement No. 123, “Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation,” and supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” in effect removing the option, stated in FASB No. 123, to apply the guidance in Opinion 25. This statement is effective as
the beginning of the first reporting period that begins after June 15, 2005, or our fourth fiscal quarter 2005. Transition may be accomplished using the modified prospective application or the modified retrospective application.

Cooper currently measures compensation costs related to share-based payments under Opinion
25, as allowed by FASB No. 123. This will affect both our net income and earning per share as determined by the transition methodology in Statement 123(R).

Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies

Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of Management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an
accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however,
actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods.

•

Revenue recognition – We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement
exists, delivery has occurred, the seller’s price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For contact lenses as well as CooperSurgical medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories,
this primarily occurs upon product shipment, when risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We
record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and
specifically established customer product return programs. While estimates are involved, historically, most of these programs have not been major factors in our business, since a high percentage of our revenue is from direct sales to doctors.

•

Allowance for doubtful accounts – Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the amount that ultimately
will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers. When our analyses indicate, we
increase or decrease our allowance accordingly. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor
given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment patterns and the fact that patients require satisfaction of healthcare needs in both strong and weak economics.

•

Net realizable value of inventory – In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues
potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of
salability, and reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy
product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, about seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels.

•

Valuation of goodwill – We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” We no longer amortize goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that
impairment may exist. We performed an impairment test in our third fiscal quarter 2004, and our analysis indicated that we have no goodwill impairment.

The FASB Statement No. 142 goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net
assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to them. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. When available and as
appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value results. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment.



Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

Our reporting units are the same as our business segments – CooperVision and CooperSurgical
– reflecting the way that we manage our business. Our most recent estimate of fair value, at the time of our May 1, 2004, review and using several valuation techniques including assessing industry multiples, for CooperVision ranged from $1
billion to $1.6 billion compared to a carrying value of $438 million and for CooperSurgical fair value ranged from $317 million to $461 million compared to a carrying value of $167 million.

•

Business combinations – We routinely consummate business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of
net assets purchased, acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill. On individually significant acquisitions, we utilize independent valuation experts to provide a basis in order to refine the purchase price allocation, if
appropriate. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

•

Income taxes – As part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate a portion of our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in
which we operate. This process requires significant Management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the
recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. The Company currently has $42.9 million
of deferred tax assets that primarily represent the future benefit of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, which expire between 2006 and 2020. To the extent these net operating losses are not used timely by future profits, a valuation allowance or
write-off could result. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates. We are required to estimate full-year income and the
related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We adjust the estimated effective tax rate for the tax related to significant unusual items. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective
tax rate, and such changes could be material.



Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk.

The Company is exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company’s policy is to minimize,
to the extent reasonable and practical, its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts, respectively. The Company does not
enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. Additional information for this item is incorporated by reference to “Derivatives” in Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” and in
Note 7 “Financial Instruments” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”

Long-term Debt

Total debt decreased to $165.7 million at October 31, 2004, from $185.9 million at October 31, 2003. Long-term debt includes $115 million of convertible senior debentures
(see “Convertible Senior Debentures” in Note 6 “Debt”) issued in fiscal year 2003, and the proceeds were used to reduce amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility and for additional funding requirements.

As of October 31, 2004, the scheduled
maturities of the Company’s fixed and variable rate long-term debt obligations (excluding capitalized leases), their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows:

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

The Cooper Companies, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Cooper Companies, Inc.
and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and comprehensive income for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2004. These consolidated financial statements
are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements
referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Cooper Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the
three-year period ended October 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

The Cooper Companies, Inc. (the “Company,” “Cooper,” “we” and similar pronouns), through its principal
business units, markets, develops and manufactures healthcare products. CooperVision (CVI) markets, develops and manufactures a broad range of contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market. It specializes in toric lenses that correct
astigmatism, cosmetic lenses that change the appearance of the color of the eye, and other lenses, primarily high growth, specialty and value-added market segments around the world. Its leading products are disposable and planned replacement toric
and spherical lenses. CooperSurgical (CSI) markets, develops and manufactures medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians.

Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies

Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial statements prepared in
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of Management when preparing
our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We believe that the accounting
estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified
to conform to current period’s presentation.

•

Revenue recognition – We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement
exists, delivery has occurred, the seller’s price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. For contact lenses as well as CooperSurgical medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories,
this primarily occurs upon product shipment, when risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We
record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and
specifically established customer product return programs. While estimates are involved, historically, most of these programs have not been major factors in our business, since a high percentage of our revenue is from direct sales to doctors.

•

Allowance for doubtful accounts – Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate of the
amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual customers. When our
analyses indicate, we increase or decrease our allowance accordingly. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been
a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

patterns and the fact that patients require satisfaction of healthcare needs in both strong and weak economics.

•

Net realizable value of inventory – In assessing the value of inventories, we must make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and other relevant issues
potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other indications of
salability, and reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy
product life cycles. We target to keep, on average, about seven months of inventory on hand, to maintain high customer service levels.

•

Valuation of goodwill – We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.” We no longer amortize goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that
impairment may exist. We performed an impairment test in our third fiscal quarter 2004, and our analysis indicated that we have no goodwill impairment.

The FASB Statement No. 142 goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net
assets to the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill assigned to them. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. When available and as
appropriate, we use comparative market multiples to corroborate fair value results. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for impairment.

Our reporting units are the same as our business segments – CooperVision and CooperSurgical – reflecting the way
that we manage our business. Our most recent estimate of fair value, at the time of our May 1, 2004, review and using several valuation techniques including assessing industry multiples, for CooperVision ranged from $1 billion to $1.6 billion
compared to a carrying value of $438 million and for CooperSurgical fair value ranged from $317 million to $461 million compared to a carrying value of $167 million.

•

Business combinations – We routinely consummate business combinations. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions based on our estimates and judgments of the fair value of
net assets purchased, acquisition costs incurred and intangibles other than goodwill. On individually significant acquisitions, we utilize independent valuation experts to provide a basis in order to refine the purchase price allocation, if
appropriate. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition.

jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant Management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as
well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. The Company currently
has $42.9 million of

deferred tax assets that primarily represent the future benefit of U.S. net operating loss carryforwards, which expire between 2006 and 2020. To the extent
these net operating losses are not used timely by future profits, a valuation allowance or write-off could result. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each
jurisdiction complicate future estimates. We are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We adjust the estimated effective tax rate for the tax related to significant unusual items. Changes in
the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material.

Consolidation

The financial statements in this report include the accounts of all of Cooper’s consolidated entities. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

Foreign Currency Translation

Most of our operations outside the United States have their reporting currency as their
functional currency. We translate these assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. We translate income and expense accounts at weighted average rates for each year. We record gains and losses from the translation of
financial statements in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars in other comprehensive income. We record gains and losses from changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than each reporting location’s functional
currency in net income for each period. Net foreign exchange gains included in the determination of net income for the years ended October 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were $69,000, $1.8 million and $1.8 million, respectively.

Derivatives

We use derivatives to reduce market risks associated with changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. We do not use derivatives for
trading or speculative purposes. We believe that the counterparty with which we enter into forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements is financially sound and that the credit risk of these contracts is negligible.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include commercial paper and other short-term income producing
securities with maturity dates of three months or less. These investments are readily convertible to cash and are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

Inventories, at the Lower of Average Cost or Market



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

Property, Plant and Equipment

We compute depreciation using the
straight-line method in amounts sufficient to write off depreciable assets over their estimated useful lives. We amortize leasehold improvements over their estimated useful lives or the period of the related lease, whichever is shorter. We
depreciate buildings over 35 to 40 years and machinery and equipment over 3 to 15 years.

We expense costs for maintenance and repairs and capitalize major replacements, renewals and betterments. We eliminate the cost and accumulated depreciation of depreciable assets retired or otherwise disposed of from
the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts and reflect any gains or losses in operations for the period.

Earnings Per Share

We determine basic
earnings per share (EPS) by using the weighted average number of shares outstanding. We determine diluted EPS by increasing the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the denominator by the number of outstanding dilutive stock options and,
in accordance with the if-converted method, the number of shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to the debentures. In addition, the numerator is adjusted to add back the after-tax amount of interest recognized in the period
associated with the debentures (see Note 4).

Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with FASB Statement
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” as amended by FASB Statement No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and Disclosure, an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123.” These statements
establish financial accounting and reporting standards for stock-based compensation, including employee stock option plans.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

As allowed by FASB Statement No. 123, we continue to measure compensation expense under Accounting Principles Board
(APB) Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,” and related interpretations (see Note 9). Accordingly, no compensation cost has been recognized for our employee stock option plans. Had compensation cost for our
stock-based compensation plans been determined under the fair value method included in FASB Statement No. 123, as amended by FASB Statement No. 148, our net income and earnings per share would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated
below.

(1)

As discussed in Note 4 to the audited financial statements, the Company has restated its
diluted earnings per share beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2003 to reflect the accounting change for contingently convertible debentures.

The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions used
for grants in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002: dividend yield: 0.120%, 0.215% and 0.417%; expected volatility: 28%, 37% and 55%; expected option lives of 3.5 years for all three years and risk-free interest rates of 3.0%, 2.6% and 3.0%, respectively.

Note 2. Acquisitions

All acquisitions disclosed here have been accounted for as purchases. Accordingly, results
of operations for acquired companies are included in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. The Company is in the process of obtaining a third party valuation of the fair value of identifiable assets of Opti-Centre and
Milex; thus, the allocation for the purchase price is subject to refinement. All acquisitions are made to further the business objectives of CVI or CSI:

•

CVI: To continue to grow revenue at one and one-half times the rate of the world market and to become the world’s largest specialty contact lens provider by mid-decade.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

•

CSI: To identify and acquire selected smaller companies and product lines that can improve its existing market position in women’s healthcare or offer opportunities in new
clinical areas.

Acquisition of Opti-Centre

On March 31, 2004, CVI acquired all the outstanding shares and certain patents of Les
Laboratories Opti-Centre Inc. (Opti-Centre), a Quebec-based contact lens manufacturer, which holds the patents covering CooperVision’s multifocal lens design technology used in its Frequency

®

and Proclear

®

multifocal products.

We paid $11.6 million in cash for Opti-Centre. Initially, we have ascribed $1.7 million to goodwill, $10.2 million to other intangibles, $400,000 to property, plant and
equipment and a negative $500,000 to a working capital deficit (including acquisition costs of $300,000). The allocation for the purchase price is subject to refinement as we are currently obtaining a third party valuation of the business.

Acquisition of Argus

On February 23, 2004, CVI acquired from privately owned Argus Biomedical Pty Ltd the assets
related to AlphaCor

®

, an artificial cornea, and
AlphaSphere

®

, a soft orbital implant.

We paid $2.1 million in cash for Argus with future royalties payable on AlphaCor

®

sales. Initially, we have ascribed $2.5 million to
goodwill, a negative $300,000 to a working capital deficit (including acquisition costs of $400,000) and $100,000 to property, plant and equipment.

A new ophthalmic surgery business unit, CooperVision Surgical, will develop and market the Argus products to corneal surgeons.

Acquisition of Milex

On February 2, 2004, CSI acquired Milex Products, Inc. (Milex), a manufacturer and marketer of obstetric and gynecologic products and
customized print services for $26 million in cash and assumed $2.5 million of long-term debt. The debt was repaid immediately after the acquisition.

We have ascribed $23.5 million to goodwill, $3.6 million to property, plant and equipment, $800,000 to other intangibles, a negative $3.2 million to a working capital
deficit (including acquisition costs of $3.8 million), and $1.3 million to deferred tax assets. The allocation for the purchase price is subject to refinement as we are currently obtaining a third party valuation.

Milex is a leading supplier of pessaries – products used to medically manage female
urinary incontinence and pelvic support conditions – cancer screening products including endometrial and endocervical sampling devices, and patient education materials tailored to individual physician preferences.

Acquisition of SURx

On November 26, 2003, CSI purchased from privately-held SURx, Inc., the assets and associated worldwide license rights for the Laparoscopic
(LP) and Transvaginal (TV) product lines of its Radio



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

Frequency Bladder Neck Suspension technology, which uses radio frequency based thermal energy rather than implants to restore continence.

We paid $2.95 million in cash for SURx whose technology received U.S. Food and Drug
Administration marketing clearance in 2002. In 2004, based on a third party valuation of the fair value of identifiable assets, we reascribed $2.9 million to goodwill, a negative $163,000 to a working capital deficit (including net acquisition costs
of $489,000), $73,000 to other intangibles and $77,000 to property, plant and equipment.

Acquisition of Avalon Medical Corporation

On October 28, 2003, CSI acquired Avalon Medical Corporation (Avalon), the United States distributor of the Filshie

®

Clip System, a device used worldwide to perform female sterilization.

We paid $10 million in cash at closing for Avalon. In October 2004, based on a third party valuation of the fair value of identifiable
assets, we reascribed $2.3 million to goodwill, a negative $200,000 to a working capital deficit (including acquisition costs of $705,000), $8.2 million to other intangibles and $44,000 to property, plant and equipment.

U.K.-based FemCare Limited, manufacturer of the Filshie

®

Clip, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearance to market the device in May
1996. CSI has successfully negotiated a long-term supply agreement with FemCare for the U.S. market.

Acquisition of Prism Enterprises, LP

On May 5, 2003, CSI acquired privately-held Prism Enterprises, LP. Prism develops, manufactures and markets medical devices and other disposable products for the obstetric, neonatal and gynecological markets.

We paid about $23 million for Prism. In 2004, based on a third party valuation of the fair
value of identifiable assets, we reascribed $20.9 million to goodwill, $800,000 to working capital (including net acquisition costs of $600,000), $1 million to other intangible assets and $300,000 to property, plant and equipment.

Disposable products accounted for virtually all of Prism’s 2002 revenue. In 2002,
disposable vacuum assisted delivery (VAD) systems accounted for about 60% of Prism’s revenue, and its disposable obstetric, neonatal and gynecological products made up the remainder.

Acquisition of Biocompatibles

On February 28, 2002, CVI acquired the contact lens business of Biocompatibles International plc. (Biocompatibles), comprised of its wholly owned subsidiaries Hydron
Limited (Hydron), Biocompatibles Eye Care Inc. (BE Inc.) and Biocompatibles Canada Inc. (BE Canada). Under an International Share Sale Agreement (the “Sale Agreement”) dated January 15, 2002, among Biocompatibles, Cooper and Cooper’s
wholly owned subsidiary Aspect Vision Holdings Limited (AVH), Biocompatibles sold all of the outstanding shares of Hydron to AVH and all of the outstanding shares of BE Inc. and BE Canada to Cooper.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

Biocompatibles had worldwide revenue in calendar 2001 of about $70 million, with about 70% outside of North America.
Biocompatibles products were manufactured in Norfolk, Virginia; Farnborough, United Kingdom; Adelaide, Australia and Madrid, Spain.

The aggregate consideration paid for the shares and to repay outstanding indebtedness of the acquired business was £70

million (about $99 million) plus
transaction costs. In the purchase price allocation, $84.4 million has been ascribed to goodwill, and other intangible assets of $1.1 million are being amortized over eight years. The purchase price allocation also included $26.5 million of working
capital, $25 million of accrued acquisition costs and $11.7 million of property, plant and equipment.

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated condensed results of operations for fiscal year ended October 31, 2002, is presented as if Biocompatibles had been acquired on November 1, 2001. The unaudited pro forma
information is not indicative of either the results of operations that would have occurred if Biocompatibles had been purchased on November 1, 2001, or of future results of the combined operations. Pro forma net income does not include goodwill
amortization expense in any period. We used a 27% effective tax rate for the period.

Acquisition of Ackrad Laboratories

On May 21, 2002, CSI acquired privately-held Ackrad Laboratories, Inc.,
(Ackrad) a developer and manufacturer of disposable medical devices used primarily in the assessment of infertility and other gynecologic disorders.

We paid $12 million at closing for Ackrad. The purchase price allocation ascribed $11.9 million to goodwill, a negative $1.1 million to working capital (including accrued
acquisition costs of $2.4 million), $442,000 to net property, plant and equipment and $847,000 to deferred tax assets.

Ackrad’s principal product is the H/S Elliptosphere

™

Catheter, used in hysterosalpingography and saline contrast hysterosonography, the noninvasive assessment of the female reproductive anatomy. It is
used primarily for fertility studies, and also to assess abnormal uterine bleeding and pelvic pain.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Acquisition of Norland Medical Systems

On April 15, 2002, CSI acquired the assets of the bone densitometry business of Norland Medical Systems (Norland). Norland’s
densitometry products are used in the evaluation of osteoporosis.

We paid $5
million for Norland. The purchase price allocation ascribed $6.4 million to goodwill, a negative $2.2 million to a working capital deficit (including accrued acquisition costs of $1.6 million), $200,000 to property, plant and equipment and $600,000
to deferred tax assets.

Accrued Acquisition Costs

When we record acquisitions, we accrue for the estimated direct costs in accordance with
applicable accounting guidance including EITF Issue No. 95-3, “Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase Business Combination” of severance and plant/office closure costs of the acquired business. Management with the
appropriate level of authority have completed their assessment of exit activities of the acquired companies and have substantially completed their plans. In addition, we also accrue for costs directly associated with acquisitions, including legal,
consulting, deferred payments and due diligence. No material change in total accrued acquisition costs are anticipated for businesses acquired through October 31, 2004. There were no adjustments of accrued acquisition costs included in the
determination of net income for the periods. Beginning balances reflect a $2.4 million reclassification within the Biocompatibles acquisition accrual to increase the accrual for plant shutdown and decrease the accrual for severance. This
reclassification is necessary to reascribe costs, based on information acquired during the current fiscal year, under our single worldwide reorganization plan. Below is a summary of activity related to accrued acquisition costs for the twelve months
ended October 31, 2004.

Note 3. Intangible Assets

Primarily translation differences in goodwill denominated in foreign currency.

Of the October 31, 2004, goodwill balance, $68 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

Estimated annual amortization expense
is about $2.4 million for each of the years in the five-year period ending October 31, 2009.

Note 4. Earnings Per Share

In this
Annual Report, the Company has restated its diluted EPS beginning in the third fiscal quarter of 2003 to reflect the adoption of EITF Issue No. 04-8, which states that shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to contingent convertible
securities should be included in computations of diluted EPS (if dilutive) from the time of issuance, in accordance with the if-converted methodology under FASB Statement No. 128. Restated fiscal year 2003 diluted EPS is $2.09 versus $2.13
previously reported (see “Convertible Senior Debentures” in Note 6).



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

We excluded the following options to purchase Cooper’s common stock from the computation of diluted EPS because
their exercise prices were above the average market price.

Note 5. Income Taxes

Cooper’s effective tax rate (ETR) for fiscal 2004 (provision for
taxes divided by income before taxes) is 17.5% down from the 21% reported in its third quarter results. GAAP requires the projected fiscal year ETR to be used when reporting year-to-date results for interim periods. The reduction of our ETR in the
fourth quarter resulted from a greater percent of our income being taxed at rates substantially lower than the U.S. statutory rates, reinvestment of earnings from the continuing growth of CVI business outside the United States and the release of
certain tax reserves no longer required. The effect of the lower fiscal year ETR was to reduce the ETR for the fourth quarter to 8%.

The components of income before income taxes and the income tax provision related to income from all operations in the consolidated statements of income consist of:

The income tax provision related to
income in the consolidated statements of income consists of:

We reconcile the provision for income taxes attributable to income from operations and the amount computed by
applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income before income taxes as follows:

The tax effects of temporary
differences that give rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities are:

Cooper has provided a valuation
allowance on those deferred tax assets that it believes will not, more likely than not, be realized. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the years ended October 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 were decreases of $1.8 million, $507,000
and $745,000, respectively; a portion of those decreases relate to concurrent reductions in the deferred tax asset.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

The Company has not provided federal income tax on approximately $193.3 million of undistributed earnings of its
foreign subsidiaries since the Company intends to reinvest this amount outside the U.S. indefinitely.

At October 31, 2004, Cooper had net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards for federal tax purposes that expire as follows:

Note 6. Debt



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

Our long-term debt matures as follows over the next five years, excluding the potential repurchase of convertible
debentures in 2008:

Convertible Senior Debentures

In the third quarter of 2003, we issued $115 million of 2.625%
convertible senior debentures (Debentures) due on July 1, 2023, in a private placement pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933. The Debentures are convertible at the holder’s option under certain circumstances into
22.5201 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Debentures, approximately $44.40 per share, or approximately 2.6 million shares. When converted, we have the right to deliver, in lieu of shares of our common stock, cash or a
combination of cash and shares of common stock. The Debentures rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and are effectively subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our
subsidiaries, including trade creditors. We may redeem the Debentures (in whole or in part) for cash on or after July 1, 2008, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount. Holders may require us to repurchase the Debentures on July 1, 2008,
2013 and 2018, at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount.

The proceeds of $112.2 million reflect the discount of $2.8 million that we amortize over the life of the Debentures. The $1.2 million cost of issuing the Debentures is carried in other assets and amortized to interest expense over its
life.

We used the proceeds primarily to reduce amounts drawn under our
revolving credit facility and to fund acquisitions, with the remaining held for general corporate purposes.

In our fourth fiscal quarter 2004, the Debentures became convertible as our share price exceeded 120% of the conversion price for 20 consecutive trading days in the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on the last
trading day of the quarter ended July 31, 2004. However, prior to July 1, 2008, we may not redeem at our option nor may a holder require us to repurchase any outstanding debentures.

As described in Note 4, “Earnings Per Share,” the Company elected to adopt EITF Issue No. 04-8 and as a result included the
dilutive effect of the Debentures in its diluted earnings per share calculation from the time of issuance of the Debentures – our fiscal third quarter 2003, in accordance with the if-converted methodology under FASB Statement No. 128.

KeyBank Line of Credit

– See Note 13, “Subsequent
Events”

On May 1, 2002, Cooper obtained a $225 million syndicated bank
credit facility. The facility consists of a $75 million five-year term loan with an interest only payment in the first year then fully amortized



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

in the next four years, and a $150 million three-year revolving credit facility. KeyBank National Association (KeyBank) is the agent for the eleven-bank
syndication.

On July 31, 2003, the facility was amended to relax certain
restrictions and extend the revolving credit facility maturity to April 30, 2007 from April 30, 2005.

Interest rates under the facility are based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus additional basis points determined by Cooper’s ratio of debt to its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA). These range from 125 to 225 basis points for the term loan and from 100 to 200 basis points for the revolver. As of October 31, 2004, the additional basis points were 150 on the term loan and 125 on the revolver. At the
Company’s option, it can choose to pay a base rate that is within a range above the prime rate.

Terms include a first security interest in all Cooper domestic assets. The credit agreement:

•

Limits Cooper’s debt to a maximum of 50% of its total capitalization, which is defined as the sum of total debt plus stockholders’ equity.

•

Limits cash dividends on our common stock to $5 million per fiscal year.

•

Requires that the ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges (as defined in the agreement) be at least 1.3 to 1.

•

Requires that the ratio of total debt to pro forma EBITDA (as defined) be no higher than 2.75 to 1 through January 30, 2003, 2.5 to 1 January 31 through July 30, 2003 and 3 to 1
thereafter.

At October 31, 2004, Cooper’s debt was 23% of
total capitalization, its ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges (as defined) was 1.8 to 1 and its ratio of debt to EBITDA was 1.24 to 1.

The $3 million cost of acquiring the new credit facility is carried in other assets and amortized to interest expense over its life.

At October 31, 2004, we had $143.1 million available under the KeyBank line of credit:

*

Includes $3.9 million in letters of credit backing other debt.

Capitalized Leases

The obligation under capitalized leases at October 31, 2004, was $1.4 million. The leases primarily relate to manufacturing equipment in the U.S. and the United Kingdom and are secured by those assets. They carry
interest rates from 7% to 9% and mature between 2005 and 2006.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

COMIDA Bond

The COMIDA bond is a $3 million Industrial Revenue Bond (IRB) to finance the cost of plant expansion, building improvements and the purchase of equipment related to
CVI’s Scottsville, New York, facility. The interest rate has been effectively fixed at 4.88% through a rate swap transaction (see Note 7). Principal is repaid quarterly, from July 1997 to October 2012. The IRB is secured by substantially all of
CVI’s rights to the facility.

KeyBank issued a letter of credit to
support certain obligations under the COMIDA bond. CVI is obligated to repay KeyBank for draws under and expenses incurred in connection with the letter of credit, under a reimbursement agreement, which Cooper guarantees. The agreement contains
customary provisions and covenants, including certain required ratios and levels of net worth. CVI and COMIDA have granted a mortgage lien on the building and real estate located in Scottsville and a first lien security interest on the equipment
purchased under the bond proceeds to KeyBank to secure payment under the reimbursement agreement.

Note 7. Financial Instruments

The fair
value of each of our financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, lines of credit and accounts payable, approximated its carrying value as of October 31, 2004 and 2003 because of the short maturity of these
instruments and the ability to obtain financing on similar terms. We believe that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk in trade receivables.

The 2.625% convertible senior debentures are traded occasionally in public markets. The carrying value and estimated fair value of these obligations as of October 31,
2004, are $112.3 million and $194 million, respectively. The fair value of our other long-term debt approximated the carrying value at October 31, 2004 and 2003 because we believe that we could obtain similar financing with similar terms.

Marketable securities represent Quidel Corporation common stock available for
sale at fair value at each year-end. We received Quidel shares as a result of a transaction involving Litmus Concepts, Inc., in 2001 and additional shares upon release of escrow in 2002.

We have sold shares of Quidel stock from time to time:

Derivatives

Cooper entered into an interest rate swap agreement to reduce the potential negative impact of increases in interest rates on our outstanding variable-rate debt under the
IRB. We recognize in our results of operations over the life of the contract, as interest expense, the amortization of contract premiums incurred from buying the interest rate swap. We record net payments or receipts resulting from the agreement as
adjustments to interest expense. The effect of interest rate instruments on our results of operations in fiscal years ended October 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was not significant. As of October 31, 2004, the interest rate swap agreement had a notional
amount totaling $1.4 million that matures on January 1, 2012.

We obtained the
fair value of the swap agreement through KeyBank’s derivative department. The fair value indicated that termination of the swap agreement at October 31, 2004 would have resulted in a $88,000 loss. A liability for this amount has been accrued in
other current liabilities. As this swap agreement qualifies as an effective hedge, change in fair value during 2004 of $41,000 has been recorded as a component of other comprehensive income.

Note 8. Stockholders’ Equity

Following is a summary, excluding comprehensive income, of items included in stockholders’ equity:

Cash Dividends

Cooper paid quarterly dividends of 1 cent per share beginning July 5, 1999 through January
5, 2001. In the first quarter of fiscal 2001, Cooper increased its dividend and paid semiannual dividends of 2.5 cents per share beginning July 5, 2001. In November 2002, Cooper’s Board of Directors increased the annual dividend rate from 5
cents per share to 6 cents per share. See Note 13, “Subsequent Events,” regarding cash dividend declared and paid.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

Treasury Stock

(1)

Issued 11,000 shares of treasury stock upon the exercise of stock options and issuance of
restricted shares. Treasury stock was credited for $169,000 for the average cost of the treasury stock, and $164,000 was charged to additional paid in capital

(2)

Issued 61,750 shares of treasury stock upon the exercise of stock options and issuance of
restricted shares. Treasury stock was credited for $947,000 for the average cost of the treasury stock, and $81,000 was charged to additional paid in capital.

(3)

Issued 7,117 treasury shares related to the MedaSonics acquisition. Treasury stock was
credited for $109,000 and charged to the acquisition accrual upon issuance of the treasury stock.

Stockholders’ Rights Plan

Under our stockholders’ rights plan, each outstanding share of our common stock carries one-half of one preferred share purchase right (a Right). The Rights will
become exercisable only under certain circumstances involving acquisition of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of our common stock by a person or group (an Acquiring Person) without the prior consent of Cooper’s Board of Directors. If a
person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each Right would then entitle the holder (other than an Acquiring Person) to purchase, for the then purchase price of the Right (currently $145, subject to adjustment), shares of Cooper’s common
stock, or shares of common stock of any person into which we are thereafter merged or to which 50% or more of our assets or earning power is sold, with a market value of twice the purchase price. The Rights will expire in October 2007 unless earlier
exercised or redeemed. The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights for $.01 per Right prior to any person or group becoming an Acquiring Person.

Note 9. Employee Stock Plans

At October 31, 2004, Cooper had two stock-based compensation plans:

Amended and Restated 2001 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2001 LTIP)

The 2001 LTIP is designed to increase Cooper’s stockholder value by attracting, retaining and motivating key employees and consultants who directly influence our
profitability. Stockholders initially approved the 2001 LTIP in March 2001. Stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the 2001 LTIP in March 2003 and approved a subsequent amendment in March 2004.

The 2001 LTIP authorizes either Cooper’s Board of Directors or a designated committee
thereof composed of two or more Non-Employee Directors to grant to eligible individuals during the period



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

ending December 31, 2006, stock options for up to 4,950,000 shares of common stock, subject to adjustment for future stock splits, stock dividends,
expirations, forfeitures and similar events. Options generally become exercisable based on both Cooper’s stock price and time as the criteria. As of October 31, 2004, 1,815,500 shares remained available under the 2001 LTIP for future grants.

1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan for Non-Employee Directors (1996 NEDRSP)

The 1996 NEDRSP provides for annual grants of stock options and
restricted stock to Non-Employee Directors on November 1 and November 15, respectively, of each fiscal year. Specifically, each Non-Employee Director may be awarded the right to purchase 1,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock for
$0.10 per share. The restrictions on the restricted stock will lapse on the earlier of the date when the stock reaches certain target values or the fifth anniversary of the date of grant. Each Non-Employee Director may also be awarded options to
purchase common stock. On October 24, 2001, the term of the plan was extended by four years. On October 29, 2003, the NEDRSP was amended to reduce the number of stock options granted annually to Non-Employee Directors and the Company’s lead
director to 17,500 and 18,900, respectively.

Each Non-Employee Director was
granted an option to purchase 17,500 shares of Cooper’s common stock in fiscal 2004 and 30,000 shares in 2003 (or, in the case of the Vice Chairman and Lead Director of the Board who was a Non-Employee Director, 18,900 shares and 32,500 shares,
respectively). 1,320,000 shares of Cooper’s common stock had been reserved for this, of which 585,203 shares are held in treasury. As of October 31, 2004, 321,430 shares remained available under the 1996 NEDRSP for future grants. Restricted
shares of 6,000, 6,000 and 1,924 were granted under the 1996 NEDRSP in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. No restricted shares issued in connection with this plan had any restrictions remaining in effect as of October 31, 2004. The
weighted-average fair value of restricted stock issued in fiscal 2004 was $71.57 per share on grant-date.

Common stock activity under these plans was:



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

The options outstanding at October 31, 2004, for the stock option plans are:

The excess of market value over $.10
per share of restricted shares on respective dates of grant is initially recorded as unearned compensation and charged to operations as earned. Restricted shares and other stock compensation charged against operating income for the years ended
October 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $263,000, $257,000 and $114,000, respectively.

Note 10. Employee Benefits

Cooper’s Retirement Income
Plan

Cooper’s Retirement Income Plan (Plan) covers substantially all
full-time United States employees. Cooper’s contributions are designed to fund normal cost on a current basis and to fund over 30 years the estimated prior service cost of benefit improvements (15 years for annual gains and losses). The unit
credit actuarial cost method is used to determine the annual cost. Cooper pays the entire cost of the Plan and funds such costs as they accrue. Virtually all of the assets of the Plan are comprised of participation in equity and fixed income funds.
The pension plan’s intangible asset of $517,000 at October 31, 2004, is reported in other intangible assets.

The following table sets forth the Plan’s benefit obligations, fair value of the Plan assets, the funded status of the Plan at October 31 and net periodic pension
costs for the three-year period ended October 31, 2004.

Retirement Income Plan



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on a review of historical returns, both for this plan
and for medium- to large-sized defined benefit pension funds with similar asset allocations. This review generated separate expected returns for each asset class listed below. These expected future returns were then blended based on this Plan’s
target asset allocation.

Plan Assets

Weighted-average asset allocations at year end, by asset category are as follows:

The plan invests in a diversified
portfolio of assets intended to minimize risk of poor returns while maximizing expected portfolio returns. To achieve the long-term rate of return, plan assets will be invested in a mixture of instruments, including but not limited to, corporate
common stock (may include employer stock), investment grade bond funds, cash, small/large cap equity funds and international equity funds. The allocation of assets will be determined by the Investment Manager, and will typically include 50% to 70%
equities, with the remainder invested in fixed income and cash. Presently, this diversified portfolio is expected to return roughly 9.00% on a long-term basis.

Cash Flows

Contributions

The Company contributed
$1.5 million to its pension plan during the fiscal year. Total contributions during the last two fiscal years were in excess of $3.8 million. The Company closely monitors the funded status of the Plan with respect to legislative and accounting
rules. The Company intends to make at least the minimum required contribution during the 2004 – 2005 fiscal year.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

Cooper’s 401(k) Savings Plan

Cooper’s 401(k) Savings Plan provides for the deferral of compensation as described in the Internal Revenue Code and is available to
substantially all full-time United States employees of Cooper. Employees who participate in the 401(k) Plan may elect to have from 1% to 50% of their pre-tax salary or wages deferred and contributed to the trust established under the plan.
Cooper’s contribution on account of participating employees, net of forfeiture credits, was $1.1 million, $784,000 and $623,000 for the years ended October 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Cooper’s Incentive Payment Plan

Cooper’s Incentive Payment Plan is available to officers and other key employees.
Participants may, in certain years, receive bonuses based on performance. Total bonuses earned for the years ended October 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, were approximately $2.9 million, $3.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively.

Note 11. Commitments

Lease Commitments

Total minimum annual rental obligations (net of sublease revenue of approximately $79,000 through March 2005) under noncancelable operating leases (substantially all real
property or equipment) in force at October 31, 2004, are payable in subsequent years as follows:

Aggregate rental expense for both
cancelable and noncancelable contracts amounted to $8.3 million, $8.1 million and $7.4 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Note 12. Business Segment Information

Cooper is organized by product line for management reporting with operating income, as presented in our financial reports, the primary measure of segment profitability.
We do not allocate costs from corporate functions to the segments’ operating income. Items listed below operating income are not considered when measuring segment profitability. We use the same accounting policies to generate segment results as
we do for our overall accounting policies.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

Two business segments comprise Cooper’s operations:

•

CVI markets, develops and manufactures a broad range of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision care market.

•

CSI markets, develops and manufactures medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories used primarily by gynecologists and obstetricians.

Total net sales include sales to customers as reported in our
consolidated statements of income and sales between geographic areas that are priced at terms that allow for a reasonable profit for the seller. Operating income (loss) is total net sales less cost of sales, research and development expenses,
selling, general and administrative expenses and amortization of intangible assets. Corporate operating loss is principally corporate headquarters expense. Investment income, net; settlement of disputes, net; other income (expense), net and interest
expense are not allocated to individual segments. Our business segments do not rely on any one major customer.

Identifiable assets are those used in continuing operations except cash and cash equivalents, which we include as corporate assets.

Note 13. Subsequent Events

Acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc. (Unaudited)

On January 6, 2005, Cooper acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Ocular Sciences,
Inc., a global manufacturer and marketer of soft contact lenses, primarily spherical and daily disposable contact lenses that are brand and product differentiated by distribution channel.

The aggregate consideration paid for the stock of Ocular was about $1.2 billion plus transaction costs, less acquired cash and cash
equivalents. Cooper paid approximately $600 million in cash and issued approximately 10.7 million shares of its common stock to Ocular stockholders and option holders. Under the terms of the acquisition, each share of Ocular common stock was
converted into the right to receive 0.3879 of a share of Cooper common stock and $22.00 in cash without interest, plus cash for fractional shares. Outstanding Ocular stock options were redeemed in exchange for a combination of cash and Cooper stock
for the spread between their exercise prices and the value of the merger consideration immediately prior to closing.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – (Continued)

Our initial allocation of the purchase price is based on Ocular’s most recent SEC filing, as of September 30,
2004, and our preliminary estimates of the fair values of Ocular’s assets and liabilities. The allocation of the purchase price is subject to refinement as we are currently obtaining a third party valuation. Initially, we ascribed $913.9
million to goodwill, all of which was assigned to our CooperVision reporting unit. The purchase price allocation also includes $30 million in other intangible assets, $147.7 million of property, plant and equipment, $181 million of other tangible
assets and $122.7 million of liabilities assumed including $50 million of accrued acquisition costs. Research and development assets with no alternative future use will be written off to research and development on our consolidated statement of
income once determined.

On January 6, 2005, Cooper replaced its existing $225
million syndicated bank credit facility (see Note 6) with a $750 million credit agreement, of which a portion of the proceeds will be used to fund the cash portion of the consideration to Ocular shareholders. The facility consists of a $275 million
revolving credit facility, a $225 million term loan (Term A) and a $250 million term loan (Term B). The revolving facility and the Term A loan mature on January 6, 2010; the Term B loan matures on January 6, 2012. The new facility is subject to
usual and customary covenants, and interest rates are based on LIBOR plus additional basis points as determined by certain Cooper ratios. KeyBank is the administrative agent and JP Morgan Chase is the syndication agent for the twenty-three bank
syndication.

Repayment of the principal amounts of both Term A and Term B
follow a quarterly schedule beginning October 6, 2005, through the respective maturity date. We repay about 4% of the principal amount of Term A each quarter through January 6, 2007, then 6% through January 6, 2009, and 8% through January 6, 2010.
We repay about one-half percent of the principal amount of Term B per quarter through January 6, 2010, then 12% through January 6, 2012. In dollar terms, we repay $9.8 million in fiscal year 2005; $88.1 million in fiscal years 2006 and 2007
combined; $121.7 million for fiscal years 2008 and 2009 combined; and a total of $255.4 million for fiscal years 2010 through 2012.

Cash Dividend Declared

On January 5, 2005, we paid a semi-annual dividend of 3 cents per share to stockholders of record on December 16, 2004.

Item 9A.

Controls and Procedures.

The Company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in its reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that any material information relating to the Company is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to its principal officers to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

In conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter, the Company conducts a
review and evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, based upon such an evaluation as of October 31, 2004, the end of the fiscal year covered by this report, concluded that the Company’s
disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s
internal controls over financial reporting.
