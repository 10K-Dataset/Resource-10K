Item 1

. Business

.

The Cooper Companies, Inc. (Cooper or the Company), a Delaware corporation
organized in 1980, is a global medical device company publicly traded on the NYSE Euronext (NYSE: COO). Cooper is dedicated to serving the needs of the healthcare professional and improving the quality of life for its employees and customers through
its two business units, CooperVision, Inc. and CooperSurgical, Inc.

CooperVision is a leading manufacturer of soft contact lenses for the worldwide vision correction market. CooperVision produces a broad range of monthly,
two-week and single-use contact lenses, featuring advanced materials and optics. CooperVision brings a commitment to solving the toughest vision challenges such as astigmatism, presbyopia and ocular dryness; with a broad collection of spherical,
toric and multifocal contact lenses. Through a combination of innovative products and focused practitioner support, CooperVision brings a refreshing perspective to the marketplace. CooperVision’s products are primarily manufactured at its
facilities located in the United Kingdom, Puerto Rico and New York. CooperVision distributes products from Rochester, New York, Fareham, United Kingdom, Liege, Belgium, and various smaller international distribution facilities.

CooperSurgical is dedicated to providing medical devices and procedure
solutions that improve healthcare delivery to women in any clinical setting. CooperSurgical focuses on expansion of its core businesses and the introduction of advanced technology-based products to aid clinicians in the management and treatment of
commonly seen conditions. CooperSurgical customers are healthcare professionals and institutions providing care to and for women. CooperSurgical products support the point of healthcare delivery in the hospital, clinicians office and fertility
clinics. CooperSurgical’s major manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Trumbull, Connecticut, Pasadena, California, Stafford, Texas, Golden, Colorado, and Berlin, Germany.

CooperVision and CooperSurgical each operate in highly competitive
environments. Competition in the medical device industry involves the search for technological and therapeutic innovations. Both of Cooper’s businesses compete primarily on the basis of product quality and differentiation, technological
benefit, service and reliability.

COOPERVISION

CooperVision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services
three primary regions: the Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific. The contact lens market has two major product categories:

•

Spherical lenses including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects.

•

Toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as
astigmatism and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea.

In order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear, products are sold with recommended replacement schedules, often defined as modalities, with
the primary modalities being single-use, two-week and monthly.

CooperVision offers spherical, aspherical, toric, multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities. We believe that in order to compete
successfully in the numerous niches of the contact lens



market, companies must offer differentiated products that are priced competitively and manufactured efficiently. CooperVision believes that it is the only contact lens manufacturer to use three
different manufacturing processes to produce its lenses: lathing, cast molding and FIPS

™

, a cost-effective
combination of lathing and molding. This manufacturing flexibility allows CooperVision to compete in its markets by:

•

Producing high, medium and low volumes of lenses made with a variety of materials for a broader range of market niches: single-use, two-week, monthly
and quarterly disposable sphere and toric lenses and custom toric lenses for patients with a high degree of astigmatism.

•

Offering a wide range of lens parameters, leading to a higher successful fitting rate for practitioners and better visual acuity for patients.

In addition, CooperVision
lenses compete based on providing superior comfort through the use of lens edge technology. CooperVision lenses have a round to partial round edge which we believe increases comfort. CooperVision’s Proclear

®

line of spherical, toric and multifocal lenses are manufactured with omafilcon A, a material that incorporates
Phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology

™

that helps enhance tissue-device compatibility. Proclear lenses are the only
lenses with FDA clearance for the claim “… may provide improved comfort for contact lens wearers who experience mild discomfort or symptoms relating to dryness during lens wear.” Mild discomfort relating to dryness during lens
wear is a condition that often causes patients to discontinue contact lens wear.

Sales of contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials, a major product material in the industry, have grown significantly. Silicone hydrogel materials supply a higher level of oxygen to the
cornea, as measured by the transmissibility of oxygen through a given thickness of material, or “dk/t,” than traditional hydrogel lenses. In the past three years, CooperVision launched monthly silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and
multifocal lens products under our Biofinity

®

brand and two-week silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens
products under our Avaira

®

brand. In fiscal 2011, we launched our Biofinity spherical silicone hydrogel lens in
Japan and our Biofinity multifocal lens globally.

In addition to its PC Technology

™

and silicone hydrogel product
offerings, CooperVision competes in the contact lens market with its traditional hydrogel products.

Contact Lens Product Sales

Spheres:

Net sales of CooperVision’s spherical lenses, representing 61 percent of CooperVision’s soft lens net sales, grew 12 percent in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal 2010.
Single-use spherical lens net sales, representing 23 percent of soft lens sales, grew 18 percent.

Toric and Multifocal:

Net sales of CooperVision’s toric lenses, representing 31 percent of CooperVision’s soft lens net sales, grew 16 percent in fiscal 2011, as compared to fiscal
2010. Multifocal lens net sales, representing 7 percent of soft lens net sales, grew 4 percent in fiscal 2011.

Proclear:

Net sales of CooperVision’s PC Technology products – which consist of spherical, toric and multifocal
products, including Biomedics

®

XC and Proclear

®

1 Day – increased 10 percent in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and represented 28 percent of CooperVision’s soft lens net sales.

Silicone Hydrogel:

CooperVision’s silicone hydrogel spherical,
toric and multifocal lens products grew 49 percent in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 and represented 31 percent of CooperVision’s soft lens net sales as compared to 24 percent in fiscal 2010.



Contact Lens Product Sales by Geographic Region

Based on our knowledge of the contact lens market and our review of
available independent market data for calendar year 2010, we estimate the worldwide market for contact lenses by modality is 34 percent single-use, 36 percent two-week and 30 percent monthly. We estimate that the Americas market, representing about
38 percent of the worldwide soft contact lens market, by modality is 13 percent single-use, 58 percent two-week and 29 percent monthly; EMEA, representing about 29 percent of the worldwide market, is 38 percent single-use, 12 percent two-week
and 50 percent monthly; and Asia Pacific, representing about 33 percent of the worldwide market, is 55 percent single-use, 33 percent two-week and 12 percent monthly.

CooperVision Competition

The contact lens market is highly competitive. CooperVision’s three
largest competitors in the worldwide market and its primary competitors in the spherical, toric and multifocal lens categories of that market are Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc., CIBA Vision (owned by Novartis AG) and Bausch &
Lomb Incorporated.

Recent trends in marketing spherical lenses
include a global shift toward silicone hydrogel lenses and toward single-use lenses. CooperVision’s primary competitors currently control the majority of the silicone hydrogel segment of the market. CooperVision was late in entering the
silicone hydrogel segment of the market but has increased sales of its monthly and two-week toric and spherical lens offerings as well as the recently introduced monthly multifocal lens. In Japan, CooperVision recently launched Biofinity sphere, our
monthly spherical silicone hydrogel lens.

In the toric lens
market, we believe that lens manufacturers compete to provide the highest possible level of visual acuity and patient satisfaction by offering a wide range of lens parameters, superior wearing comfort and a high level of customer service, both for
patients and contact lens practitioners. CooperVision competes based on its three manufacturing processes yielding wider ranges of toric lens parameters, providing wide choices for patient and practitioner and superior visual acuity, as well as by
offering excellent customer service, including high standards of on-time product delivery.

CooperVision’s major competitors have greater financial resources and larger research and development budgets and sales forces. CooperVision seeks to offer a high level of customer service through
its direct sales organizations around the world and through telephone sales and technical service representatives who consult with eye care professionals about the use of the Company’s lens products.

CooperVision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and with
refractive surgical procedures that correct visual defects. CooperVision believes that its contact lenses will continue to compete favorably against eyeglasses, particularly in markets where the penetration of contact lenses in the vision correction
market is low, offering lens manufacturers an opportunity to gain market share. CooperVision also believes that laser vision correction is not a significant threat to its sales of contact lenses.

CooperVision Developments with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

In August 2011, CooperVision initiated a
recall on limited lots of Avaira

®

Toric contact lenses. In November 2011, this recall was expanded to cover
limited lots of Avaira Sphere contact lenses. The



recall was initiated because of the level of a residue (silicone oil) on certain lenses. The residue may cause hazy vision, severe eye pain or an eye injury. The manufacturing issue has been
identified and process changes have been implemented. These process changes are subject to review by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Avaira Toric and Avaira Sphere lenses that are subject to the recall represent less than 2% of
the Company’s fiscal 2011 net sales. Avaira Sphere lenses remain on the market, while Avaira Toric lenses are awaiting FDA authorization to return to the market. This recall is limited solely to specific lots of Avaira Toric and Avaira Sphere
contact lenses and no other CooperVision products are involved in this recall.

Separately, CooperVision’s distribution center in West Henrietta, New York, was recently inspected by the FDA and on December 7, 2011, we received a Warning Letter, dated December 5, 2011,
stating that certain labeling and packaging operations conducted at the facility deviate from applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements. We are working with the FDA to address the observations cited in the Warning Letter.
The Warning Letter does not restrict or prohibit the sale or marketing of our products, nor does it require us to recall any products distributed from the center. However, if we fail to correct the observations to FDA’s satisfaction, we could
be subject to an enforcement action, such as a seizure, FDA-mandated recall, or other operating restrictions on the CooperVision facility.

COOPERSURGICAL

CooperSurgical offers a broad array of products used in the care and treatment of women’s health. The Company participates in the women’s
healthcare market through offering quality products, innovative technologies and superior service to clinicians worldwide. CooperSurgical collaborates with clinicians to identify products and new technologies from disposable products to
sophisticated instruments and equipment. The result is a broad portfolio of proven products that aid in the delivery of improved clinical outcomes that healthcare professionals use routinely in the diagnosis and treatment of a wide spectrum of
women’s health issues.

Since its inception in 1990,
CooperSurgical has steadily grown its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model.

Market for Women’s Healthcare

CooperSurgical participates in the market for women’s healthcare with
its diversified product lines of over 600 products. CooperSurgical products are in three major categories based on the point of healthcare delivery: hospitals, obstetricians and gynecologists (ob/gyns) medical offices and fertility clinics.

Based on United States Census estimates, CooperSurgical expects
patient visits to United States ob/gyns to increase over the next decade. Driving this growth is an increasing base of reproductive age women, a large and stable middle-aged population and a rapidly growing population of women over the age of 65.
CooperSurgical believes that the resurgence of population growth in the reproductive age group will result in increased office visits related to birth control and childbearing. CooperSurgical expects growth in fertility treatments as more women
choose to delay childbearing to the mid-thirties and beyond. Office visit activity related to menopausal problems, including abnormal bleeding, incontinence and osteoporosis, are also expected to increase slightly over the next decade.



CooperSurgical believes that in the past clinicians primarily saw women only during their reproductive years. Now, with new treatment options available and a more educated population,
CooperSurgical expects the relationship between the patient and clinician will continue into the middle years and later.

Another trend in the market for women’s healthcare includes the migration of ob/gyn clinicians away from private practice ownership and towards
aligning with group practices or employment with hospitals and health systems. CooperSurgical believes that the market factors that are driving this trend will continue in the near-term.

While general medical practitioners play an important role in women’s primary care, the ob/gyn specialist is the primary
market for associated medical devices.

Some significant features
of this market are:

•

Patient visits are for annual checkups, cancer screening, menstrual disorders, vaginitis (inflammation of vaginal tissue), treatment of abnormal Pap
smears, osteoporosis (reduction in bone mass) and the management of menopause, pregnancy and reproductive management.

•

Ob/gyns traditionally provide the initial evaluation for women and their partners who seek infertility assistance. Ovulatory drugs and intrauterine
insemination (IUI) are common treatments of these cases along with embryo transfer procedures.

•

Osteoporosis and incontinence have become frequent diagnoses as the female population ages. Early identification and treatment of these conditions will
both improve women’s health and help reduce overall costs of treatment.

•

Sterilization is a frequently performed surgical procedure.

•

Hysterectomy, one of the most commonly performed surgical procedures, is increasingly performed using a laparoscopic approach.

•

The trend to move hospital-based procedures to an office or clinical setting is continuing as seen with the global endometrial ablation procedure.

CooperSurgical’s Fiscal 2011 Net Sales
Growth

During fiscal 2011, CooperSurgical’s net sales
grew 12 percent to $209.7 million from $188.0 million in fiscal 2010, representing 16 percent of Cooper’s net sales in both periods. Net sales growth excluding acquisitions was 8 percent. Sales of products used in surgical procedures grew
23 percent and represented 37 percent of CooperSurgical’s total net sales as compared to 33 percent in fiscal 2010.

CooperSurgical Competition

CooperSurgical focuses on selected segments of the women’s healthcare market, supplying diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories.
In some instances, CooperSurgical offers all of the items needed for a complete procedure. CooperSurgical believes that opportunities exist for continued market consolidation of smaller technology-driven firms that generally offer only one or two
product lines. Most are privately owned or divisions of public companies including some owned by companies with greater financial resources than Cooper.

Competitive factors in these segments include technological and scientific advances, product quality, price, customer service and effective communication
of product information to physicians and



hospitals. CooperSurgical competes based on its sales and marketing expertise and the technological advantages of its products. CooperSurgical’s strategy includes developing and acquiring
new products, including those used in new medical procedures. As CooperSurgical expands its product line, it also offers training for medical professionals in the appropriate use of its products.

CooperSurgical is seeking to expand its presence in the significantly larger
hospital and outpatient surgical procedure segment of the market that is at present dominated by bigger competitors such as Johnson & Johnson’s Ethicon Endo-Surgery and Ethicon Women’s Health and Urology companies, Boston
Scientific, Gyrus ACMI and Covidien. These competitors have well established positions within the operating room environment. CooperSurgical intends to leverage its relationship with gynecologic surgeons and focus on devices specific to gynecologic
surgery to facilitate its expansion within the surgical segment of the market.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Cooper employs 194 people in its research and development and manufacturing engineering departments. Most of these employees are in CooperVision. CooperVision product development and clinical research is
supported by internal and external specialists in lens design, formulation science, polymer chemistry, clinical trials, microbiology and biochemistry. CooperVision’s research and development activities include programs to develop disposable
silicone hydrogel products and product lines utilizing PC Technology.

CooperSurgical conducts research and development in-house and also has consulting agreements with external surgical specialists. CooperSurgical’s research and development activities include the
design of the next generation product line of uterine manipulators, the upgrade and expansion of CooperSurgical’s portfolio of assisted reproductive technology products as well as products within the general obstetrics and gynecology offerings.

Cooper-sponsored research and development expenditures during
fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $43.6 million, $35.3 million and $30.3 million, respectively, net of acquired in-process research and development of $3.0 million in 2009. Net research and development expenditures represented 3 percent of
net sales each fiscal year. During fiscal 2011, CooperVision represented 85 percent and CooperSurgical represented 15 percent of the total research and development expenses. We did not participate in any customer-sponsored research and development
programs during fiscal 2009 – 2011.

GOVERNMENT REGULATION

Medical Device Regulation

Our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the
United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States and other regulatory bodies abroad. FDA regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, recordkeeping,
premarket clearance or approval, advertising and promotion, and sales and distribution. Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to distribute commercially in the United States will require either prior 510(k) clearance or prior
premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA. A majority of the medical devices we currently market have received FDA clearance through the 510(k) process or approval through the PMA process. Because we cannot be assured that any new products we develop,
or any product enhancements, will be subject to the shorter 510(k) clearance process, significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements may occur.



Device Classification

The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes – Class I,
II or III – depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Both CooperVision and CooperSurgical develop and market medical devices under different
levels of FDA regulation depending on the classification of the device. Class III devices, such as flexible and extended wear contact lenses, require extensive premarket testing and approval, while Class I and II devices require lower levels of
regulation. The majority of CooperSurgical’s products are Class II devices.

Class I devices are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable
portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials (General Controls).
Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.

Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and
effectiveness of the device. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure. Pursuant to the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA),
unless a specific exemption applies, 510(k) premarket notification submissions are subject to user fees. Certain Class II devices are exempt from this premarket review process.

Class III devices are those devices which have a new intended use, or use
advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be assured solely by the General Controls and the other requirements described above. These
devices almost always require formal clinical studies to demonstrate safety and effectiveness and must be approved through the premarket approval process described below. Premarket approval applications (and supplemental premarket approval
applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees under MDUFMA than are 510(k) premarket notifications.

510(k) Clearance Pathway

When we are required to obtain a 510(k) clearance for a device that we wish to market, we must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is substantially equivalent to a
previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications. By regulation, the FDA is required to respond to a
510(k) premarket notification within 90 days of submission of the notification. As a practical matter, clearance can take significantly longer. If the FDA determines that the device, or its intended use, is not substantially equivalent to a
previously-cleared device or use, the FDA will place the device, or the particular use of the device, into Class III.

After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that changes its intended use,
will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require premarket approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If
the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination that a new clearance or approval is not required for a particular modification, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k)
clearance or premarket approval is obtained. In these circumstances, a



manufacturer also may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. We have made and plan to continue to make additional product enhancements and modifications to our devices that we
believe do not require new 510(k) clearances.

Premarket
Approval Pathway

A PMA application must be submitted if the
device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) premarket notification procedures. The PMA process is much more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data including, but not limited
to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.

After a PMA application is complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. The FDA, by statute and
regulation, has 180 days to review an accepted PMA application, although the review generally occurs over a significantly longer period of time, and can take up to several years. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information,
including clinical data, or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA
as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a preapproval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). New PMA applications or PMA application supplements are
required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and design of a device that is approved through the premarket approval process. Premarket approval supplements often require submission of the same type of information as
a premarket approval application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original premarket approval application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the
convening of an advisory panel.

Clinical Trials

A clinical trial is almost always required to support a PMA
application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) premarket notification. These trials generally require submission of an application for an investigational device exemption (IDE) to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate
data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that the potential benefits of testing the device in humans outweighs the risks and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by
the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated investigational device exemption requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the
IDE application is approved by both the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. All of Cooper’s currently marketed products have been cleared by all appropriate regulatory agencies, and Cooper has no
product currently being marketed under an IDE.

Continuing FDA
Regulation

After a device is placed on the market, numerous
regulatory requirements apply. These include: the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations, which prohibit the
promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their



device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. The FDA has
broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations.

Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in
enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall, seizure or import holds of our products; operating restrictions, suspension of production; refusing our request for
510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that are already granted and criminal prosecution.

Even if regulatory approval or clearance of a medical device is granted, the FDA may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for
which the device may be labeled and promoted. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. FDA regulations prohibit a manufacturer from promoting a device for an unapproved or
“off-label” use. Failure to comply with this prohibition on “off-label” promotion can result in enforcement action by the FDA, including, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil or
criminal penalties.

Foreign Regulation

Health authorities in foreign countries regulate Cooper’s clinical
trials and medical device sales. The regulations vary widely from country to country. Even if the FDA has approved a product, the regulatory agencies in each country must approve new products before they may be marketed there. The worldwide Medical
Device regulations are increasing, with many countries becoming regulated for the first time. For example Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia are becoming regulated and follow the Global Harmonization Task Force model for regulating medical devices.
These emerging regulated countries require the same rigorous safety data compiled in pre-clinical and clinical studies for the rest of the world. Japan has one of the most rigorous regulatory systems in the world and requires in-country clinical
trials. The Japanese quality and regulatory standards remain stringent even with the more recent harmonization efforts and updated Japanese regulations.

These regulatory procedures require a considerable investment in time and resources and usually result in a substantial delay between new product
development and marketing. If the Company does not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur after marketing, product approval may be withdrawn.

In addition to FDA regulatory requirements, the Company also maintains ISO
13485 certification and CE mark approvals for its products. A CE mark is an international symbol of adherence to certain standards and compliance with applicable European medical device requirements. These quality programs and approvals are required
by the European Medical Device Directive and must be maintained for all products intended to be sold in the European market. The ISO 13485 Quality Measurement System registration is now also required for registration of products in Asia Pacific and
Latin American countries. In order to maintain these quality benchmarks, the Company is subjected to rigorous biannual reassessment audits of its quality systems and procedures.

Other Health Care Regulation

We may be subject to various federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to
healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws, and laws pertaining to healthcare privacy



and security. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs,
including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs and TRICARE. Similarly if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be noncompliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to
sanctions, which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. While we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws, as applicable to us, because of the complex and
far-reaching nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our practices to be in compliance with these laws.

RAW MATERIALS

CooperVision’s raw materials primarily consist of various chemicals and
packaging materials and are generally available from more than one source. However, CooperVision relies on sole suppliers for certain raw materials used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products. In fiscal 2011, CooperVision purchased
certain assets of Asahikasei Aime Co., Ltd. (Aime), our current sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products, from Asahi Kasei Pharma Corporation. While this acquisition has increased
CooperVision’s control over the sourcing of certain raw materials, if current raw material suppliers fail to supply sufficient materials on a timely basis or at all for any reason, we may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone
hydrogel contact lens products.

Raw materials used by
CooperSurgical are generally available from more than one source. However, because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures, we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short
notice.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

CooperVision markets its products in the United States through its field
sales representatives, who call on optometrists, ophthalmologists, opticians, optical chains and distributors. CooperVision augments its United States sales and marketing efforts with e-commerce, telemarketing, social media and advertising in
professional journals. In the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, CooperVision primarily markets its products through its field sales representatives. In other countries, CooperVision uses distributors and has given some of them the exclusive right to
market its products within specific geographic areas.

CooperSurgical’s products are marketed by a network of dedicated field sales representatives, independent agents and distributors. In the United
States, CooperSurgical augments its sales and marketing activities by participating in national and regional industry tradeshows, professional educational programs and internet promotions including e-commerce, social media and collaborative efforts
with professional organizations, telemarketing, direct mail and advertising in professional journals.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS

Cooper owns or licenses a variety of domestic and foreign patents, which, in total, are material to its overall business. The names of certain of Cooper’s products are protected by trademark
registrations in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and, in some cases, also in foreign trademark offices. Applications are pending for additional trademark and patent registrations. Cooper intends to protect its intellectual property
rights aggressively.



No individual patent or license is material to the Company or either of its principal
business units other than our License Agreement effective as of November 19, 2007, between CooperVision and CIBA Vision AG and CIBA Vision Corporation. This license relates to patents covering CooperVision’s silicone hydrogel contact lens
products, Biofinity

®

and Avaira

®

. This license extends until the patents expire in 2014 in the United States and in 2016 outside of the United States.

In addition to trademarks and patent licenses, the Company owns certain trade
secrets, copyrights, know-how and other intellectual property.

DEPENDENCE ON CUSTOMERS

Neither of our business units depends to any material extent on any one customer or any one affiliated group of customers.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

Neither of our business units is materially subject to profit renegotiation
or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the United States government.

BACKLOG

Backlog is not a material factor in either of Cooper’s business units.

SEASONALITY

CooperVision’s contact lens sales in its fiscal first quarter, which runs from November 1 through January 31, are typically lower than subsequent quarters, as patient traffic to
practitioners’ offices is relatively light during the holiday season.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

Federal, state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or relate to the protection of the environment, do not currently materially affect Cooper’s capital
expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors.

Our business faces significant risks. These risks include those described
below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, and
the trading prices of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this report.

Risks Relating to Our Business

We operate in the highly competitive healthcare industry and there can be
no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully.

Each of our businesses operates within a highly competitive environment. In our soft contact lens business, CooperVision faces intense competition from
competitors’ products, in particular silicone hydrogel contact lenses, and may face increasing competition as other new products enter the market. Our major competitors in the contact lens business, Johnson & Johnson Vision Care, Inc.,
CIBA Vision (owned by Novartis AG) and Bausch & Lomb, Inc., have substantially greater financial resources, larger research and development budgets, larger sales forces, greater market penetration and larger manufacturing volumes than
CooperVision. They also offer competitive products and differentiated materials, plus a variety of other eye care products including lens care products and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals, which may give them a competitive advantage in marketing their
lenses. The market for contact lenses is intensely competitive and is characterized by declining sales volumes for older product lines and growing demand for silicone hydrogel based products. Our ability to respond to these competitive pressures
will depend on our ability to decrease our costs and maintain gross margins and operating results and to introduce new products successfully, on a timely basis in the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific, and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies and
sufficient manufacturing capacity and capabilities for such products. Any significant decrease in our costs per lens will depend, in part, on our ability to increase sales volume and production capabilities. Our failure to respond to competitive
pressures in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

To a lesser extent, CooperVision also competes with manufacturers of eyeglasses and providers of other forms of vision correction including ophthalmic
surgery.

There can be no assurance that we will not encounter
increased competition in the future, or that our competitors’ newer contact lens products will not successfully erode CooperVision’s contact lens business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

In the women’s healthcare market,
competitive factors include technological and scientific advances, product quality, price and effective communication of product information to physicians and hospitals. CooperSurgical competes with a number of manufacturers in each of its niche
areas, some of which have substantially greater financial and personnel resources and sell a much broader range of products, which may give them an advantage in marketing competitive products.

Acquisitions that we have made and may make in the future involve numerous risks.

We have a history of acquiring businesses and products that have
significantly contributed to our growth in recent years. As part of our growth strategy, particularly at CooperSurgical, we intend to



continue to consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt
and contingent liabilities and an increase in amortization and/or write-offs of goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks we could face
with respect to acquisitions include:

•

difficulties in the integration of the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired company and establishment of appropriate
accounting controls and reporting procedures and other regulatory compliance procedures;

•

risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience;

•

potential loss of employees;

•

an inability to identify and consummate future acquisitions on favorable terms or at all;

•

diversion of management’s attention away from other business concerns;

•

expenses of any undisclosed or potential liabilities of the acquired company;

•

expenses, including restructuring expenses, to shut-down our own locations or terminate our employees;

•

a dilution of earnings per share; and

•

risks inherent in accounting allocations.

Product innovations are important in the industry in which we operate, and we face the risk of product obsolescence.

Product innovations are important in the contact lens market in which
CooperVision competes and in the niche areas of the healthcare industry in which CooperSurgical competes. Historically, we did not allocate substantial resources to new product development, but rather purchased, leveraged or licensed the technology
developments of others. However, since 2005, we have been investing more in new product development, including the development of silicone hydrogel-based contact lenses. Although our focus is on products that will be marketable immediately or in the
short to medium term rather than on funding longer-term, higher risk research and development projects, time commitments, the cost of obtaining necessary regulatory approval and other costs related to product innovations can be substantial. There
can be no assurance that we will successfully obtain necessary regulatory approvals or clearances for our new products or that our new products will successfully compete in the marketplace and, as a result, justify the expense involved in their
development and regulatory approval. In addition, our competitors may have developed or may in the future develop new products or technologies, such as contact lenses with anti-microbial or anti-allergenic features, that could lead to the
obsolescence of one or more of our products. Competitors may also introduce new uses for contact lenses, such as for drug delivery or the control of myopia. Failure to develop new product offerings and technological changes and to offer products
that provide performance that is at least comparable to competing products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.

If our products are not accepted by the market, we will not be able to
sustain or expand our business.

Certain of our proposed
products have not yet been clinically tested or commercially introduced, and we cannot assure that any of them, assuming they receive necessary regulatory approvals, will achieve



market acceptance or generate operating profits. In addition, we have been slower to introduce new silicone hydrogel contact lens products than our competitors which put these products at a
competitive disadvantage. Market acceptance and customer demand for these products are uncertain. The development of a market for our products may be influenced by many factors, some of which are out of our control, including:

•

acceptance of our products by eye care and women’s healthcare practitioners;

•

the cost competitiveness of our products;

•

consumer reluctance to try and use a new product;

•

regulatory requirements;

•

adequate coverage and reimbursement by third party payors;

•

the earlier release of competitive products, such as silicone hydrogel products, into the market by our competitors; and

•

the emergence of newer and more competitive products.

New medical and technological developments may reduce the need for our
products.

Technological developments in the eye care and
women’s healthcare industries, such as new surgical procedures or medical devices, may limit demand for our products. Corneal refractive surgical procedures such as Lasik surgery and the development of new pharmaceutical products may decrease
the demand for our optical products. If these new advances provide a practical alternative to traditional vision correction, the demand for contact lenses and eyeglasses may materially decrease. We cannot assure that medical advances and
technological developments will not have a material adverse effect on our businesses.

Our substantial and expanding international operations are subject to uncertainties which could affect our operating results.

A significant portion of our current operations for CooperVision are
conducted and located outside the United States, and our growth strategy involves expanding our existing foreign operations and entering into new foreign jurisdictions. We have significant manufacturing and distribution sites in North America and
Europe. Approximately two-thirds of our net sales for CooperVision for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, were derived from the sale of products outside the United States. We believe that sales outside the United
States will continue to account for a material portion of our total net sales for the foreseeable future. International operations and business expansion plans are subject to numerous additional risks, including:

•

we may have difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights in some foreign countries;

•

we may have difficulty gaining market share in countries such as Japan because of regulatory restrictions and customer preferences;

•

we may find it difficult to grow in emerging markets such as China, India and other developing nations due to, among other things, customer acceptance,
undeveloped distribution channels, regulatory restrictions and business knowledge of these new markets;

•

tax rates in some foreign countries may exceed those of the United States, and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the
imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;



•

we may find it difficult to comply with a variety of United States and foreign compliance and regulatory requirements such as the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and the U.K. Bribery Act;

•

we may find it difficult to manage a large organization spread throughout various countries;

•

fluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our results;

•

foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the United States;

•

failure to comply with United States Department of Commerce export controls may result in fines and/or penalties;

•

general economic and political conditions in the countries where we operate may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries or not be
favorable to our growth strategy;

•

foreign governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business and market
opportunities; and

•

we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through some foreign legal systems.

As we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in
large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. However, any of these factors could adversely affect our international operations and, consequently, our operating
results.

Current market conditions and recessionary pressures
in one or more of our markets could impact our ability to grow our business.

In the United States and globally, market and economic conditions have been unprecedented over the past few years and challenging with tighter credit conditions and slower economic growth. The U.S.
economy has experienced a recession and faces continued concerns about the systemic impacts of adverse economic conditions such as high energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, and an unstable real estate market.
Foreign countries, in particular the Euro zone, are affected by similar systemic impacts. As a result, we continue to have lower than historical expectations for market growth in fiscal 2012.

Continued turbulence in the United States and international market and economic conditions may adversely affect our liquidity
and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers. If these market conditions continue, they may limit our ability, and the ability of our customers, to replace maturing liabilities and to access the capital markets
to meet liquidity needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

We face risks associated with disruption of manufacturing and distribution operations and failure to develop new manufacturing processes that could
adversely affect our profitability or competitive position.

We manufacture a significant portion of the medical device products we sell. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing manufacturing
facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disaster, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events), enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory body if
we are found to



be in non-compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) or other reasons, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, materials such as silicone hydrogel require improvements to our manufacturing processes to make them cost effective. While we have improved our manufacturing capabilities for our silicone hydrogel products, our failure to continue to
develop improvements to our manufacturing processes and reduce our cost of goods could significantly impact our ability to compete.

CooperVision manufactures molded contact lenses, which represent the majority of our contact lens revenues, primarily at our facilities in the United
Kingdom and Puerto Rico. CooperSurgical manufactures the majority of its products in Trumbull, Connecticut, Stafford, Texas, and Pasadena, California. We manufacture certain products at only one manufacturing site for certain markets, and certain of
our products are approved for manufacturing only at one site. Before we can use a second manufacturing site, we must obtain the approval of regulatory authorities, and because this process is expensive, we have generally not sought approvals needed
to manufacture at an additional site. If there were any prolonged disruption in the operations of the approved facility, it could take a significant amount of time to validate a second site and replace lost product, which could result in lost
customers and thereby reduce sales, profitability and market share.

CooperVision distributes products out of West Henrietta, New York, the United Kingdom, Belgium and various smaller international distribution facilities.
Our distribution center in West Henrietta, New York, was recently inspected by FDA and, on December 7, 2011, we received a Warning Letter dated December 5, 2011, stating that certain labeling and packaging operations conducted at the
facility deviate from applicable cGMP requirements. We are working with the FDA to address the observations cited in the Warning Letter. The Warning Letter does not restrict or prohibit the sale or marketing of our products, nor does it require us
to recall any products distributed from the center. However, if we fail to correct the observations to the FDA’s satisfaction, we could be subject to an enforcement action, such as a seizure, FDA-mandated recall, or other operating restrictions
on the facility, that could have a material adverse effect on our business. CooperSurgical’s products are primarily distributed out of its facility in Trumbull, Connecticut. Any prolonged disruption in the operations of our existing
distribution facilities, whether due to technical or labor difficulties, destruction of or damage to any facility (as a result of natural disaster, use and storage of hazardous materials or other events) or other reasons, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If our manufacturing operations fail to comply with applicable regulations, our manufacturing could be delayed or disrupted, and our product sales and profitability could suffer.

Our manufacturing operations and processes are required to comply with
numerous federal, state and foreign regulatory requirements, including the FDA’s cGMP for medical devices, known as the QSR regulations, which govern the procedures related to the design, testing, production processes, controls, quality
assurance, labeling, packaging, storage, importing, exporting and shipping of our products. We also are subject to state requirements and licenses applicable to manufacturers of medical devices. In addition, we must engage in extensive recordkeeping
and reporting and must make available our manufacturing facilities and records for periodic unscheduled inspections by governmental agencies, including the FDA, state authorities and comparable agencies in other countries. Failure to pass a cGMP,
QSR or similar foreign inspection or to comply with these and other applicable regulatory requirements could result in disruption of our operations and manufacturing delays in addition to, among other things, significant fines, suspension of
approvals, seizures, recalls or import holds of



products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. As a result, any failure to comply with applicable requirements could adversely affect our product sales and profitability. We are
currently working with the FDA to address a Warning Letter dated December 5, 2011, which was issued by the FDA following an inspection of the labeling and packaging operations performed at our distribution center in West Henrietta, New York. If
we fail to resolve the observations cited in the Warning Letter to the FDA’s satisfaction, we would be subject to the foregoing regulatory enforcement actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We rely on independent suppliers for raw materials and we could experience
inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative supplier on short notice.

We rely on independent suppliers for key raw materials, consisting primarily of various chemicals and packaging materials. Raw materials used in our operations are generally available from more than one
source. However, because some products require specialized manufacturing procedures, we could experience inventory shortages if we were required to use an alternative manufacturer on short notice. We have purchased Asahikasei Aime Co. Ltd. to
achieve greater control over certain of the raw materials used in our silicone hydrogel contact lenses. However, Asahikasei Finechem (Asahi) remains our sole supplier of the primary material used to make our silicone hydrogel contact lens products,
Biofinity and Avaira. We may suffer a disruption in the supply of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products if Asahi or other suppliers fail to supply sufficient material on a timely basis or at all for any reason and/or we need to switch to an
alternative supplier. A disruption in the supply of raw materials could disrupt production of our silicone hydrogel contact lens products thereby adversely impacting our ability to market and sell such products and our ability to compete in this
important segment of the contact lens market.

If we fail to
protect our intellectual property adequately, our business could suffer.

We consider our intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and licensing agreements, to be an integral component of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights
through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements. Our failure to obtain or maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property
rights for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may also seek to enforce our intellectual property rights on others through litigation. Our claims, even if meritorious, may be found invalid or
inapplicable to a party we believe infringes or has misappropriated our intellectual property rights. In addition, litigation can:

•

be expensive and time consuming to prosecute or defend;

•

result in a finding that we do not have certain intellectual property rights or that such rights lack sufficient scope or strength;

•

divert management’s attention and resources; or

•

require us to license our intellectual property.

We have applied for patent protection in the United States and other foreign
jurisdictions relating to certain existing and proposed processes and products. We cannot assure that any of our patent applications will be approved. Patent applications in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy
for a period of time, which may last until patents are issued, and since



publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months, we cannot be certain that we will be the first creator of inventions
covered by any patent application we make or the first to file patent applications on such inventions. The patents we own could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others and may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide us with
any meaningful protection or commercial advantage. We also cannot assure that we will have adequate resources to enforce our patents.

We also rely on unpatented proprietary technology. It is possible that others will independently develop the same or similar technology or otherwise
obtain access to our unpatented technology. To protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information, we require employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements and assignment agreements, which
generally provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, we cannot assure that these confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection for our trade
secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using
our trade secrets is difficult, expensive and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. Certain patents protecting our Proclear line of products expired in fiscal year 2011, which allows competitors to market and sell products with similar
attributes.

We rely on trademarks to establish a market identity
for our products. To maintain the value of our trademarks, we might have to file lawsuits against third parties to prevent them from using trademarks confusingly similar to or dilutive of our registered or unregistered trademarks. We also might not
obtain registrations for our pending or future trademark applications, and might have to defend our registered trademark and pending applications from challenge by third parties. Enforcing or defending our registered and unregistered trademarks
might result in significant litigation costs and damages, including the inability to continue using certain trademarks.

The laws of foreign countries in which we do business or contemplate doing business in the future do not recognize intellectual property rights or protect
them to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Adverse determinations in a judicial or administrative proceeding could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products or prevent us from stopping others from manufacturing and
selling competing products, and thereby have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our products or processes could be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property of others.

Our competitors in both the United States and foreign countries, many of
which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our
ability to make and sell our existing and planned products. Claims that our products, business methods or processes infringe upon the proprietary rights of others often are not asserted until after commencement of commercial sales of products
incorporating our technology.

Significant litigation regarding
intellectual property rights exists in our industry. Third parties have made, and may make in the future, claims of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology. Any claims, even those without
merit, could:

•

be expensive and time consuming to defend;



•

cause us to cease making, licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

•

require us to redesign or reengineer our products, if feasible;

•

divert management’s attention and resources; or

•

require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements in order to obtain the right to use a necessary product, component or process.

We cannot be certain of the outcome of any
litigation. Any royalty or licensing agreement, if required, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of some of our
products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

A successful claim of infringement against us or our contract manufacturers in connection with the use of our technology, in particular if we are unable to manufacture or sell any of our planned products
in any major market, could adversely affect our business.

We
could experience losses from product liability claims, including such claims and other losses resulting from sales of counterfeit and other infringing products.

We face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the
event that the use of our products results in personal injury. We also face the risk that defects in the design or manufacture of our products or sales of counterfeit or other infringing products might necessitate a product recall and other actions
by manufacturers, distributors or retailers in order to safeguard the health of consumers and protect the integrity of the subject brand. Consumers may halt or delay purchases of a product that is the subject of a claim or recall, or has been
counterfeited. We handle some risk with third-party carrier policies that are subject to deductibles and limitations. There can be no assurance that we will not experience material losses due to product liability claims or recalls, or a decline in
sales resulting from sales of counterfeit or other infringing products, in the future.

We face risks related to environmental matters.

Our facilities are subject to a broad range of United States federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and requirements, including those governing discharges to the air and water, the handling
or disposal of solid and hazardous substances and wastes, remediation of contamination associated with the release of hazardous substances at our facilities and offsite disposal locations and occupational safety and health. We have made, and will
continue to make, expenditures to comply with such laws and requirements. Future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or the enforcement thereof, or the discovery of contamination at our facilities, may give rise to additional
compliance or remediation costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such laws and requirements are constantly changing, are different in every jurisdiction and can impose
substantial fines and sanctions for violations. As a manufacturer of various products, we are exposed to some risk of claims with respect to environmental matters, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred
in connection with any such claims.

Our indebtedness could
adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.

We have now and expect to continue to have a significant amount of indebtedness.



Our indebtedness could:

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our
cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, research and development efforts and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•

place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt;

•

limit our ability to borrow additional funds; and

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, including our obligation to repay our credit facility under certain
circumstances.

Our credit facility contains
financial and other restrictive covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interests. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived,
could result in the acceleration of all of our debt, which could adversely affect our business, earnings and financial condition.

We are vulnerable to interest rate risk with respect to our debt.

We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with the issuance of
variable and fixed-rate debt. In order to maintain our desired mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt, we currently use, and may continue to use, interest rate swap agreements and exchange fixed and variable-rate interest payment obligations over
the life of the arrangements, without exchange of the underlying principal amounts. We may not be successful in structuring such swap agreements to manage our risks effectively, which could adversely affect our business, earnings and financial
condition.

Exchange rate fluctuations and our foreign currency
hedges could adversely affect our financial results.

As a
result of our international operations, currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect our results of operations and financial position. Our most significant currency exposures are the British pound sterling, euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
We expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenue and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Although from time to time we enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to
reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt or receivables obligations, these hedging transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely. These hedges may also serve to reduce any gain that we may have made
based on favorable foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, to the extent we are unable to match revenue received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency, exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative impact on our financial
condition and results of operations. Because our consolidated financial results are reported in dollars, if we generate sales or earnings in other currencies the translation of those results into dollars can result in a significant increase or
decrease in the amount of those sales or earnings and can make it more difficult for our shareholders to understand the relative strengths or weaknesses of the underlying business on a period-over-period comparative basis.



Increases in our effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of income tax returns
could adversely affect our results.

Our future effective tax
rates could be adversely affected by earnings being higher than anticipated in countries where the Company has higher statutory rates or lower than anticipated in countries where it has lower statutory rates, by changes in valuation of our deferred
tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Notice of Deficiency in connection with its audit of the Company’s income tax returns for the years
2005 and 2006. The Notice asserts that the Company is subject to additional taxes due to a proposed adjustment under the anti-deferral provisions of Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. If sustained, such taxes should be offset by the
Company’s existing federal net operating loss carryforwards leaving a $1.2 million balance of proposed taxes owed. The Company intends to defend its positions taken in its income tax returns vigorously. However, if the IRS’s contentions
were sustained, the Company’s existing federal net operating loss carryforwards could be materially reduced, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s future net income. We are also subject to the examination of our
income tax returns by other tax authorities and the outcome of these examinations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.

We operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our
results.

We operate globally and changes in tax laws could
adversely affect our results. We have overseas manufacturing, administrative and sales offices and generate substantial revenues and profits in foreign jurisdictions. Recently, a number of countries, including the United States, have proposed
changes to their tax laws, some of which affect taxation of earnings recognized in foreign jurisdictions. Such changes in tax laws or their interpretation, if adopted, could adversely affect our effective tax rates and our results. For example, the
recently enacted Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 imposes a new excise tax of 2-3 percent of the price for which certain medical devices are sold. CooperVision is not affected by this new tax. Almost all of CooperSurgical’s
sales will be subject to this new tax that takes effect January 1, 2013. We cannot at this time anticipate the magnitude of this new tax that would be imposed on us as there are significant uncertainties concerning key definitions and terms
within the law.

Volatility in the securities markets, interest
rates, and other factors could substantially increase our defined benefit pension costs.

We sponsor a defined benefit pension plan for employees in the United States. This defined benefit pension plan is funded with trust assets invested in a diversified portfolio of securities and other
investments. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, early retirement rates, investment returns, discount rates and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan and cause volatility in the net
periodic benefit cost and future funding requirements of the plan. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations.

We manage our businesses utilizing complex computer systems that are
regularly maintained and upgraded, an interruption to these systems could disrupt our business or force us to expend excessive costs.

We utilize complex computer systems, including enterprise resource planning and warehouse management systems, to support our business units and we
have a continuous improvement strategy in



place that keep our systems and overarching technology stable and in line with business needs and growth. Regular upgrades of our computer hardware and software revisions are typical and
expected. We employ controlled change management methodologies to plan, test and execute all such system upgrades and improvements, and we believe that we assign adequate staffing and other resources to projects to ensure successful
implementation. However, we cannot assure that our systems will meet our future business needs or that upgrades will operate as designed. We cannot assure that there will not be associated excessive costs or disruptions in portions of our
business in the course of our maintenance, support and/or upgrade of these systems.

If we do not retain our key personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees, our business could suffer.

If we fail to recruit and retain the necessary personnel, our business and
our ability to obtain new customers, develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer. The success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel. Our success also depends on
our ability to recruit, retain and motivate highly skilled sales, marketing, engineering and scientific personnel. Competition for these persons in our industry is intense, and we may not be able to successfully recruit, train or retain qualified
personnel.

Provisions of our governing documents and Delaware
law, and our rights plan, may have anti-takeover effects.

Certain provisions of our Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated By-laws may inhibit changes in control of the Company not
approved by our board of directors. These provisions include: (i) advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations and (ii) the authority of our board to issue without stockholder approval preferred stock with such
terms as our board may determine. We also have the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. Our board of directors extended our preferred stock purchase rights plan, commonly known as
a “poison pill,” pursuant to an amended rights agreement dated as of October 29, 2007 that expires on October 29, 2017. The rights agreement is intended to prevent abusive hostile takeover attempts by requiring a potential
acquirer to negotiate the terms of an acquisition with our board of directors. However, it could have the effect of deterring or preventing an acquisition of our Company, even if a majority of our stockholders would be in favor of such acquisition,
and could also have the effect of making it more difficult for a person or group to gain control of the Company or to change existing management.

Risks Relating to Government Regulation of Manufacture and Sale of Our Products

Our failure to comply with regulatory requirements or to receive regulatory clearance or approval for our products or
operations could adversely affect our business.

Our products
and operations are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA, and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. In the United States, the FDA regulates virtually all aspects of a medical device’s design, development,
testing, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, promotion and distribution, as well as the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to foreign markets. Our failure to comply with FDA
regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative or judicial sanctions, including injunctions, suspensions or the loss of regulatory approvals, product recalls, termination of distribution or product seizures. In the most egregious cases,
criminal sanctions or closure of our manufacturing facilities are possible.



Our medical devices require clearance or approval by the FDA before they can be commercially distributed in
the United States and may require similar approvals by foreign regulatory agencies before distribution in foreign jurisdictions. Medical devices may only be marketed for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. The process of
obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals to market a medical device, particularly from the FDA, can be costly and time consuming. There can be no assurance that such clearances and approvals will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, or that
significant delays in the introduction of any new products or product enhancements will not occur, which could adversely affect our competitive position and results of operations. In addition, the FDA may change its policies, adopt additional
regulations or revise existing regulations, each of which could prevent or delay premarket approval or clearance of our products or could impact our ability to market our currently approved or cleared products. For example, the FDA has recently been
reviewing the premarket clearance process in response to internal and external concerns regarding the 510(k) program. In January 2011, the FDA announced a plan of action that included twenty-five action items designed to make the process more
rigorous and transparent. Since then the FDA has implemented some changes intended to improve its premarket programs. Some of these changes and proposals under consideration could impose additional regulatory requirements on us that could delay our
ability to obtain new 510(k) clearances for our products, increase the cost of compliance, or restrict our ability to maintain our current clearances.

Modifications and enhancements to a medical device also require a new FDA clearance or approval if they could significantly affect its safety or
effectiveness or would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer’s decision. We have made
modifications and enhancements to our medical devices that we do not believe require a new clearance or application, but we cannot confirm that the FDA will agree with our decisions. If the FDA requires us to seek clearance or approval for
modification of a previously cleared product for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be
subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and competitive position. We also cannot assure that we will be successful in obtaining clearances or approvals for our
modifications, if required.

Even if regulatory approval or
clearance of a medical device is granted, the FDA may impose limitations or restrictions on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted, and failure to comply with FDA regulations prohibiting a manufacturer from
promoting a device for an unapproved, or “off-label” use could result in enforcement action by the FDA, including, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil or criminal penalties.

Development and marketing of our products are subject to strict
governmental regulation by foreign regulatory agencies, and failure to receive, or delay in receiving, foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business.

In many of the foreign countries in which we market our products, we are subject to regulations affecting, among other things,
product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. Many of the regulations applicable to our devices and products in such countries are similar to those of the FDA.

In the European Economic Area, a medical device can only be
placed on the market if it is in conformity with the essential requirements set out in the European Directives and implementing



regulations that govern medical devices. These Directives prescribe quality programs and standards which must be maintained in order to achieve required ISO certification and to approve the use
of CE marking. In order to maintain ISO certification and CE marking quality benchmarks, firms’ quality systems and procedures are subjected to rigorous periodic inspections and reassessment audits.

In many countries, the national health or social security organizations
require our products to be qualified before they can be marketed with the benefit of reimbursement eligibility. To date, we have not experienced difficulty in complying with these regulations. However, our failure to receive, or delays in the
receipt of, relevant foreign qualifications could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our products are subject to reporting requirements and recalls, even after receiving regulatory clearance or approval, which could harm our reputation,
business and financial results.

After a device is placed on
the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, including the FDA’s QSR regulations, which require manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and medical device reporting regulations that require us to report to FDA or similar governmental
bodies in other countries if our products malfunction in a way that would be reasonably likely to contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur. The FDA and similar governmental bodies in other countries have the authority
to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Medical device manufacturers, such as CooperVision and CooperSurgical, may under their own initiative recall a product if a reasonable
possibility of serious injury or any material deficiency in a device is found. For example, in August of 2011, CooperVision in collaboration with the FDA initiated a recall of limited lots of Avaira Toric contact lenses which in November of
2011 was expanded to include limited lots of Avaira Sphere contact lenses. This recall is ongoing and requires authorization of the FDA to return the Avaira Toric product to market. Recalls of any of our products, including any expansion of the
ongoing Avaira recall, may divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A recall, including the ongoing Avaira recall, could harm our reputation with customers and
consumers which could reduce the sales of our products. In addition, the FDA or other foreign governmental agencies may implement enforcement actions in connection with a recall which could impair our product offerings and be harmful to our business
and financial results.

Changes in legislation and government
regulation of the healthcare industry as well as third-party payors’ efforts to control the costs of healthcare could materially adversely affect our business.

In recent years, an increasing number of healthcare reform proposals have
been formulated by the legislative and executive branches of the United States federal and state governments. In March 2010, the President signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education
Affordability Reconciliation Act, which we refer to collectively as the Health Care Reform Law. The Health Care Reform Law makes extensive changes to the delivery of health care in the United States. Among the provisions of the Health Care Reform
Law of greatest importance to the medical device industry are the following:

•

A deductible 2.3 percent excise tax on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States, with limited
exceptions, effective January 1, 2013;



•

A new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along
with funding for such research;

•

New reporting and disclosure requirements on medical device manufacturers for any “transfer of value” made or distributed to prescribers and
other healthcare providers, effective March 30, 2013;

•

Payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the
coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models, beginning on or before January 1, 2013;

•

Creation of the Independent Payment Advisory Board which, beginning in 2014, will have authority to recommend certain changes to reduce Medicare
spending and those recommendations could have the effect of law even if Congress doesn’t act on the recommendations; and

•

Establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to test innovative payment and service
delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, beginning by January 1, 2011.

These measures could result in decreased net revenues from our medical device products and decrease potential returns from our development efforts. Many of the details regarding the implementation of the
Health Care Reform Law are yet to be determined, and at this time, it remains unclear the full effect that the Health Care Reform Law would have on our business.

Also, any adoption of healthcare reform proposals on a state-by-state basis
could require us to develop state-specific marketing and sales approaches. In addition, we may experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of our products due to additional legislative proposals or healthcare reform initiatives,
including those initiatives affecting coverage and reimbursement for our products. Future legislation and regulations may adversely affect the growth of the market for our products or demand for our products. We cannot predict the effect such
reforms or the prospect of their enactment may have on our business.

In addition, third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, whether inside the United States or abroad, increasingly attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare. These cost-control
methods include prospective payment systems, capitated rates, group purchasing, redesign of benefits, requiring pre-authorizations or second opinions prior to certain medical procedures, encouragement of healthier lifestyles and exploration of more
cost-effective methods of delivering healthcare. Although cost controls or other requirements imposed by third-party payors have not historically had a significant effect on contact lens prices or distribution practices, this could change in the
future and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The costs of complying with the requirements of federal laws pertaining to the privacy and security of health information and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could materially
adversely affect our business and results of operations.

Other federal legislation affects the manner in which we use and disclose health information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
1996, or HIPAA, mandates, among other things, the adoption of standards for the electronic exchange of health information that may require significant and costly changes to current practices. The United States Department of Health and Human Services
(HHS) has released several rules mandating the use of specified standards with respect to certain healthcare transactions and health information. The electronic transactions rule



requires the use of uniform standards for common healthcare transactions, including healthcare claims information, plan eligibility, referral certification and authorization, claims status, plan
enrollment and disenrollment, payment and remittance advice, plan premium payments and coordination of benefits. The privacy rule imposes standards governing the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information. The security rule
released by HHS establishes minimum standards for the security of electronic health information, and requires the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards.

Additionally, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical
Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 was signed into law as part of the America’s Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February 2009. Previously, HIPAA directly regulated only certain covered entities, such as health care providers and health plans. Under
the HITECH Act, certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards are now also directly applicable to covered entities’ business associates. As a result, business associates are now subject to civil and criminal penalties for failure to
comply with applicable privacy and security rule requirements. Moreover, the HITECH Act set forth new notification requirements for health data security breaches, increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered
entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with
pursuing federal actions.

While we do not believe that we are a
covered entity or a business associate under HIPAA, many of our customers may be covered entities or business associates subject to HIPAA. Some customers as an expectation of transacting business with us may require us to enter into business
associate agreements, which would obligate us to safeguard and restrict the manner in which we use certain protected health information (as defined by HIPAA) we obtain in the course of our commercial relationship with them, triggering potential
liability on us for failure to meet our contractual obligations. Alternatively, some customers may limit the scope of our commercial relationship with them with regard to our access to certain protected health information. Pursuant to the HITECH
Act, if the government determines that we are a business associate, we could be additionally subject to direct governmental enforcement for failure to comply with certain privacy and security requirements. The costs of complying with these
contractual obligations and new legal and regulatory requirements, and the potential liability associated with failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We may be subject to various federal, state and foreign laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws, physician self-referral laws and false claims laws. Violations of these
laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Administration health programs and TRICARE. Similarly,
if the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we do business are found to be non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions, which could indirectly have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. While we believe that our operations are in material compliance with such laws, because of the complex and far-reaching nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that we would not be required to alter one or more of our
practices to be in compliance with these laws. Indeed, recent changes in state laws and model codes of ethics have already required us to alter certain of our



compliance efforts. For example, in April of 2009, Massachusetts issued regulations governing the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers with respect to healthcare
practitioners. This regulation became effective on July 1, 2009 and sets forth what medical device manufacturers may and may not permissibly do with respect to providing meals, sponsoring continuing medical education and otherwise providing
payments or items of economic benefit to healthcare practitioners located within the state. Additionally, the regulation requires medical device manufacturers to have in place robust fraud and abuse compliance programs. Other states (e.g.,
California, Vermont and Nevada) have adopted similar laws. The Advanced Medical Technology Association (AdvaMed), a trade association representing the interests of medical device manufacturers, has also recently released a revised code of ethics
outlining permissible interactions with health care professionals. This code became effective July 1, 2009. These laws, regulations and guidance documents act to limit our marketing practices, require the dedication of resources to ensure
compliance, and expose us to additional liabilities.

In addition,
the recent Health Care Reform Law, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the
statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The Health Care Reform Law also provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of these statutes
constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute.

Any violations of these laws or regulations could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, changes in these laws, regulations, or administrative or judicial interpretations, may require us to further change our business practices or subject our existing business practices to legal challenges, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Properties.

The following is a summary of Cooper’s principal facilities as of
October 31, 2011. Cooper generally leases its office and operations facilities but owns several manufacturing and research and development facilities, including 205,850 square feet in Hamble, United Kingdom, 49,500 square feet in Scottsville,
New York, and 33,630 square feet in Stafford, Texas. Our lease agreements expire at various dates through the year 2030. The Company believes its properties are suitable and adequate for its businesses.



Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

Tax Matter

On April 1, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Notice of Deficiency to the Company in connection with its
audit of the Company’s income tax returns for the years 2005 and 2006. The Notice asserts that the Company is subject to additional taxes due to a proposed adjustment under the anti-deferral provisions of Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code.
If sustained, such taxes should be offset by the Company’s existing federal net operating loss carryforwards leaving a $1.2 million balance of proposed taxes owed. The Company intends to defend its positions taken in its income tax returns
vigorously. However, if the IRS’s contentions were sustained, the Company’s existing federal net operating loss carryforwards could be materially reduced, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s future net
income.

Patent Litigation

On April 28, 2011, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. filed a lawsuit
against CooperVision, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that CooperVision infringes U.S. Patent No. 5,712,327 entitled “Soft Gas Permeable Contact Lens Having Improved Clinical
Performance,” which was issued on January 28, 1998, to Sing-Hsiung Chang and Mei-Zyh Chang. The complaint alleged that CooperVision’s infringing conduct includes, but is not limited to, making, using, selling or offering to sell
silicone hydrogel contact lenses. The complaint sought an unspecified amount of damages, including treble damages, attorneys’ fees and costs and an injunction preventing any alleged infringement. On October 27, 2011, Rembrandt dismissed
its complaint in Texas and filed a complaint with the same allegations in the Middle District of Florida. On December 2, 2011, CooperVision and Rembrandt entered into a settlement of the litigation. Pursuant to the settlement agreement,
CooperVision agreed to make a single lump-sum payment of $10.0 million to Rembrandt, and Rembrandt granted a covenant not to sue under the ‘327 patent (and related domestic and foreign patents) to CooperVision and its suppliers, resellers,
marketing partners and certain related individuals and entities. The parties also exchanged releases relating to the claims asserted in the litigation. The case will be dismissed with prejudice as part of the settlement.

Securities Litigation

On November 28, 2011, Harold Greenberg filed a lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. C11-05697 PJH, against the following defendants: the Company; Robert S. Weiss, its President, Chief Executive Officer and a director; Eugene J. Midlock, its Senior Vice
President and Chief Financial Officer; and Albert G. White, III, its Vice President of Investor Relations, Treasurer and Chief Strategic Officer. Mr. Greenberg seeks to represent a class of persons who purchased the Company’s common stock
between March 4, 2011 and November 15, 2011.

The
lawsuit alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by, among other things, failing to disclose alleged problems at the Company’s manufacturing plants in Puerto Rico and the United
Kingdom, allegedly making material misstatements with an intent to deceive investors concerning the recall of the Company’s Avaira Toric and Avaira Sphere contact lenses and the expected financial impact of the recalls, and allegedly making
false projections of future financial results. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages.



The lawsuit has only recently been filed and there has been no discovery or other proceedings in the case.
Accordingly, the Company is not in a position to assess whether any loss or adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition is probable or remote or to estimate the range of potential loss, if any.

Item 4.

Submission of Matters to a
Vote of Security Holders.

During the fiscal
fourth quarter of 2011, the Company did not submit any matters to a vote of the Company’s security holders.

Item 5.

Market for
Registrant’s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters.

Cooper’s common stock, par value $0.10 per share, is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “COO.” In the table that follows, we indicate the high and low selling prices of
our common stock for each three-month period of 2011 and 2010:

At
November 30, 2011, there were 726 common stockholders of record.

Dividend Policy

Our current policy is to pay annual cash dividends on our common stock of $0.06 per share, in two semiannual payments of $0.03 per share each. In dollar terms, we paid cash for dividends of about
$2.8 million in fiscal 2011 and $2.7 million in fiscal 2010. Dividends are paid when, as and if declared at the discretion of our board of directors from funds legally available for that purpose. Our board of directors periodically reviews our
dividend policy and considers the Company’s earnings, financial condition, liquidity needs, business plans and opportunities and other factors in making and setting dividend policy.

THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Note numbers refer to the “Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements” in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

We discuss below the results of our operations for fiscal 2011 compared with fiscal 2010 and the results of our operations for fiscal 2010 compared with fiscal 2009. Certain prior period amounts have been
reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation. We discuss our cash flows and current financial condition under “Capital Resources and Liquidity.”

Outlook

Overall, we remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for the worldwide contact lens and women’s healthcare markets.
However, events affecting the economy as a whole, including the uncertainty and instability of global markets driven by employment, housing and credit concerns, the European debt crisis and the recent downgrade of long-term U.S. sovereign debt
continue to represent a risk to our forecasted performance for fiscal year 2012 and beyond.

We compete in the worldwide contact lens market with our spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses offered in a variety of materials including using phosphorylcholine (PC) Technology

™

and silicone hydrogel Aquaform

®

technology. We believe that there will be lower contact lens wearer dropout rates as technology improves and enhances the wearing experience through a combination of
improved designs and materials and the growth of preferred modalities such as single-use and monthly wearing options. CooperVision is focused on greater worldwide market penetration as we roll out new products and continue to expand our presence in
existing and emerging markets.

Sales of
contact lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel materials, a major product material in the industry, have grown significantly. In the past three years, CooperVision launched monthly silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and multifocal lens products under
our Biofinity

brand and two-week silicone hydrogel spherical and toric lens products under our Avaira brand. In
fiscal 2011, we launched our Biofinity spherical silicone hydrogel lens in Japan and our Biofinity multifocal lens globally. While we believe that we have high quality silicone hydrogel contact lens products, our future growth may be limited by our
late entry into the silicone hydrogel segment of the market. For example, competitive silicone hydrogel single-use and multifocal lens products are gaining market share and represent a risk to our business. We have not yet marketed a silicone
hydrogel single-use product. Our ability to compete successfully with a full range of silicone hydrogel products is an important factor to achieving our projected future levels of sales growth and profitability.

In August 2011, CooperVision initiated a recall on limited lots of Avaira
Toric contact lenses. In November 2011, this recall was expanded to cover limited lots of Avaira Sphere contact lenses. The recall was initiated because of the level of a residue (silicone oil) on certain lenses. The residue may cause hazy vision,
severe eye pain or an eye injury. The manufacturing issue has been identified and process changes have been implemented. These process changes are subject to review by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Avaira Toric and Avaira Sphere
lenses that are subject to the

recall represent less than 2% of the Company’s fiscal 2011 net sales. Avaira Sphere lenses remain on the market, while Avaira Toric lenses are awaiting FDA authorization to return to the
market. This recall is limited solely to specific lots of Avaira Toric and Avaira Sphere contact lenses and no other CooperVision products are involved in this recall.

We are also in the process of developing a number of new
contact lens products to enhance CooperVision’s worldwide product lines. New products planned for introduction over the next two years include additional lenses utilizing silicone hydrogel and PC Technology

materials and new lens designs, including multifocal and single-use silicone hydrogel lenses.

The medical device segment of the women’s healthcare
market is highly fragmented. CooperSurgical has steadily grown its market presence and distribution system by developing products and acquiring products and companies that complement its business model. In fiscal 2011, CooperSurgical acquired Apple
Medical, gaining its products including the OB/Mobius

®

Elastic Retractor used in cesarean sections, the Fischer
Cone Biopsy Excisor

™

used for cervical biopsies and the Apple-Hunt Secondary Trocar

™

used in laparoscopic surgical procedures. CooperSurgical also acquired Summit Doppler Systems, Inc., gaining its
hand-held obstetrical and vascular ultrasound doppler systems used for peripheral vascular testing and fetal monitoring applications. We intend to continue to invest in CooperSurgical’s business through acquisitions of companies and product
lines.

In the fiscal first quarter of 2011, we refinanced our
syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit due to mature on January 31, 2012, with a new Credit Agreement that provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million and an amortizing
term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $250.0 million, each of which, mature on January 12, 2016. On February 15, 2011, we redeemed all $339.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our Senior Notes, in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture, from borrowings under the new Credit Agreement, including $250.0 million from the term loan facility. At October 31, 2011, we had $650.7 million available under the Credit Agreement. We believe
that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operating activities and borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities will fund operations both in the next 12 months and in the longer term as well as current and long-term cash requirements
for capital expenditures, acquisitions and cash dividends.

CooperVision Net Sales

The contact lens market has two major product categories:

•

Spherical lenses including lenses that correct near- and farsightedness uncomplicated by more complex visual defects.

•

Toric and multifocal lenses including lenses that, in addition to correcting near- and farsightedness, address more complex visual defects such as
astigmatism and presbyopia by adding optical properties of cylinder and axis, which correct for irregularities in the shape of the cornea.

In order to achieve comfortable and healthy contact lens wear, products are sold with recommended replacement schedules, often defined as modalities, with
the primary modalities being single-use, two-week and monthly. CooperVision offers spherical, aspherical, toric, multifocal and toric multifocal lens products in most modalities.

The contact lens market consists primarily of disposable and frequently
replaced lenses. Disposable lenses are designed for either daily, two-week or monthly replacement; frequently replaced lenses are designed for replacement after one to three months. Significantly, the market for spherical lenses is growing with
value-added spherical lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms as well as lenses with aspherical optical properties or higher oxygen permeable lenses such as silicone hydrogels.

CooperVision’s Proclear

brand aspheric, toric and multifocal contact lenses, manufactured using proprietary phosphorylcholine (PC)
Technology, help enhance tissue/device compatibility and offer improved lens comfort.

CooperVision’s Biofinity brand silicone hydrogel spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses and Avaira brand spherical and toric products are manufactured using proprietary Aquaform technology to
increase oxygen transmissibility for longer wear. We believe that it is important to develop a full range of multifocal and single-use silicone hydrogel products due to increased pressure from silicone hydrogel products offered by our major
competitors.

Net sales growth includes increases in single-use
spheres up 18% and total spheres up 12%. Total toric lenses grew 16%, including 26% growth of single-use toric lenses, and multifocal lenses grew 4%. Silicone hydrogel products grew 49% worldwide. Proclear products increased 10% driven by growth of
single-use lenses. Older conventional lens products and cosmetic lenses declined 13% and 17%, respectively.

CooperVision competes in the worldwide soft contact lens market and services three primary regions: the Americas, EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific.

CooperVision Net Sales by Region

CooperVision’s worldwide net sales grew
16% in the period-to-period comparison. Americas net sales grew 9%, primarily due to market gains of CooperVision’s silicone hydrogel contact lenses and single-use lenses. In our fiscal first quarter of 2010, we recorded $10.1 million of
reductions to Americas net sales due to out-of-period adjustments to increase accruals for rebates that were under-accrued in fiscal 2009. EMEA net sales grew 13% driven by increases in sales of silicone hydrogel lenses and single-use lenses. Net
sales to the Asia Pacific region grew 36%, primarily due to sales growth of single-use spherical and toric products and silicone hydrogel lenses; these results include sales of $31.3 million related to product lines acquired on December 1, 2010
from Asahikasei Aime Co., Ltd.

CooperVision’s net sales
growth is driven primarily by increases in the volume of lenses sold and introduction of new products, primarily silicone hydrogel lenses, along with acquisitions and the favorable effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. While unit
growth and product mix have influenced CooperVision’s sales growth, average realized prices by product have not materially influenced sales growth.

CooperSurgical Net Sales

CooperSurgical’s fiscal 2011 net sales increased 12% from fiscal 2010 to $209.7 million with net sales growth excluding acquisitions of 8%. Sales of
products used in surgical procedures grew 23% and represented 37% of CooperSurgical’s fiscal 2011 net sales compared to 33% in the prior fiscal year. CooperSurgical sales are primarily comprised of women’s healthcare products used by
gynecologists and obstetricians in both office and surgical procedures. The balance consists of sales of medical devices outside of women’s healthcare which CooperSurgical does not actively market. Unit growth and product mix along with
increased average realized prices on disposable products influenced organic sales growth.

The increases in CooperVision’s gross
margin are largely attributable to improvements in manufacturing efficiencies and product mix, primarily the shift to higher margin silicone hydrogel products. CooperVision’s gross margin in the current year was negatively impacted by the $20.2
million reserve for inventory and return provisions related to the recall of certain lots of Avaira contact lenses discussed above. Gross margin also reflects efficiencies associated with the 2009 CooperVision Manufacturing restructuring plan. Costs
associated with the plan, recorded as cost of sales, were $1.9 million for fiscal 2011, $16.0 million for fiscal 2010 and $5.0 million for fiscal 2009. As discussed below, these costs are primarily severance charges and accelerated
depreciation, and we do not expect to incur similar costs related to this manufacturing restructuring plan in future periods. Gross margin for fiscal 2010 reflects the increase in accruals for rebates discussed above. Gross margin in fiscal 2009
included costs associated with fixed asset write offs; such costs were not significant in fiscal 2011 or 2010.

The increase in CooperSurgical’s gross margin for fiscal 2011 is largely attributable to manufacturing efficiency improvements and product mix including higher margins on products used in surgical

procedures that represented 37% of net sales in fiscal 2011 compared to 33% in fiscal 2010 and 31% in fiscal 2009. CooperSurgical’s gross margin in fiscal 2010 includes the recognition of a
one-time $1.5 million favorable settlement resolving a vendor dispute.

Selling, General and Administrative Expense (SGA)

Consolidated SGA increased 18% in fiscal 2011
and 11% in fiscal 2010.

The 20% increase in CooperVision’s
SGA in fiscal 2011 in absolute dollars as well as the increase as a percentage of net sales are primarily due to our increased investment in sales and marketing to reach new customers and to promote our silicone hydrogel products as well as the
patent infringement settlement discussed below.

The 15% increase
in CooperSurgical’s SGA in fiscal 2011 in absolute dollars as well as the increase as a percentage of sales are primarily due to increased selling and marketing costs to support higher sales and anticipated further growth along with legal
expenses related to business acquisitions during the period.

Corporate headquarters’ SGA increased 14% in fiscal 2011 primarily due to increased legal costs and share-based compensation expense partially offset
by reduced consulting fees.

technology products as well as products within the general obstetrics and gynecology offerings.

Restructuring Costs

2009 CooperVision Manufacturing Restructuring Plan

In the fiscal third quarter of 2009, CooperVision initiated a restructuring plan to relocate contact lens manufacturing from Norfolk, Virginia, and transfer part of its contact lens manufacturing from
Adelaide, Australia, to existing manufacturing operations in Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico, and Hamble, UK (2009 CooperVision Manufacturing restructuring plan). This plan is intended to better utilize CooperVision’s manufacturing efficiencies and
reduce its manufacturing expenses through a reduction in workforce of approximately 480 employees.

CooperVision completed restructuring activities in Adelaide in our fiscal third quarter of 2010 and in Norfolk in our fiscal first quarter of 2011.

The total restructuring costs under this plan were approximately $23.1 million, with $15.4 million associated with assets,
including accelerated depreciation and facility lease and contract termination costs, and $7.7 million associated with employee benefit costs, including severance payments, termination benefit costs, retention bonus payouts and other similar costs.
These costs were reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

In fiscal 2011, $1.9 million, including $0.8 million of employee benefit costs and $1.1 million of costs associated with assets, primarily non-cash, were reported in cost of sales. In fiscal
2010, $16.1 million, including $3.3 million of employee benefit costs and $12.8 million of costs associated with assets, primarily non-cash, were reported as $16.0 million in cost of sales and $0.1 million in restructuring costs. In fiscal
2009, $5.1 million including $3.6 million of employee benefit costs and $1.5 million of non-cash costs associated with assets were reported as $5.0 million in cost of sales and $0.1 million in restructuring costs.

The Company may, from time to time, decide to pursue additional restructuring
activities that involve charges in future periods.

Amortization of Intangibles

Amortization of intangibles was $20.5 million in fiscal 2011, $18.1 million in fiscal 2010 and $17.9 million in fiscal 2009. Amortization expense in
fiscal 2009 includes a $1.5 million charge for a CooperSurgical license that no longer had value.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

Operating Income

Operating income grew $77.7 million, or 52%, between fiscal 2009 and fiscal
2011, increasing $37.7 million or 20% in fiscal 2011 from fiscal 2010 and $40.0 million or 27% in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009.

The increase in consolidated operating income
in fiscal 2011 both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of 19%, partially offset by increases in operating expenses of 19%, the Avaira recall discussed above and the settlement with
Rembrandt discussed below.

Interest Expense

Interest expense decreased 53% to $17.3 million in 2011 constituting 1% of
net sales in fiscal 2011 as compared to 3% of net sales in the fiscal 2010. The fiscal 2011 decrease reflects lower interest rates primarily as a result of the redemption of our Senior Notes in February 2011 and lower average debt in the current
period. Interest expense decreased 17% to $36.7 million in fiscal 2010 and decreased 17% to $44.1 million in 2009. The fiscal 2010 and 2009 decreases primarily reflect reduced long-term borrowings used for capital expenditures and lower interest
rates. We had $339.7 million in loans on our Credit Agreement at October 31, 2011, compared to $591.8 million at October 31, 2010.

Extinguishment of Debt

In February 2011, we redeemed all $339.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our Senior Notes issued on January 31, 2007. In
accordance with the Indenture, the redemption price for the Notes was 103.563% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to February 15, 2011, the redemption date. In our fiscal second quarter of 2011, we recorded a $16.5
million loss on the repurchase that includes the write-off of approximately $4.4 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of $12.1 million related to the Senior Notes in our Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company paid the
aggregate purchase price from borrowings under its new Credit Agreement, including $250.0 million from the term loan facility.

In December 2008, we purchased through the open market, in a privately negotiated transaction, $11.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our
7.125% Senior Notes at a discounted price of approximately $9.0 million plus accrued and unpaid interest. We also wrote off approximately $0.2 million of unamortized costs related to the Senior Notes and recorded the $1.8 million gain on the
repurchase in other income in our Consolidated Statement of Income.

Settlements

On December 2, 2011, CooperVision and Rembrandt Vision Technologies,
L.P. entered into a settlement agreement whereby CooperVision agreed to make a lump sum payment of $10.0 million to Rembrandt, and Rembrandt granted a covenant not to sue regarding patent infringement claims. The Company recorded a charge for the
settlement in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2011.

The Company and
several of its directors and officers had been named in a consolidated securities class action lawsuit, the nature and status of which is described in Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies. The Company announced on May 4, 2010, that it
reached an agreement in principle and recorded a charge in our fiscal second quarter of 2010 to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit for $27.0 million, which we funded into escrow in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. The Court granted
final approval of the proposed settlement on December 13, 2010.

The Company also was a nominal defendant in shareholder derivative litigation against several current and former officers and directors of the Company. The Company reached a settlement agreement to pay
attorney’s fees of counsel to the plaintiff’s in the amount of $750 thousand. The Company recorded a charge for the settlement amount in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010.

The fiscal 2009 foreign exchange net gain is

Provision for Income Taxes

We recorded income tax expense of $17.3 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $11.6 million in fiscal 2010. Cooper’s effective tax rate (ETR) (provision
for income taxes divided by pretax income) for both fiscal 2011 and 2010 was about 9%.

The ETR is below the United States statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates reflecting the shift in the geographic mix of income during recent
periods with income earned in foreign jurisdictions increasing as compared to income earned in the United States. As a result, the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income primarily within CooperVision has decreased over recent fiscal periods. A
reduction in the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where the Company operates are significantly lower than the statutory
rate in the United States. The completion of the Company’s restructuring plan to close a CooperVision manufacturing facility, located in Norfolk, Virginia, with the manufacturing demand subsequently



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

absorbed by our plants in the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico contributed to this change in the geographic mix of income. As a result of this restructuring, substantially all of
CooperVision’s contact lens products are manufactured outside of the United States.

Additionally, in fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a $16.5 million domestic loss on the repurchase of its Senior Notes that included the write off of about $4.4 million of unamortized costs and the
redemption premium of $12.1 million. This impacted the Company’s tax provision and further reduced the overall effective tax rate.

Share-Based Compensation Plans

The Company grants various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance shares, restricted stock and restricted stock units. The
share-based compensation and related income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2011 was $14.7 million and $4.4 million, respectively, compared to $10.2 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in
fiscal 2010. As of October 31, 2011, there was $32.4 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation cost related to non-vested awards: $7.2 million for stock options; $19.0 million for restricted stock units; and $6.2 million
for performance shares. The unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over weighted average remaining vesting periods of 2.7 years for nonvested stock options, 2.9 years for restricted stock units and 1.8 years for performance shares.
Cash received from options exercised under all share-based compensation arrangements for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $82.0 million, $11.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

The Company estimates the fair value of each stock option award on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes valuation model, which requires management to make estimates regarding expected option life, stock price volatility and other assumptions. The use of different assumptions could lead to a different estimate of fair
value. The expected life of the stock option is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes.
If our assumption for the expected life increased by one year, the fair value of an individual option granted in fiscal 2011 would have increased by approximately $1.50. To determine the stock price volatility, management considers implied
volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company’s stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. If our assumption for stock price volatility increased by one percentage point, the fair value of an individual option
granted in fiscal 2011 would have increased by less than $1.

The
Company estimates stock option forfeitures based on historical data for each employee grouping, and adjusts the rate to expected forfeitures periodically. The adjustment of the forfeiture rate will result in a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the
period the forfeiture estimate is changed. These adjustments totaled $1.9 million, $1.2 million and $2.9 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company grants performance units that provide for the issuance of common
stock to certain executive officers if the Company achieves specified long-term performance goals over a three-year period. The Company estimates the fair value of each award on the date of grant based on the current



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

market price of our common stock. The total amount of compensation expense recognized reflects our initial assumptions of the achievement of the performance goals and the estimated forfeiture
rates. The Company reviews our assessment of the probability of the achievement of the performance goals each fiscal quarter. If achievement of the goals are not met or it is determined that achievement of the goals is not probable, previously
recognized compensation expense is adjusted prospectively to reflect the expected achievement. If we determine that achievement of the goals will exceed the original assessment, additional compensation expense is recognized prospectively.

Comparative Statistics

Working Capital

The decrease in working capital at the end of fiscal 2011 from the end of
fiscal 2010 was primarily due to increases in accounts payable, other accrued liabilities, including the charge related to the Rembrandt settlement, and short-term debt including the portion of the term loan which became current during the fiscal
year. This decrease was partially offset by increases in trade accounts receivable, inventory and a decrease in accrued interest payable. The decrease in accrued interest payable was due to lower interest rates primarily as a result of the
redemption of our Senior Notes in February 2011, lower average outstanding debt and the timing of interest payments.

The increases in trade accounts receivable and inventory were primarily due to the growth in sales and to production to support new product launches. At
October 31, 2011, Cooper’s inventory months on hand (MOH) were 5.9, excluding the reserves for inventory related to the recall of certain lots of

decreased to 55 days in fiscal 2011 from 57 days in the prior fiscal year. Based on our experience and knowledge of our customers and our analysis of inventoried products and product levels, we believe that our reported accounts receivable and
inventories are recoverable.

The Company has reviewed its needs
in the United States for possible repatriation of undistributed earnings or cash of its foreign subsidiaries. The Company presently intends to continue to indefinitely invest all earnings and cash outside of the United States of all foreign
subsidiaries to fund foreign investments or meet foreign working capital and property, plant and equipment requirements.

Operating Cash Flow

Cash flow provided by operating activities continued in fiscal 2011 as Cooper’s major source of liquidity, increasing to $336.3 million from $267.7
million in fiscal 2010 and $223.1 million in fiscal 2009. The $68.6 million increase in cash flow provided by operations from fiscal 2010 to fiscal 2011 is primarily due to the increase in net income of $62.6 million. Fiscal 2011 results include
$175.4 million of net income, $114.8 million of non-cash items primarily related to depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and currency translation and $16.5 million for the loss on extinguishment of debt. Results also include $29.6
million from the net changes in assets and liabilities.

For
fiscal 2011, our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products totaling $1.3 billion. Our uses of cash flows provided by operating activities included $939.4
million used primarily for personnel and material costs and cash payments of $25.6 million and $12.2 million for interest and income tax, respectively.

For fiscal 2010, our primary source of cash flows provided by operating activities was cash collections from our customers for purchase of our products
totaling $1.1 billion. Our primary uses of cash flows from operating activities included $819.0 million used for personnel and material costs and cash payments of $36.7 million and $8.6 million for interest and income tax, respectively.

Investing Cash Flow

Cash used in investing activities of $161.7 million in fiscal 2011 was for
capital expenditures of $103.7 million, primarily to improve manufacturing efficiency, and payments of $58.0 million related to acquisitions.

Cash used in investing activities of $106.6 million in fiscal 2010 was for capital expenditures of $73.8 million primarily to improve manufacturing
capacity and payments of $32.8 million related to acquisitions.

Financing Cash Flow

The changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to borrowings and payments of debt as well as proceeds from share-based compensation
award exercises and dividend payments. Cash

used in financing activities of $172.9 million in fiscal 2011 was driven by net repayments of debt of $242.8 million, including the redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes and the related
redemption premium, acquisition costs related to the Credit Agreement of $9.6 million, a $2.6 million payment for contingent consideration and dividends paid on our common stock of $2.8 million, offset by proceeds of $82.0 million from the
exercise of share-based compensation awards and $2.9 million for the excess tax benefit from share-based compensation arrangements.

Cash used in financing activities of $161.6 million in fiscal 2010 was driven by net repayments of long-term debt of $182.5 million, including the capital
lease, and dividends paid on our common stock of $2.7 million, offset by proceeds from short-term debt of $12.1 million and $11.5 million from the exercise of share-based compensation awards and related tax benefit.

At October 31, 2011, we had $650.7 million available under the Credit
Agreement, and we are in compliance with the covenants including the Interest Coverage Ratio and Total Leverage Ratio at 21.42 to 1.00 versus the requirement to be at least 3.00 to 1.00 and 1.03 to 1.00 versus the requirement to remain below 3.75 to
1.00, respectively. As defined in the Credit Agreement, the Interest Coverage Ratio is the ratio of Consolidated Proforma EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense and the Total Leverage Ratio is the ratio of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to
Consolidated Proforma EBITDA.

Risk Management

We operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture and market our
products worldwide. As a result, our earnings, cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, sales transactions, capital expenditures and net investment in certain
foreign operations. We are exposed to risks caused by changes in foreign exchange, primarily to the British pound, euro, Japanese yen, Swedish krona, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. Our policy is to minimize, to the extent reasonable and
practical, transaction, remeasurement and specified economic exposures with derivatives instruments. Although we may enter into foreign exchange agreements with financial institutions to reduce our nonfunctional currency exposure, these hedging
transactions do not eliminate that risk entirely. We are also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest rates, as the interest rate on our Credit Agreement may vary with the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). We have decreased this
interest rate risk by hedging a significant portion of variable rate debt effectively converting it to fixed rate debt for varying periods through December 2014. For additional detail, see Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 1 and Note 10 to the
consolidated financial statements.

In the fiscal first quarter of
2011, we refinanced our syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit due to mature on January 31, 2012, with a new Credit Agreement that provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of
$750.0 million and an amortizing term loan facility with an original principal amount of $250.0 million, each of which, mature on January 12, 2016. On February 15, 2011, we redeemed all $339.0 million aggregate principal amount
outstanding of our Senior Notes, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, from borrowings under the new Credit Agreement, including $250.0 million from the term loan facility.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMERCIAL COMMITMENTS

As of October 31, 2011, we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments:

The expected future benefit payments for
pension plans through 2021 are disclosed in Note 9. Employee Benefits.

We are unable to reliably estimate the timing of future payments related to uncertain tax positions; therefore, such amounts of our long-term income taxes payable have been excluded from the table above.
However, other long-term liabilities, included in our consolidated balance sheet, included these uncertain tax positions. For additional information, please see Note 5. Income Taxes.

Inflation and Changing Prices

Inflation has had no appreciable effect on our operations in the last three fiscal years.

New Accounting Pronouncements

On November 1, 2010, the Company adopted portions of the Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2010-6,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures:
Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements,

which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820,

Fair Value Measurements

. This ASU added new requirements for disclosures about (1) the different classes of assets and
liabilities measured at fair value, (2) the valuation techniques and inputs used, (3) the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements and (4) the transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements. The requirement to provide
the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis will be effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires enhanced disclosures, as applicable, its
adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2010-29,

Business
Combinations: Disclosure of Supplementary Proforma Information for Business Combinations,

which amends ASC 805,

Business Combinations

. The amendments in this ASU affect any public entity as defined by ASC 805 that enters into business
combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. The amendments in this ASU specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as
though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The amendments also expand the supplemental proforma disclosures to include a description
of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring proforma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported proforma revenue and earnings. The amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations
for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2010-29, which is
effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2011, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28,

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other: When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test
for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying Amounts

, which amends ASC 350,

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other

. The amendments in this ASU modify Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative
carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that an
impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The qualitative factors are consistent with the existing guidance and examples, which require that goodwill of a
reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company does not anticipate the adoption
of ASU 2010-28, which is effective for the Company on November 1, 2011, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is not permitted.

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04,

Amendments to Achieve Common
Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs,

which amends ASC 820

, Fair Value Measurement.

This ASU represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (the Boards)
on fair value measurement. The amendments (1) clarify the Boards’ intent regarding the application of existing fair value measurement guidance, (2) revise certain measurement guidance that changes or modifies a principle and
(3) add disclosure requirements concerning the measurement uncertainty of level 3 measurements. The Boards concluded that the common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in
financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendments are effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and are to be applied prospectively.
Early application is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2011-04, which is effective for the Company on November 1, 2012, on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05,

Presentation of Comprehensive Income.

This ASU, which
amends ASC 220,

Comprehensive Income

, allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of
comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both options, an entity is required to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other
comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The amendments do not
change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. The amendments made by ASU 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively and become effective for
fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2011-05, which is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning
on November 1, 2012, will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment

. ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine
whether it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test as described in ASC 350,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other

. The ASU defines the more-likely-than-not threshold as having a likelihood of more than 50%. Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless
the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU, which is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2012, will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies

Management estimates and judgments are an integral part of financial
statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more significant estimates required of
management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We
believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future periods.

•

Revenue recognition – We recognize product net sales, net of discounts, returns, and rebates in accordance with related accounting standards and
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins. As required by these standards, we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the
seller’s price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For contact

lenses as well as CooperSurgical medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this primarily occurs when title and risk of ownership transfers to our customers.
We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical statistics, estimated reductions to revenue for customer incentive
programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs. The Company records taxes collected from
customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in net sales.

•

Allowance for doubtful accounts – Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate
of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual
customers. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer
base, well established historical payment patterns and the consistent healthcare needs of patients regardless of the economic environment.

•

Net realizable value of inventory – In assessing the value of inventories, we make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and
other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other
indications of salability. We reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market, resulting in a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result
in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on
average, five to seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our contact lens and women’s healthcare product portfolios.

•

Valuation of goodwill – We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with related
accounting standards. We performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2011, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an
event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist.

The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting
unit that has goodwill assigned to it. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for
impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our business segments – CooperVision and CooperSurgical – reflecting the way that we manage our business.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and

Results of Operations – (Continued)

The fair value of our reporting units was determined using the income valuation
approach. Under the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining
life.

In the application of the income approach,
the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. Actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates. Discount rates are based on a weighted
average cost of capital, which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital. We used discount rates that are the representative weighted average cost of capital for each of our reporting units, with
consideration given to the current condition of the global economy. The discount rates used in the current year are about 100 basis points lower than those used in our analysis for fiscal year 2010 reflecting the current condition of the United
States and global economy. The Company determines net sales forecasts based on our best estimate of near-term net sales expectations and long-term projections which include review of published independent industry analyst reports. As a sensitivity
analysis, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed net sales growth beginning in fiscal 2011 and extending through the valuation period would decrease the excess amount of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit over the carrying value but
would not cause a change in the results of our impairment testing that indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill.

Goodwill impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. If our common stock price trades below book
value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or a future annual goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, the Company may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of its
goodwill that could be material, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also adversely affect our total assets, stockholders’ equity and financial condition.

•

Business combinations – We routinely consummate business combinations. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our
consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Based on the FASB revision to the accounting standard for business combinations, we recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process
research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree generally at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. As of the acquisition date,
goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Direct acquisition costs are expensed as
incurred.

During the fiscal
third quarter of 2011, we recorded an out-of-period adjustment related to CooperVision’s acquisition of certain assets of Asahikasei Aime Co., Ltd. (Aime), reported in our fiscal first quarter of 2011, to reduce the amount of recorded goodwill
and reverse the $6.1 million gain on settlement of preexisting relationship. The Company determined that it incorrectly applied the guidance in ASC 805,

Business Combinations

, relating to the settlement of preexisting relationships due to our
interpretation of specific language in the underlying contract. Based upon an evaluation of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, and after considering the

provisions of ASC 270-10-45-16,

, that incorporates SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB)
No. 99,

Materiality

, and SAB No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

, we do not believe that the effect of the out-of-period adjustment
is material to our fiscal year 2011 financial results. We also do not believe that the out-of-period adjustment is material to any previously issued quarterly consolidated financial statements. Based on this assessment of materiality, the
out-of-period adjustment was recorded in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal third quarter of 2011. There is no impact on our fiscal year results as the error and its correction were both recorded in the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2011.

•

Income taxes – We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

As part of the process of
preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax exposures in
each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of
future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate future estimates.
To determine the tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are identified. Changes
in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material.

Regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that
the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. We measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized, assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax
benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the interpretation of ASC 740,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The interpretation also
provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our Consolidated Statement of Income and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We classify interest and penalties related to
uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense.

Share-Based Compensation – The Company grants various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance unit shares,
restricted stock and restricted stock units. Under fair value recognition provisions, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period.
Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating Cooper’s stock price volatility, employee exercise behaviors and related employee forfeiture rates.

The expected life of the share-based awards is based on the
observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. In determining the expected volatility, management considers
implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company’s stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term equal
to the expected life of the award. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant.

As share-based compensation expense recognized in our
Consolidated Statements of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on historical experience, and revised, if
necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

If factors change and the Company employs different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions, the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ
significantly from what it has recorded in the current period.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market
Risk.

Note numbers refer to the “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

The Company is exposed to market risks that relate principally to changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations. The Company’s policy is to minimize, to the extent reasonable and
practical, its exposure to the impact of changing interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations by entering into interest rate swaps and foreign currency forward exchange contracts, respectively. The Company does not enter into derivative
financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes. For additional information please see Risk Management discussed above in Capital Resources and Liquidity and Item 1A. Risk Factors and Note 1 and Note 10 to the consolidated financial

Long-term Debt

Total debt decreased to $380.4 million at October 31, 2011 from $611.1
million at October 31, 2010. On January 12, 2011, Cooper refinanced its existing syndicated Senior Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit with a new Credit Agreement that provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate
principal amount of $750.0 million and an amortizing term loan facility in an original principal amount of $250.0 million, each of which, unless terminated earlier, mature on January 12, 2016. In addition, the Company has the ability from time
to time to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional $250.0 million.

In February 2011, we redeemed all $339.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Senior Notes issued on January 31, 2007, in accordance with the terms of the Indenture among the
Company, the guarantors party thereto and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as trustee, pursuant to which the Senior Notes were issued. In accordance with the Indenture, the redemption price for the Notes was 103.563% of their principal amount
plus accrued and unpaid interest to February 15, 2011, the redemption date. In our fiscal second quarter of 2011, we recorded a $16.5 million loss on the repurchase that includes the write-off of about $4.4 million of unamortized costs and the
redemption premium of $12.1 million related to the Senior Notes on our Consolidated Statement of Income. The Company paid the aggregate purchase price from borrowings under the new Credit Agreement, including $250.0 million from the term loan
facility. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further information about the Company’s debt.

At October 31, 2011, the scheduled maturities of the Company’s fixed and variable rate long-term
debt obligations, their weighted average interest rates and their estimated fair values were as follows:

As the table incorporates only those
exposures that existed as of October 31, 2011, it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on
interest rates, the exposures that arise during the period and our hedging strategies at that time. As of October 31, 2011, the Company has interest rate swaps outstanding that are designed to fix the borrowing costs related to $200.0 million
of the outstanding balance on the Company’s amortizing term loan under the Credit Agreement. If interest rates were to increase or decrease by 1% or 100 basis points, annual interest expense would increase or decrease by about
$1.4 million.



Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data.

Report of Independent Registered Public
Accounting Firm

The Board
of Directors and Stockholders

The Cooper Companies, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Cooper
Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended October 31, 2011. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2011, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and
whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also
included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets
that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Cooper Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
period ended October 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, The Cooper Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

General

The Cooper Companies, Inc. (Cooper or the Company) is a global medical
device company publicly traded on the NYSE Euronext (NYSE:COO). Cooper is dedicated to serving the needs of the healthcare professional, improving the quality of life for its employees and customers and providing competitive products. Cooper
operates through two business units, CooperVision and CooperSurgical.

•

CooperVision produces a broad range of monthly, two-week and single-use contact lenses, featuring advanced materials and optics. CooperVision brings a
commitment to solving the toughest vision challenges such as astigmatism, presbyopia and ocular dryness; with a broad collection of spherical, toric and multifocal contact lenses.

•

CooperSurgical develops, manufactures and markets medical devices and procedure solutions to improve healthcare delivery to women regardless of the
clinical setting.

Estimates and Critical
Accounting Policies

Management estimates and judgments are
an integral part of financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). We believe that the critical accounting policies described in this section address the more
significant estimates required of management when preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. We consider an accounting estimate critical if changes in the estimate may have a material impact on our financial condition
or results of operations. We believe that the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustment to these balances in future
periods.

•

Revenue recognition – We recognize product net sales, net of discounts, returns, and rebates in accordance with related accounting standards and
SEC Staff Accounting Bulletins. As required by these standards, we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned, based on terms of sale with the customer, where persuasive evidence of an agreement exists, delivery has occurred, the
seller’s price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. For contact lenses as well as CooperSurgical medical devices, diagnostic products and surgical instruments and accessories, this primarily occurs when title and
risk of ownership transfers to our customers. We believe our revenue recognition policies are appropriate in all circumstances, and that our policies are reflective of our customer arrangements. We record, based on historical statistics, estimated
reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash discounts, promotional and advertising allowances, volume discounts, contractual pricing allowances, rebates and specifically established customer product return programs.
The Company records taxes collected from customers on a net basis, as these taxes are not included in net sales.

•

Allowance for doubtful accounts – Our reported balance of accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents our estimate
of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash. We review the adequacy and adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis, using historical payment trends and the age of the receivables and knowledge of our individual
customers. However, if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, additional allowances may



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

be required. While estimates are involved, bad debts historically have not been a significant factor given the diversity of our customer base, well established historical payment patterns and the
consistent healthcare needs of patients regardless of the economic environment.

•

Net realizable value of inventory – In assessing the value of inventories, we make estimates and judgments regarding aging of inventories and
other relevant issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products and estimated prices at which those products will sell. On an ongoing basis, we review the carrying value of our inventory, measuring number of months on hand and other
indications of salability. We reduce the value of inventory if there are indications that the carrying value is greater than market, resulting in a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory. Subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result
in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. While estimates are involved, historically, obsolescence has not been a significant factor due to long product dating and lengthy product life cycles. We target to keep, on
average, five to seven months of inventory on hand to maintain high customer service levels given the complexity of our contact lens and women’s healthcare product portfolios.

•

Valuation of goodwill – We account for goodwill and evaluate our goodwill balances and test them for impairment in accordance with related
accounting standards. We performed our annual impairment test in our fiscal third quarter of 2011, and our analysis indicated that we had no impairment of goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually during the fiscal third quarter and when an
event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist.

The goodwill impairment test is a two-step process. Initially, we compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of each reporting
unit that has goodwill assigned to it. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. A reporting unit is the level of reporting at which goodwill is tested for
impairment. Our reporting units are the same as our business segments – CooperVision and CooperSurgical – reflecting the way that we manage our business.

The fair value of our reporting units was determined using
the income valuation approach. Under the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow method, the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate
over its remaining life.

In the application of
the income approach, the Company is required to make estimates of future operating trends and judgments on discount rates and other variables. Actual future results related to assumed variables could differ from these estimates. Discount rates are
based on a weighted average cost of capital, which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity capital. We used discount rates that are the representative weighted average cost of capital for each of our
reporting units, with consideration given to the current condition of the global economy. The discount rates used in the current year are about 100 basis points lower than those used in our analysis for fiscal year 2010 reflecting the current
condition of the United States and global economy. The Company determines net sales forecasts based on our best estimate of near-term net sales expectations and long-term projections which include review of published independent industry analyst
reports. As a sensitivity analysis, a 100 basis point reduction in the assumed net sales growth beginning in fiscal 2011 and extending through the valuation period



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

would decrease the excess amount of the estimated fair value of each reporting unit over the carrying value but would not cause a change in the results of our impairment testing that indicated
that we had no impairment of goodwill.

Goodwill
impairment analysis and measurement is a process that requires significant judgment. If our common stock price trades below book value per share, there are changes in market conditions or a future downturn in our business, or a future annual
goodwill impairment test indicates an impairment of our goodwill, the Company may have to recognize a non-cash impairment of its goodwill that could be material, and could adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized and also
adversely affect our total assets, stockholders’ equity and financial condition.

•

Business combinations – We routinely consummate business combinations. Results of operations for acquired companies are included in our
consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. Based on the FASB revision to the accounting standard for business combinations, we recognize separately from goodwill, the identifiable assets acquired, including acquired in-process
research and development, the liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree generally at the acquisition date fair values as defined by accounting standards related to fair value measurements. As of the acquisition date,
goodwill is measured as the excess of consideration given, generally measured at fair value, and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Direct acquisition costs are expensed as
incurred.

During the fiscal
third quarter of 2011, we recorded an out-of-period adjustment related to CooperVision’s acquisition of certain assets of Asahikasei Aime Co., Ltd. (Aime), reported in our fiscal first quarter of 2011, to reduce the amount of recorded goodwill
and reverse the $6.1 million gain on settlement of preexisting relationship. The Company determined that it incorrectly applied the guidance in ASC 805,

Business Combinations

, relating to the settlement of preexisting relationships due to our
interpretation of specific language in the underlying contract. Based upon an evaluation of all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors, and after considering the provisions of ASC 270-10-45-16,

Accounting Changes in Interim Periods

,
and ASC 250,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

, that incorporates SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 99,

Materiality

, and SAB No. 108,

Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

, we do not believe that the effect of the out-of-period adjustment is material to our fiscal year 2011 financial results. We also do not believe that the out-of-period adjustment is material to
any previously issued quarterly consolidated financial statements. Based on this assessment of materiality, the out-of-period adjustment was recorded in our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal third quarter of 2011. There is no impact
on our fiscal year results as the error and its correction were both recorded in the fiscal year ended October 31, 2011.

•

Income taxes – We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future
tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and for tax losses and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized
in income in the period that includes



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

the enactment date. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.

As part of the
process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we must estimate our income tax expense for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This process requires significant management judgments and involves estimating our current tax
exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact, if any, of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations as well as judging the recoverability of deferred tax assets. To the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our
estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction, a valuation allowance is established. Tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve. Frequent changes in tax laws in each jurisdiction complicate
future estimates. To determine the tax rate, we are required to estimate full-year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction. We update the estimated effective tax rate for the effect of significant unusual items as they are
identified. Changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre-tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate, and such changes could be material.

Regarding accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, we
recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. We measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are
recognized, assess the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and classify and disclose the liabilities within the consolidated financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits based on the guidance in the
interpretation of ASC 740,

Accounting for Income Taxes

. The interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our Consolidated Statement of Income and
presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We classify interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense.

•

Share-Based Compensation – The Company grants various share-based compensation awards, including stock options, performance unit shares,
restricted stock and restricted stock units. Under fair value recognition provisions, share-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period.
Determining the fair value of share-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating Cooper’s stock price volatility, employee exercise behaviors and related employee forfeiture rates.

The expected life of the share-based awards is based on the
observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. In determining the expected volatility, management considers
implied volatility from publicly-traded options on the Company’s stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the U.S. Treasury with a term equal
to the expected life of the award. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant.

As share-based compensation expense recognized in our
Consolidated Statements of Income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, based on historical experience, and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.

If factors change and the Company employs
different assumptions in the application of the fair value recognition provisions, the compensation expense that it records in future periods may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period.

New Accounting Pronouncements

On November 1, 2010, the Company adopted portions of the Accounting
Standards Update (ASU) 2010-6,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures: Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements,

which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820,

Fair Value Measurements

. This ASU added new
requirements for disclosures about (1) the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value, (2) the valuation techniques and inputs used, (3) the activity in Level 3 fair value measurements and (4) the
transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 fair value measurements. The requirement to provide the Level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements on a gross basis will be effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on
November 1, 2011. As this guidance only requires enhanced disclosures, as applicable, its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU
2010-29,

Business Combinations: Disclosure of Supplementary Proforma Information for Business Combinations,

which amends ASC 805,

Business Combinations

. The amendments in this ASU affect any public entity as defined by ASC 805 that
enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis. The amendments in this ASU specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the
combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. The amendments also expand the supplemental proforma disclosures to
include a description of the nature and amount of material, nonrecurring proforma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported proforma revenue and earnings. The amendments are effective prospectively for
business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU
2010-29, which is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2011, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2010, the FASB issued ASU No. 2010-28,

Intangibles –
Goodwill and Other: When to Perform Step 2 of the Goodwill Impairment Test for Reporting Units with Zero or Negative Carrying

Amounts

, which amends ASC 350,

Intangibles – Goodwill and Other

. The amendments in this ASU modify
Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts. For those reporting units, an entity is required to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill
impairment exists. In determining whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist. The qualitative factors are
consistent with the existing guidance and examples, which require that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2010-28, which is effective for the Company on November 1,
2011, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is not permitted.

In May 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-04,

Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs,

which amends ASC 820

, Fair Value Measurement.

This ASU represents the converged guidance of the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (the Boards) on fair value measurement. The amendments (1) clarify the Boards’ intent regarding the application of existing fair
value measurement guidance, (2) revise certain measurement guidance that changes or modifies a principle and (3) add disclosure requirements concerning the measurement uncertainty of level 3 measurements. The Boards concluded that the
common requirements will result in greater comparability of fair value measurements presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards. The amendments are effective
during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011 and are to be applied prospectively. Early application is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of ASU 2011-04, which is effective for the
Company on November 1, 2012, on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-05,

Presentation of Comprehensive Income.

This ASU, which amends ASC 220,

Comprehensive Income

, allows an entity the option to present the total of
comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In both options, an entity is required
to present each component of net income along with total net income, each component of other comprehensive income along with a total for other comprehensive income and a total amount for comprehensive income. ASU 2011-05 eliminates the option to
present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders’ equity. The amendments do not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income or when an item of other comprehensive
income must be reclassified to net income. The amendments made by ASU 2011-05 should be applied retrospectively and become effective for fiscal years (and interim periods within those years) beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of ASU 2011-05, which is effective for the Company for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2012, will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In September 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-08,

Intangibles-Goodwill and
Other: Testing Goodwill for Impairment

. ASU 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is “more likely than not” that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a
basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test as described in ASC 350,

Intangibles-Goodwill and Other

. The ASU defines the more-likely-than-not threshold as having a likelihood of more than
50%. Under the amendments in this update, an entity is not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. ASU 2011-08 is
effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU, which is effective for the Company
for the fiscal year beginning on November 1, 2012, will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

Consolidation

The financial statements in this report include the accounts of all of
Cooper’s consolidated entities. All significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation.

Foreign Currency Translation

Most of our operations outside the United States use their local currency as their functional currency. We translate these assets and liabilities into
U.S. dollars at year-end exchange rates. We translate income and expense accounts at weighted average rates for each year. We record gains and losses from the translation of financial statements in foreign currencies into U.S. dollars in other
comprehensive income. We record gains and losses from changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than each reporting location’s functional currency in net income for each period. We recorded in other income net
foreign exchange losses of $1.0 million for fiscal 2011 and $1.2 million for fiscal 2010, and a net foreign exchange gain of $7.0 million for fiscal 2009.

Financial Instruments

We may use derivatives to reduce market risks associated with changes in foreign exchange and interest rates. We do not use derivatives for trading or
speculative purposes. We believe that the counterparties with which we enter into forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements are financially sound and that the credit risk of these contracts is not significant.

Litigation

We are subject to various claims and contingencies relating to litigation arising out of the normal course of business. If we
believe the likelihood of an adverse legal outcome is probable and the amount is estimable, we accrue a liability in accordance with accounting guidance for contingencies. We consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and seek input
both within and outside the Company with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business.

Long-lived Assets

The Company reviews long-lived assets held and used, intangible assets with finite useful lives and assets held for sale for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If an evaluation of recoverability is required, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset’s carrying amount to determine if a write-down
is required. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. If management has committed to a plan to dispose of long-lived assets, the
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell.

The Company provides optometric practices with in-office lenses used in marketing programs to facilitate efficient and convenient fitting of contact lenses by practitioners. Such lens fitting sets
generally consist of a physical binder or rack to store contact lenses and an array of lenses. We record the costs associated with the original fitting set to other long-term assets on our Consolidated Balance



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

Sheet. We amortize such costs over their estimated useful lives to selling, general and administrative expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income. We also expense the cost for lenses
provided to practitioners as replenishment for fitting sets in the period shipped to selling, general and administrative expense on our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

Cash and cash equivalents include short-term income producing investments
with maturity dates of three months or less. These investments are readily convertible to cash and are carried at cost, which approximates market value.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost
or market. Cost is computed using standard cost that approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at
cost. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method in amounts sufficient to write off depreciable assets over their estimated useful lives. We amortize leasehold improvements over their estimated useful lives or the period of the related
lease, whichever is shorter. We depreciate buildings over 35 to 40 years and machinery and equipment over 3 to 15 years.

We expense costs for maintenance and repairs and capitalize major replacements, renewals and betterments. We eliminate the cost and accumulated
depreciation of depreciable assets retired or otherwise disposed of from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts and reflect any gains or losses in operations for the period. We had no impairments of property, plant and equipment for the



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

years ended October 31, 2011 and 2010. We had capitalized interest included in construction in progress of $8.7 million and $14.6 million for the years ended October 31, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

Earnings Per Share

We determine basic earnings per share (EPS) by using the weighted average
number of shares outstanding. We determine diluted EPS by increasing the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the denominator by the number of outstanding dilutive equity awards using the treasury stock method. In fiscal 2008, related to
our convertible debentures, we used the if-converted method to include in the denominator the number of shares of common stock contingently issuable pursuant to the convertible debentures, and we adjust the numerator to add back the after-tax amount
of interest recognized in the period associated with the convertible debentures. The numerator and denominator are only adjusted when the impact is dilutive.

Treasury Stock

The Company records treasury stock purchases under the cost method whereby the entire cost of the acquired stock is recorded as treasury stock. At
October 31, 2011 and 2010, the number of shares in treasury was 168,885 and 313,285, respectively. No shares were purchased during the years ended October 31, 2011 and 2010.

Note 2. Restructuring Costs

Restructuring Costs

2009 CooperVision Manufacturing Restructuring Plan

In the fiscal third quarter of 2009, CooperVision initiated a restructuring
plan to relocate contact lens manufacturing from Norfolk, Virginia, and transfer part of its contact lens manufacturing from Adelaide, Australia, to existing manufacturing operations in Juana Diaz, Puerto Rico, and Hamble, UK (2009 CooperVision
Manufacturing restructuring plan). This plan is intended to better utilize CooperVision’s manufacturing efficiencies and reduce its manufacturing expenses through a reduction in workforce of approximately 480 employees.

CooperVision completed restructuring activities in Adelaide in our fiscal
third quarter of 2010 and in Norfolk in our fiscal first quarter of 2011.

The total restructuring costs under this plan were approximately $23.1 million, with $15.4 million associated with assets, including accelerated depreciation and facility lease and contract termination
costs, and $7.7 million associated with employee benefit costs, including severance payments, termination benefit costs, retention bonus payouts and other similar costs. These costs were reported as cost of sales or restructuring costs in our
Consolidated Statements of Income.

In fiscal 2011,
$1.9 million, including $0.8 million of employee benefit costs and $1.1 million of costs associated with assets, primarily non-cash, were reported in cost of sales. In fiscal 2010, $16.1 million, including $3.3 million of employee
benefit costs and $12.8 million of costs associated with assets,



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

primarily non-cash, were reported as $16.0 million in cost of sales and $0.1 million in restructuring costs. In fiscal 2009, $5.1 million including $3.6 million of employee benefit costs and $1.5
million of non-cash costs associated with assets were reported as $5.0 million in cost of sales and $0.1 million in restructuring costs.

The Company may, from time to time, decide to
pursue additional restructuring activities that involve charges in future periods.

Note 3. Intangible Assets



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

Of the October 31, 2011 goodwill balance, $79.7 million is expected to be deductible for tax
purposes.

We estimate that amortization expense will
average $20.6 million per year in the three-year period ending October 31, 2014, and average $11.6 million in the two succeeding years ending October 31, 2016.

Note 4. Debt



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

Annual maturities of long-term debt as of October 31, 2011, are as follows:

Credit Agreement

On January 12, 2011, Cooper refinanced its existing syndicated Senior
Unsecured Revolving Line of Credit (Revolver) with a new Credit Agreement that provides for a multicurrency revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $750.0 million and an amortizing term loan facility in an original principal
amount of $250.0 million, each of which, unless terminated earlier, mature on January 12, 2016. In addition, the Company has the ability from time to time to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by up to an additional $250.0
million. KeyBank led the refinancing with certain banks that participated in the Revolver retaining or increasing their participation in the Credit Agreement.

Amounts outstanding under the new Credit Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either the base rate, which is a rate per annum equal
to the greatest of (a) KeyBank’s prime rate, (b) one-half of one percent in excess of the federal funds effective rate and (c) one percent in excess of the adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period on such day, or the
LIBOR or adjusted foreign currency rate, plus, in each case, an applicable margin in respect of base rate loans and in respect of LIBOR or adjusted foreign currency rate loans. The applicable margins are determined quarterly based upon the
Company’s ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated proforma EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement. At October 31, 2011, the weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balances was 1.6%.

The Company pays an annual commitment fee that ranges from 0.15% to 0.50% of
the unused portion of the revolving credit facility depending on our ratio of consolidated funded indebtedness to consolidated proforma EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Agreement. In addition to this annual commitment fee, the Company is also
required to pay certain letter of credit and related fronting fees and other administrative fees pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement.

The Company’s new credit facility is not secured by any of its, or any of its subsidiaries’, assets. All obligations under the new credit
facility will be guaranteed by each of the Company’s existing and future direct and indirect material domestic subsidiaries.

The term loan facility will amortize in equal quarterly installments as follows, with the remainder due on the term loan maturity date: 5% of the
aggregate principal amount of the term loan for the first three years following the closing date and 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the term loan for the fourth and fifth years following the closing date.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company is also required to maintain specified
financial ratios:

•

The ratio of Consolidated Proforma EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense (as defined, Interest Coverage Ratio) be at least 3.00 to 1.00 at all times.

•

The ratio of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness to Consolidated Proforma EBITDA (as defined, Total Leverage Ratio) be no higher than 3.75 to 1.00.

At October 31, 2011, the Company’s
Interest Coverage Ratio was 21.42 to 1.00 and the Total Leverage Ratio was 1.03 to 1.00.

The Company wrote off about $0.3 million of debt issuance costs in interest expense as a result of extinguishing the Revolver. The remaining $0.5 million of existing debt issuance costs and the
$9.5 million of costs incurred to refinance the Credit Agreement are carried in other assets and amortized to interest expense over the life of the Credit Agreement.

At October 31, 2011, we had $650.7
million available under the Credit Agreement.

Senior Notes

On January 31, 2007, the Company issued $350.0 million
aggregate principal amount of 7.125% Senior Notes (the Notes) due February 15, 2015, of which none were outstanding at the end of fiscal 2011. The Notes paid interest semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning
August 15, 2007. The Notes were offered in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933.

On January 12, 2011, we provided formal notice, and on February 15, 2011, we redeemed all $339.0 million aggregate principal amount
outstanding of the Notes in accordance with the terms of the Indenture among the Company, the guarantors party thereto and HSBC Bank USA, National Association, as trustee, pursuant to which the Notes were issued. In accordance with the Indenture,
the redemption price for the Notes was 103.563% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to February 15, 2011, the redemption date. Due to the redemption of all outstanding Notes, we no longer disclose financial information
for guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries.

In our fiscal
second quarter of 2011, we recorded a $16.5 million loss on the repurchase that includes the write-off of about $4.4 million of unamortized costs and the redemption premium of $12.1 million related to the Notes on our Consolidated Statement of
Income. The Company paid the aggregate purchase price from borrowings under the new Credit Agreement, including $250.0 million from the term loan facility.

European Credit Facility

The Company maintains a European credit facility with Citibank in the form of a continuing and unconditional guaranty. The aggregate facility limit was
$35.9 million and $33.0 million at October 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company will pay to Citibank all forms of indebtedness in the currency in which it is denominated for those certain subsidiaries. Interest expense is calculated on
all

debit balances based on an applicable base rate for each country plus a fixed spread common across most subsidiaries covered under the guaranty. At October 31, 2011, $15.7 million of the
facility was utilized. The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balances was 2.9%.

In addition to this European credit facility, the Company has available a non-guaranteed Euro-denominated Italian overdraft facility. The Facility limit was $0.8 million and $3.6 million at
October 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. At October 31, 2011, about $50 thousand of this facility was utilized.

Asian Pacific Credit Facilities

The Company maintained Yen-denominated and dollar-dominated credit facilities in Japan supported by continuing and unconditional guarantees. The aggregate
facility limit was $40.6 million and $27.4 million at October 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company will pay all forms of indebtedness in Yen upon demand. Interest expense is calculated on the outstanding balance based on the base
rate, TIBOR or Euroyen plus a fixed spread. At October 31, 2011, $23.4 million of the combined facilities was utilized. The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balances was 0.8%.

The Company maintains credit facilities for certain of our Asia Pacific
subsidiaries with JP Morgan. Each facility is supported by a continuing and unconditional guaranty. The aggregate facility limit was $7.6 million and $5.0 million at October 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company will pay all forms
of indebtedness, for each facility, in the currency in which it is denominated for those certain subsidiaries. Interest expense is calculated on all outstanding balances based on an applicable base rate for each country plus a fixed spread common
across all subsidiaries covered under each guaranty. At October 31, 2011, $0.7 million of the facility was utilized. The weighted average interest rate on the outstanding balances was 6.0%.

Letters of Credit

The Company maintains letters of credit throughout the world with various
financial institutions that primarily serve as guarantee notes on debt obligations. The aggregate outstanding amount of letters of credit at October 31, 2011 was $2.8 million.

Note 5. Income Taxes

Cooper’s effective tax rate (ETR) (provision for
income taxes divided by pretax income) for the fiscal year 2011 was 9%. Our results include the fiscal year ETR, plus any discrete items. The ETR used to record the provision for income taxes for the fiscal year 2010 was 9.3%. The ETR is less than
the United States statutory rate as a majority of our income is earned in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates reflecting the shift in the geographic mix of income during recent periods with income earned in foreign jurisdictions increasing as
compared to income earned in the United States. As a result, the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income primarily within CooperVision has decreased over recent fiscal periods. A reduction in the ratio of domestic income to worldwide income
effectively lowers the overall tax rate due to the fact that the tax rates in the majority of foreign jurisdictions where



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

the Company operates are significantly lower than the statutory rate in the United States. The completion of the Company’s restructuring plan to close a CooperVision manufacturing facility,
located in Norfolk, Virginia, with the manufacturing demand subsequently absorbed by our plants in the United Kingdom and Puerto Rico contributed to this change in the geographic mix of income. As a result of this restructuring, substantially all of
CooperVision’s contact lens products are manufactured outside of the United States.

Additionally, in fiscal 2011, the Company recorded a $16.5 million domestic loss on the repurchase of its Senior Notes that included the write off of about $4.4 million of unamortized costs and the
redemption premium of $12.1 million. This impacted the Company’s tax provision and further reduced the overall effective tax rate.

The components of income from continuing operations before income taxes and the income tax provision related to income from all operations in our
Consolidated Statements of Income consist of:

The income tax provision related to income
from continuing operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income consists of:

We reconcile the provision for income taxes attributable to income from operations and the amount
computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% to income before income taxes as follows:

The tax effects of temporary differences that
give rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities are:



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

Current deferred tax liabilities of $0.3 million at October 31, 2011, and $0.2 million at
October 31, 2010, are included in other accrued liabilities on the balance sheet.

In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities,
projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible,
management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the existing valuation allowances at October 31, 2011. The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable,
however, could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced.

The Company has not provided for federal income tax on approximately $880.2 million of undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries since the
Company intends to reinvest this amount outside the U.S. indefinitely.

At October 31, 2011, the Company had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $15.8 million and state net operating loss carryforwards of $34.6 million. The Company also had federal net operating
loss carryforwards of $30.6 million related to share option exercises as of October 31, 2011. A tax benefit and a credit to additional paid-in capital for the excess deduction would not be recognized until such deduction reduces taxes payable.
Additionally, the Company had $5.7 million of federal alternative minimum tax credits, $1.7 million of federal research credits and $0.2 million of California research credits. The federal net operating loss and federal research credits
carryforwards expire on various dates between 2025 through 2031, and the federal alternative minimum tax credits carry forward indefinitely. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire on various dates between 2019 through 2021 and the
California research credits carry forward indefinitely. The net operating loss and other tax credits may be subject to certain limitations upon utilization under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code.

The Company adopted the provisions of the interpretation of ASC 740-10-25-5
through 25-17,

Basic Recognition Threshold

, formerly FIN 48, on November 1, 2007. As a result of the adoption, the Company reduced its net liability for unrecognized tax benefits (UTB), previously classified in current taxes payable, by
$5.3 million, which was accounted for as an increase to retained earnings. The interpretation also provides guidance on how the interest and penalties related to tax positions may be recorded and classified within our Consolidated Statements of
Income and presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We classify interest expense and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as additional income tax expense.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

The aggregated changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows:

As of October 31, 2011, the Company had
$27.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including $1.6 million of related accrued interest and penalties that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. It is the Company’s policy to recognize interest and penalties directly
related to incomes taxes as additional income tax expense.

Included in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2011 is $9.0 million related to tax positions for which it is reasonably possible
that the total amounts could significantly change during the next twelve months. This amount represents a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits related to expiring statutes in various jurisdictions worldwide and comprises of transfer pricing and
other items.

The Company is required to file income tax returns
in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and many foreign jurisdictions.

On April 1, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued a Notice of Deficiency to the Company in connection with its audit of the Company’s income tax returns for the years 2005 and 2006.
The Notice asserts that the Company is subject to additional taxes due to a proposed adjustment under the anti-deferral provisions of Subpart F of the Internal Revenue Code. If sustained, such taxes should be offset by the Company’s existing
federal net operating loss carryforwards leaving a $1.2 million balance of proposed taxes owed. The Company intends to defend its positions taken in its income tax returns vigorously. However, if the IRS’s contentions were sustained, the
Company’s existing federal net operating loss carryforwards could be materially reduced, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company’s future net income.

As of October 31, 2011, the tax years for which the Company remains subject to United States Federal income tax assessment
upon examination are 2005 through 2010. The Company remains subject to income tax examinations in other major tax jurisdictions including the United Kingdom, France and Australia for the tax years 2006 through 2010.

Cash Dividends

In fiscal 2011 and 2010, we paid semiannual dividends of 3 cents per share:
an aggregate of approximately $1.4 million or 3 cents per share on February 7, 2011, to stockholders of record on January 19, 2011; $1.4 million or 3 cents per share on August 5, 2011, to stockholders of record on July 25, 2011;
$1.4 million on August 5, 2010, to stockholders of record on July 20, 2010; and $1.3 million on February 5, 2010, to stockholders of record on January 19, 2010.

Stockholders’ Rights Plan

Under our stockholders’ rights plan, each outstanding share of our common stock carries one-half of one preferred share purchase right (Right). The
Rights will become exercisable only under certain circumstances involving acquisition of beneficial ownership of 20% or more of our common stock by a person or group (Acquiring Person) without the prior consent of Cooper’s Board of Directors.
If a person or group becomes an Acquiring Person, each Right would then entitle the holder (other than an Acquiring Person) to purchase, for the then purchase price of the Right (currently $450, subject to adjustment), shares of Cooper’s common
stock, or shares of common stock of any person into which we are thereafter merged or to which 50% or more of our assets or earning power is sold, with a market value of twice the purchase price. The Rights will expire in October 2017 unless earlier
exercised or redeemed. The Board of Directors may redeem the Rights for $.01 per Right prior to any person or group becoming an Acquiring Person.

Note 8. Stock Plans

At October 31, 2011, Cooper had the following
stock-based compensation plans:

2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan
for Non-Employee Directors (2006 Directors Plan)

In March
2006, the Company received stockholder approval of the 2006 Directors Plan, and in March 2007, October 2007, October 2008 and December 2008, the Board of Directors amended the 2006 Directors Plan. The Company received stockholder approval
of an amendment and restatement of the 2006 Directors Plan in March 2009 and the Board of Directors amended the Amended and Restated 2006 Directors Plan in October 2009 and October 2010. The Company received stockholder approval of a further
amendment and restatement of the 2006 Directors Plan in March 2011 and the Board of Directors amended the Second Amended and Restated 2006 Directors Plan in October 2011.

The Second Amended and Restated 2006 Directors Plan, as amended, authorizes
either Cooper’s Board of Directors or a designated committee thereof composed of two or more Non-Employee Directors to grant to Non-Employee Directors during the period ending March 21, 2019, equity awards for up to 950,000 shares of
common stock, subject to adjustment for future stock splits, stock dividends, expirations, forfeitures and similar events.

As amended, the Second Amended and Restated 2006 Directors Plan provides for annual grants of stock options and restricted stock to Non-Employee Directors
on November 1 and November 15, respectively, of each fiscal year. Specifically, each Non-Employee Director may be awarded the right to purchase 2,000 restricted shares (2,200 shares in the case of the Chairman of the Board) of the
Company’s common stock for $0.10 per share on each November 15. The restrictions on the restricted stock will lapse on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Each Non-Employee Director may also be awarded 6,500 options (7,150 options
in the case of the Lead Director and/or the Chairman of the Board) to purchase common stock on each November 1. These options vest on the first anniversary of the date of grant. Options expire no more than 10 years after the grant date. In
December 2008, the 2006 Directors’ Plan was also amended to allow discretionary granting of stock options and/or restricted stock with similar terms to the annual grant other than the specific share requirements. As of October 31, 2011,
355,566 shares remained available under the 2006 Directors’ Plan for future grants.

2007 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2007 LTIP)

In March 2007, the Company received stockholder approval of the 2007 LTIP and in October 2007, the Board of Directors amended the 2007 LTIP. In March 2009, the Company received stockholder approval of an
amendment and restatement of the 2007 LTIP and in March 2011, the Company received stockholder approval of a further amendment and restatement of the 2007 LTIP.

The Second Amended and Restated 2007 LTIP is designed to increase Cooper’s stockholder value by attracting, retaining and motivating key employees
and consultants who directly influence our profitability. The Second Amended and Restated 2007 LTIP authorizes either Cooper’s Board of Directors, or a designated committee thereof composed of two or more Non-Employee Directors, to grant to
eligible individuals during the period ending December 31, 2017, specified equity awards including stock option, restricted stock units and performance share awards subject to adjustment for future stock splits, stock dividends, expirations,
forfeitures and similar events.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

During fiscal 2011, the Company granted stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance
share awards to employees under the Amended and Restated 2007 LTIP. Equity awards are granted at 100% of fair market value on the date of grant and expire no more than 10 years after the grant date. Stock options may become exercisable based on our
common stock achieving certain price targets, specified time periods elapsing or other criteria designated by the Board or its authorized committee at their discretion. RSUs are nontransferable awards entitling the recipient to receive shares of
common stock, without any payment in cash or property, in one or more installments at a future date or dates as determined by the Board of Directors or its authorized committee. For RSUs, legal ownership of the shares is not transferred to the
employee until the unit vests, which is generally over a four-year period. Performance share awards are nontransferable awards entitling the recipient to receive a variable number of shares of common stock, without any payment in cash or property,
in one or more installments at a future date or dates as determined by the Board of Directors or its authorized committee. Legal ownership of the shares is not transferred to the recipient until the award vests, and the number of shares distributed
is dependent upon the achievement of certain performance targets over a specified period of time. As of October 31, 2011, 2,298,692 shares remained available under the Amended and Restated 2007 LTIP for future grants. The amount of available
shares includes shares which may be distributed under performance share awards.

Share-Based Compensation

The compensation cost and related income tax benefit recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for share-based awards were as follows:

Cash received from exercises under all
share-based payment arrangements for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $82.0 million, $11.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively.

Details regarding the valuation and accounting for share-based awards follow.

Stock Options

The fair value of each stock option award granted is estimated on the date
of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation model and assumptions noted in the following table. The expected life of the awards is based on the observed and expected time to post-vesting forfeiture and/or exercise. Groups of employees that
have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. In determining the expected volatility, management considers implied volatility from



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

publicly-traded options on the Company’s stock at the date of grant, historical volatility and other factors. The risk-free interest rate is based on the continuous rates provided by the
U.S. Treasury with a term equal to the expected life of the option. The dividend yield is based on the projected annual dividend payment per share, divided by the stock price at the date of grant.

The status of the Company’s stock option
plans at October 31, 2011, is summarized below:

The weighted-average fair value of each
option granted during fiscal 2011, estimated as of the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, for the 2007 LTIP was $21.15. The weighted-average fair value of each option granted during fiscal 2010, estimated as of the grant date
using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, for the 2007 LTIP was $14.44. For the 2006 Directors Plan, the weighted-average fair value of options granted for fiscal 2011 and 2010 were $18.96 and $11.32, respectively. The expected requisite service
period for options granted to employees in fiscal 2011 was generally 48 months. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended October 31, 2011 was $53.1 million. The periodic adjustments of the forfeiture rate resulted in
reductions in share-based compensation expense of $1.9 million in fiscal 2011 and $1.2 million in fiscal 2010. Directors’ options and restricted stock grants are expensed on the date of grant as the 2006 Directors Plan does not contain a
substantive future requisite service period.

Stock awards
outstanding under the Company’s current plans have been granted at prices which are either equal to or above the market value of the common stock on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2007 LTIP generally vest over three and one-half
to five years based on market and service conditions and expire no later than either five or ten years after the grant date. Options granted under the 2006 Directors Plan generally vest in one year or upon achievement of a market condition and
expire no later than ten years after the grant date. The Company generally recognizes compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. As of October 31, 2011, there was $7.2 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to
nonvested options, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.7 years.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

Restricted Stock Units

RSUs granted under the 2007 LTIP have been granted at prices which are
either equal to or above the market value of the stock on the date of grant and generally vest over four years. The fair value of restricted stock units is estimated on the date of grant based on the market price of our common stock. The Company
recognizes compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. As of October 31, 2011, there was $19.0 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining
weighted-average vesting period of 2.9 years.

The status of the
Company’s non-vested RSUs at October 31, 2011, is summarized below:

Performance Units

Performance units are granted to selected executives and other key employees
with vesting contingent upon meeting future reported earnings per share goals over a defined performance cycle, usually three years. Performance units, if earned, may be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The performance shares actually earned
will range from zero to 150% of the target number of performance shares for performance periods ending in fiscal 2011 through fiscal 2013. Subject to limited exceptions set forth in the performance share plan, any shares earned will be distributed
in the immediate subsequent fiscal period after the performance period. The fair value of performance unit awards is estimated on the date of grant based on the current market price of our common stock and the estimate of probability of award
achievement. This estimate is reviewed each fiscal period and adjustments are recorded prospectively if it is determined that the estimate of probability of award achievement has changed.

The Company recognizes compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. As of October 31, 2011, there was $6.2
million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested performance units, which is expected to be recognized over a remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.8 years.

Performance units granted on February 10, 2009 vested on October 31, 2011 and met 150% of the target. Subject to the
provisions of the plan, the Company expects to award 80,850 shares of common stock in the fiscal first quarter of 2012. The Company also granted performance unit awards on December 12, 2009 and December 13, 2010 with specific performance
goals for each period ending on October 31, 2012 and October 31, 2013, respectively.

Note 9. Employee Benefits

Cooper’s Retirement Income Plan

Cooper’s Retirement Income Plan (Plan), a defined benefit plan, covers
substantially all full-time United States employees. Cooper’s contributions are designed to fund normal cost on a current basis and to fund over 30 years the estimated prior service cost of benefit improvements (5 years for annual gains and
losses). The unit credit actuarial cost method is used to determine the annual cost. Cooper pays the entire cost of the Plan and funds such costs as they accrue. Virtually all of the assets of the Plan are comprised of equities and participation in
equity and fixed income funds.

The following table sets forth the
Plan’s benefit obligations and fair value of the Plan assets at October 31, 2011, and the funded status of the Plan and net periodic pension costs for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2011.

Retirement Income Plan

Other changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income

The estimated net loss, net transition
obligation and prior service cost for the plan that will be amortized from accumulated other comprehensive income into net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year are $1,125,888, $20,788 and $24,208, respectively.

The discount rate enables us to state
expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date. The discount rate used for the plan is based primarily on the yields of a universe of high quality corporate bonds or the spot rate of high quality AA-rated corporate bonds, with
durations corresponding to the expected durations of the benefit obligations. A change in the discount rate will cause the present value of benefit obligations to change in the opposite direction. If a discount rate of 5.50%, which is similar to
prior fiscal year, had been used, the projected benefit obligation would have been $57.7 million, and the accumulated benefit obligation would have been $51.4 million.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined based on a review of historical returns, both
for this plan and for medium- to large-sized defined benefit pension funds with similar asset allocations. This review generated separate expected returns for each asset class listed below. These expected future returns were then blended based on
this Plan’s target asset allocation.

Plan Assets

Weighted-average asset allocations at year end, by asset
category are as follows:

The Plan invests in a diversified portfolio
of assets intended to minimize risk of poor returns while maximizing expected portfolio returns. To achieve the long-term rate of return, plan assets will be invested in a mixture of instruments, including but not limited to, corporate common stock
(may include the Company’s stock), investment grade bond funds, cash, balanced funds, real estate funds, small or large cap equity funds and international equity funds. The allocation of assets will be determined by the investment manager, and
will typically include 50% to 80% equities with the remainder invested in fixed income and cash. Presently, this diversified portfolio is expected to return roughly 8.5% in the long run.

Fair Value Measurement of Plan Assets

The Plan has an established process for
determining the fair value of plan assets. Fair value is based upon quoted market prices, as Level 1 inputs, where available. For our investments in equity and bond



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

mutual funds, and real estate funds, fair value is based on observable, Level 1 inputs, as price quotes are available and the fair values of these funds were not impacted by liquidity
restrictions or the fund status. Level 2 assets are those where price quotes are not readily available and the fair value would be determined based on other observable inputs. Level 3 assets are those where price quotes are not readily available and
the fair value would be determined based on unobservable inputs.

While the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or
assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

Cash Flows

Contributions

The Company contributions to the pension plan were $5.6 million, $3.8 million and $4.7 million for fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The Company
closely monitors the funded status of the Plan with respect to legislative and accounting rules. The Company is expected to make contributions of about $5.2 million during fiscal 2012.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

In October 2007, we adopted the funded status
provision of ASC 715,

Compensation – Retirement Benefits

, which required that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the Plan as an asset or liability on our October 31, 2007 Consolidated Balance Sheet. Subsequent
changes in the funded status are recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. ASC 715 also requires that for fiscal 2009 and future years, our assumptions used to measure annual pension expenses be determined as of the
balance sheet date and all plan assets and liabilities be reported as of that date. For fiscal years ending October 31, 2008 and prior, the Plan used an August 31 measurement date, and all plan assets and obligations were generally
reported as of that date.

Cooper’s 401(k) Savings Plan

Cooper’s 401(k) savings plan provides for the deferral
of compensation as described in the Internal Revenue Code and is available to substantially all full-time United States employees. Employees who participate in the 401(k) plan may elect to have from 1% to 75% of their pre-tax salary or wages
deferred and contributed to the trust established under the plan. Cooper’s contributions on account of participating employees, net of forfeiture credits, were $2.4 million, $2.1 million and $2.2 million for the years ended October 31,
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Note 10. Financial Instruments

We operate multiple foreign subsidiaries that manufacture
and/or sell our products worldwide. As a result, our earnings, cash flow and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, sales transactions, capital expenditures and net
investment in certain foreign operations. Our policy is to minimize, to the extent reasonable and practical, transaction, remeasurement and specified economic exposures with derivatives instruments such as foreign exchange forward contracts and
cross currency swaps. The gains and losses on these derivatives are intended to at least partially offset the transaction gains and losses recognized in earnings. We do not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes. Under ASC 815,

Derivatives and Hedging

, all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. As discussed below, the accounting for gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value depends on the use of the derivative and whether it is
designated and qualifies for hedge accounting.

Through the normal
course of its business activities, the Company recognizes that it is exposed to foreign exchange risks. Our primary objective is to protect the United States dollar value of future cash flows and minimize the volatility of reported earnings while
strictly adhering to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. To meet this objective, business exposures to foreign exchange risks must be identified, measured and minimized using the most effective and efficient methods to
eliminate, reduce or transfer such exposures.

Exposures are
reduced whenever possible by taking advantage of offsetting payable and receivable balances and netting net sales against expenses, also referred to as natural hedges. We may employ the use of foreign currency derivative instruments to manage a
portion of the remaining foreign exchange risk. While we designate our exposures under derivative accounting on a gross basis, foreign currency derivatives may be used to protect against an exposure value resulting from forecasted non-functional
currency denominated net sales and expenses. Our risk management objectives and the strategies for achieving those objectives depend on the type of exposure being hedged.

The Company is also exposed to risks associated with changes in interest
rates, as the interest rate on our Credit Agreement varies. To mitigate this risk, we may hedge portions of our variable rate debt by swapping those portions to fixed rates.

We only enter into derivative financial instruments with institutions with
which we have an International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) agreement in place. Our derivative financial instruments do not contain credit risk related contingent features such as call features or requirements for posting collateral. Although the
Company and its counterparties have some right of set-off, all foreign exchange derivatives are displayed gross in the fair value tabular disclosure and accounted for as such in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We adjust our foreign exchange forward
contracts and cross currency swaps for credit risk on a per derivative basis. However, when applicable, we record interest rate derivatives as net on our Consolidated Balance Sheet, in accordance with derivative accounting, but gross in the fair
value tabular disclosure. When we net or set-off our interest rate derivative obligations, only the net asset or liability position will be credit affected. For the years ending October 31, 2011 and 2010, all of our interest rate derivatives
were in a liability position and, therefore, were not set-off in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Since ISDA agreements are signed between the Company and each respective financial institution, netting is permitted on a per institution

basis only. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counterparty credit ratings. We consider our credit non-performance risk to be minimal because we award and disperse derivatives business
between multiple commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.

Cash Flow Hedging

The Company is exposed to the effects of foreign exchange movements. From time to time, we may choose to manage enterprise risk by locking in all or a portion of the anticipated cash flows that are linked
to accounting exposures such as nonfunctional currency intercompany payables/receivables, through derivative instruments. To execute this strategy, we may hedge the specific identified foreign exchange risk exposure, thereby locking in the rate at
which these forecasted transactions will be recorded and ultimately reduce earnings volatility related to the enterprise risk.

Cash flow hedge accounting allows for the gains or losses on the change in fair value of the derivatives related to forecasted transactions to be recorded
in Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) (OCI) until the underlying forecasted transaction occurs. However, this accounting treatment is limited to hedging specific transactions that can be clearly defined and specifically create risk to functional
currency cash flow.

All sales and expenses with unrelated
third parties not denominated in USD subject the Company to economic risk. We typically designate and document qualifying foreign exchange forward contracts related to certain forecasted intercompany sales and purchases associated with third party
transactions, as cash flow hedges.

To manage foreign currency
exposure related to forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and purchases of product, the Company may enter into foreign currency forward contracts. Typical currencies traded are those which represent the largest risk for the Company,
including but not limited to the British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen. In fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company did not enter into such forward contracts.

The effective portion of cash flow hedge contracts’ gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of hedges is initially reported as a
component of accumulated OCI in stockholders’ equity until the underlying hedged item is reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income, at which time the effective amount in OCI is reclassified to either net sales or cost of sales in our
Consolidated Statements of Income. As of October 31, 2011, there were no cash flow hedges outstanding.

We calculate hedge effectiveness prospectively and retrospectively, excluding time value, on a monthly basis using regression as well as other timing and probability criteria required by derivative
accounting. We record any ineffectiveness and any excluded components of the hedge immediately to other income or expense in our Consolidated Statement of Income. In the event the underlying forecasted transaction does not occur within the
designated hedge period, or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur, the related gains and losses on the cash flow hedges are immediately reclassified from OCI to other income or expense in our Consolidated Statement of
Income. In fiscal 2011 and 2010, no ineffectiveness was recorded.

Rollforward of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Balance Sheet Hedges

We may manage the foreign currency risk associated with nonfunctional
currency assets and liabilities using foreign exchange forward contracts with maturities of less than 24 months and cross currency swaps with maturities up to 36 months. As of October 31, 2011 and 2010, all outstanding balance sheet hedging
derivatives had maturities of less than 12 months. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recognized in other income or expense.

Monthly adjustments to the cash flow hedging program explained above require nondesignated hedges to be placed when cash flow hedges are utilized faster
or earlier than planned. This occurs regularly, and hedge amounts tend to be less than $5.0 million dollars per affected relationship.

Other common exposures hedged are intercompany payables and receivables between entities. Such obligations are generally short-term in nature, often
outstanding for less than 90 days. These types of exposures are hedged monthly and are typically less than $10.0 million per hedge.

These derivative instruments do not subject the Company to material balance sheet risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these
derivatives are intended to offset gains and losses on the nonfunctional currency assets and liabilities being hedged.

Interest Rate Swaps

The Company may enter into floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps to fix the floating rate debt under our Credit Agreement. These interest rate swaps hedge
variable interest payments by exchanging variable rate interest risk for a fixed interest rate. On May 3, 2007, the Company entered into four floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps with notional values totaling $250.0
million, served to fix the floating rate debt for terms between 30 and 48 months with fixed rates between 4.94% to 4.96%. As of October 31, 2011, all of these interest rate swaps had expired.

On March 10, 2011, the Company entered into five floating-to-fixed
interest rate swaps. These interest rate swaps with notional values totaling $200.0 million, serve to fix the floating rate debt for terms between 26 and 38 months with fixed rates between 1.27% and 1.78%. We qualified and designated these swaps as
cash flow hedges and recorded the offset of the cumulative fair market value (net of tax effect) to accumulated OCI in our Consolidated Condensed Balance Sheet.



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

Effectiveness testing of the hedge relationship and measurement to quantify ineffectiveness is performed
at a minimum each fiscal quarter using the hypothetical derivative method. The outstanding swaps have been and are expected to remain highly effective for the life of the swap. Effective amounts are reclassified to interest expense as the related
hedged expense is incurred. The fair value of the outstanding swap is recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and presented in the table below. Excluded from this table are liabilities of $0.3 million and $1.3 million that were recorded and
attributable to accrued interest as of October 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We expect to reclassify $2.0 million from OCI to interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income over the next 12 months and $2.6 million
thereafter.

Fair Value Hedging

From time to time, we designate and document foreign exchange forward
contracts related to firm commitments for third party royalty payments as fair value hedges. In accordance with policy, these derivatives are employed to eliminate, reduce or transfer selected foreign currency risks that meet the accounting
definition of a firm commitment. Fair value hedges are evaluated for effectiveness at a minimum each fiscal quarter and any ineffectiveness is recorded in other income and expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The critical terms of the
forward contract and the firm commitments are matched at inception and subsequent prospective forward contract effectiveness is measured by comparing the cumulative change in the fair value of the forward contract to the cumulative change in value
of the specified firm commitment, including time value. The derivative fair values are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognized currently in earnings; this is offset by the effective gains and losses on the change in value of the
firm commitment which is recorded in accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In fiscal 2011 and 2010, the Company did not designate any derivatives as fair value hedges.

Note 11. Fair Value Measurements

As of October 31, 2011 and 2010, the carrying value
of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, lines of credit, accounts payable and other current liabilities approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of such instruments and the ability to
obtain financing on similar terms. The fair value of our long-term debt, consisting primarily of our credit agreement, approximated the carrying value at October 31, 2011 and 2010.

ASC 820,

Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures

(ASC 820), applies to all assets and liabilities that are being
measured and reported at fair value and defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 establishes a fair
value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. An asset’s or liability’s level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 requires that
assets and liabilities carried at fair value be valued and disclosed in one of the following three levels of the valuation hierarchy:

Level 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are
corroborated by market data.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs
reflecting the reporting entity’s own assumptions.

The
Company has derivative assets and liabilities that may include interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts. The impact of the counterparty’s creditworthiness when in an asset position and the Company’s
creditworthiness when in a liability position has also been factored into the fair value measurement of the derivative instruments. Both the counterparty and the Company are expected to continue to perform under the contractual terms of the
instruments.

We may use interest rate swaps to maintain our
desired mix of fixed-rate and variable-rate debt. The swaps exchange fixed and variable rate payments without exchanging the notional principal amount of the debt. The Company has elected to use the income approach to value the derivatives using



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
(Continued)

observable Level 2 market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount assuming that participants are motivated, but
not compelled to transact. Level 2 inputs are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, specifically euro dollar futures contracts up to three years, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
asset or liability – specifically LIBOR cash and swap rates and credit risk at commonly quoted intervals. Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient for fair value measurements.

We may use foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize, to the extent reasonable and practical, our exposure to the impact
of foreign currency fluctuations. The Company has elected to use the income approach to value the derivatives, using observable Level 2 market expectations at the measurement date and standard valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a
single present amount assuming that participants are motivated but not compelled to transact. Level 2 inputs for the valuations are limited to quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and inputs other than quoted prices that
are observable for the asset or liability – specifically LIBOR cash rates, credit risk at commonly quoted intervals, foreign exchange spot rates and forward points. Mid-market pricing is used as a practical expedient for fair value
measurements.

The following table sets forth the Company’s
financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 2 inputs during fiscal years 2011 and 2010, within the fair value hierarchy at October 31:

Legal Proceedings

On April 28, 2011, Rembrandt Vision Technologies, L.P. filed a lawsuit against CooperVision, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging that CooperVision
infringes U.S. Patent No. 5,712,327 entitled “Soft Gas Permeable Contact Lens Having Improved Clinical Performance,” which was issued on January 28, 1998, to Sing-Hsiung Chang and Mei-Zyh Chang. The complaint alleged that
CooperVision’s infringing conduct includes, but is not limited to, making, using, selling or offering to sell silicone hydrogel contact lenses. The complaint sought an unspecified amount of damages, including treble damages, attorneys’
fees and costs and an injunction preventing any alleged infringement. On October 27, 2011, Rembrandt dismissed its complaint in Texas and filed a complaint with the same allegations in the Middle District of Florida. On December 2, 2011,
CooperVision and Rembrandt entered into a settlement of the litigation. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, CooperVision agreed to make a single lump-sum payment of $10.0 million to Rembrandt, and Rembrandt granted a covenant not to sue under the
‘327 patent (and related domestic and foreign patents) to CooperVision and its suppliers, resellers, marketing partners and certain related individuals and entities. The parties also exchanged releases relating to the claims asserted in the
litigation. The case will be dismissed with prejudice as part of the settlement.

On November 28, 2011, Harold Greenberg filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Case No. C11-05697 PJH, against the following defendants: the
Company; Robert S. Weiss, its President, Chief Executive Officer and a director; Eugene J. Midlock, its Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Albert G. White, III, its Vice President of Investor Relations, Treasurer and Chief
Strategic Officer. Mr. Greenberg seeks to represent a class of persons who purchased the Company’s common stock between March 4, 2011 and November 15, 2011.

The lawsuit alleges that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 by, among other things, failing to disclose alleged problems at the Company’s manufacturing plants in Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, allegedly making material misstatements with an intent to deceive
investors concerning the recall of the Company’s Avaira Toric and Avaira Sphere contact lenses and the expected financial impact of the recalls, and allegedly making false projections of future financial results. The lawsuit seeks unspecified
damages.

The lawsuit has only recently been filed and there has
been no discovery or other proceedings in the case. Accordingly, the Company is not in a position to assess whether any loss or adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition is probable or remote or to estimate the range of potential
loss, if any.

In fiscal 2010, the Company settled a consolidated
securities class action lawsuit titled In re Cooper Companies, Inc. Securities Litigation in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Case No. SACV-06-169 CJC, against the Company, A. Thomas Bender, its Chairman of
the Board and a director, Robert S. Weiss, its Chief Executive Officer and a director, and Gregory A. Fryling, CooperVision’s former President and Chief Operating Officer. On May 4, 2010, the Company



THE COOPER COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

announced that it reached an agreement in principle and recorded a charge in our fiscal second quarter of 2010 to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit for $27.0 million, which we funded
into escrow in our fiscal fourth quarter of 2010. The Court granted final approval of the proposed settlement on December 13, 2010.

Note 13. Business Segment Information

Cooper is organized by business unit for management
reporting with operating income, as presented in our financial reports, the primary measure of segment profitability. We do not allocate costs from corporate functions to the segments’ operating income. Items below operating income are not
considered when measuring the profitability of a segment. We use the same accounting policies to generate segment results as we do for our consolidated results. Our two business segments – CooperVision and CooperSurgical – comprise
Cooper’s operations.

Total net sales include sales to
customers as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Income and sales between geographic areas that are priced at terms that allow for a reasonable profit for the seller. Operating income (loss) is total net sales less cost of sales, research and
development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, restructuring costs and amortization of intangible assets. Corporate operating loss is principally corporate headquarters expense. Loss on extinguishment of debt; other income
(expense), net and interest expense are not allocated to individual segments. Neither of our business segments relies on any one major customer.

Identifiable assets are those used in continuing operations except cash and cash equivalents, which we include as corporate assets. Long-lived assets are
property, plant and equipment.

The following table presents a
summary of our business segment net sales:

Note 14. Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

*

During the fiscal third quarter of 2011, we recorded an immaterial out-of-period adjustment related to CooperVision’s acquisition of certain assets of Asahikasei
Aime Co., Ltd. (Aime), to reduce the amount of recorded goodwill and reverse the $6.1 million gain on settlement of preexisting relationship reported in our fiscal first quarter of 2011. As discussed in Note 1, the Company determined that it
incorrectly applied the guidance in ASC 805,

Controls and Procedures.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

The Company has established and currently maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in its
reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission and that such information is accumulated and communicated to
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that controls and
procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives. In reaching a reasonable level of assurance, management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating
the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.

In conjunction with the close of each fiscal quarter, the Company conducts a review and evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of
the Company’s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer, based upon their evaluation as of October 31, 2011, the end of the fiscal period covered in this report, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable
assurance level.

Management’s Annual Report on Internal
Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal
control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements, errors or fraud.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2011, based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

. Based on this assessment, management, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2011.

The Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, has audited the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting as of October 31, 2011, as stated in their report in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

There has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended October 31,
2011, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
