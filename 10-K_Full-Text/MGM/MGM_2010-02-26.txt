PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

MGM MIRAGE is referred to as the “Company” or the
    “Registrant,” and together with our subsidiaries may
    also be referred to as “we,” “us” or
    “our.”

Overview

MGM MIRAGE is one of the world’s leading and most respected
    companies with significant holdings in gaming, hospitality and
    entertainment. We believe the resorts we own, manage, and invest
    in are among the world’s finest casino resorts. MGM MIRAGE
    is a Delaware corporation that acts largely as a holding
    company; our operations are conducted through our wholly-owned
    subsidiaries.

Our strategy is to generate sustainable, profitable growth by
    creating and maintaining competitive advantages and through the
    execution of our business plan, which is focused on:

•

Owning, developing, operating and strategically investing in a
    strong portfolio of resorts;

•

Operating our resorts in a manner that emphasizes the delivery
    of excellent customer service with the goal of maximizing
    revenue and profit; and

•

Leveraging our strong brands and taking advantage of significant
    management experience and expertise.

Resort
    Portfolio

We execute our strategy through a portfolio approach, seeking to
    ensure that we own, invest in and manage resorts that are
    superior to our competitors’ resorts in the markets in
    which our resorts are located and across our customer base. Our
    customer base is discussed below under “Resort
    Operation.”

We selectively acquire, invest in and develop resorts in markets
    with a stable regulatory history and environment. As seen in the
    table below, this means that a large portion of our resorts are
    located in Nevada. We target markets with growth potential and
    we believe there is growth potential in investing in and
    managing both gaming and non-gaming resorts. Our growth
    strategies are discussed in greater detail below under
    “Sustainable Growth and Leveraging Our Brand and Management
    Assets.”

Our
    Operating Resorts

We have provided below certain information about our resorts as
    of December 31, 2009. Except as otherwise indicated, we
    wholly own and operate the resorts shown below.

Portfolio
    Strategy

We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the
    markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the
    premier resorts in their respective markets requires targeted
    capital investments that promote our goal to create the greatest
    possible experiences for our guests. We have historically made
    significant investments in our resorts through the addition of
    new restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, and
    other new features and amenities. In addition, we have made
    regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our hotel
    rooms and public spaces. The quality of our resorts can be
    measured by our success in winning numerous awards, such as
    several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American
    Automobile Association and Four and Five Star designations from
    Mobil Travel.

We also actively manage our portfolio of land holdings. We own
    approximately 670 acres of land on the Las Vegas Strip,
    with a meaningful portion of those acres undeveloped acreage or
    acreage we consider to be under-developed.

Risks
    Associated with Our Portfolio Strategy

Certain principal risk factors relating to our current portfolio
    of resorts are:

•

Our limited geographic diversification — our major
    resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip and some of our
    largest competitors operate in more gaming markets than we do;

•

There are a number of gaming facilities located closer to where
    our customers live than our resorts; and

•

Additional new hotel-casinos and expansion projects at existing
    Las Vegas hotel-casinos are under construction or have been
    proposed. We are unable to determine to what extent increased
    competition will affect our future operating results.

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below for a more
    detailed discussion of these and other risk factors.



Resort
    Operation

Our operating philosophy is to create resorts of memorable
    character, treat our employees well and provide superior service
    for our guests. We also seek to develop competitive advantages
    in specific markets and among specific customer groups.

General

We primarily own and operate casino resorts, which includes
    offering gaming, hotel, dining, entertainment, retail and other
    resort amenities. Over half of our net revenue is derived from
    non-gaming activities, a higher percentage than many of our
    competitors, as our operating philosophy is to provide a
    complete resort experience for our guests, including high
    quality non-gaming amenities for which our guests are willing to
    pay a premium.

As a resort-based company, our operating results are highly
    dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in
    turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and
    other amenities. Since we believe that the number of walk-in
    customers affects the success of our casino resorts, we design
    our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other
    hotels. We also generate a significant portion of our operating
    income from the high-end gaming segment, which can be a cause of
    variability in our results.

Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers
    wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash
    or credit cards. Our resorts, like many in the industry,
    generate significant operating cash flow. Our industry is
    capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our
    resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing,
    fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash
    for future development.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature,
    though a variety of factors can affect the results of any
    interim period, including the timing of major Las Vegas
    conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special
    events for our high-end customers, and the level of play during
    major holidays, including New Year and Chinese New Year. Our
    significant convention and meeting facilities typically allow us
    to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during off-peak
    times, such as mid-week or during traditionally slower leisure
    travel periods, which also leads to better labor utilization.
    Our results do not depend on key individual customers, although
    our success in marketing to customer groups, such as convention
    customers, or the financial health of customer segments, such as
    business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a
    particular country or region, can affect our results.

All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day
    of the year, with the exception of Grand Victoria which operates
    22 hours a day, every day of the year. At our wholly-owned
    resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and
    managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated
    by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or
    leased to third parties. We generally have an operating
    philosophy that favors ownership and management of amenities,
    since guests have direct contact with staff in these areas and
    we prefer to control all aspects of the guest experience;
    however, we do lease space to retail and food and beverage
    operators in certain situations, particularly for branding
    opportunities and where capital investment by us is not
    feasible. We also operate many “managed” outlets,
    utilizing third-party management for specific expertise in areas
    such as restaurants and nightclubs, as well as for branding
    opportunities.

Customers
    and Competition

Our casino resorts generally operate in highly competitive
    environments. We compete against other gaming companies, as well
    as other hospitality and leisure and business travel companies.
    Our primary methods of competing successfully include:

•

Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel
    markets, and operating at superior sites within those markets;

•

Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and
    facilities, including luxurious guestrooms along with premier
    dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;



•

Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated
    employees who provide superior and friendly customer service;

•

Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment
    attractions; and

•

Developing distinctive and memorable marketing and promotional
    programs.

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large
    number of other hotel-casinos in the Las Vegas area, including
    major hotel-casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major
    hotel-casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles
    from the center of the Strip, and several major hotel-casinos
    elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip resorts
    also compete, in part, with each other. According to the Las
    Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, there were
    approximately 149,000 guestrooms in Las Vegas at
    December 31, 2009, up 6% from approximately 141,000 rooms
    at December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, we
    operated approximately 28% of the guestrooms in Las Vegas. Las
    Vegas visitor volume was 36.4 million in 2009, a decrease
    of 3% from the 37.5 million reported for 2008.

The principal segments of the Las Vegas gaming market are
    leisure travel; premium gaming customers; conventions, including
    small meetings, trade associations, and corporate incentive
    programs; and tour and travel. Our high-end wholly-owned
    properties, which include Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas,
    Mandalay Bay, and The Mirage, appeal to the upper end of each
    market segment, balancing their business by using the convention
    and tour and travel segments to fill the mid-week and off-peak
    periods. Our marketing strategy for New York-New York, Luxor and
    Monte Carlo is aimed at attracting middle- to
    upper-middle-income customers, largely from the leisure travel
    and, to a lesser extent, the tour and travel segments. Excalibur
    and Circus Circus Las Vegas generally cater to the
    value-oriented and middle-income leisure travel and tour and
    travel segments.

Outside Las Vegas, our other wholly-owned Nevada operations
    compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and
    larger operations. Our Nevada resorts not located in Las Vegas
    appeal primarily to the value-oriented leisure traveler and the
    value-oriented local customer. A significant portion of our
    customers at these resorts come from California. We believe the
    expansion of Native American gaming in California has had a
    negative impact on all of our Nevada resorts not located on the
    Las Vegas Strip, and additional expansion in California could
    have a further adverse effect on these resorts.

Outside Nevada, our wholly-owned resorts primarily compete for
    customers in local and regional gaming markets, where location
    is a critical factor to success. For instance, in Tunica,
    Mississippi, one of our competitors is closer to Memphis, the
    area’s principal market. In addition, we compete with
    gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure
    destinations in each region. For instance, in Detroit, Michigan
    we also compete with a casino in nearby Windsor, Canada and with
    Native American casinos in Michigan. In Biloxi, Mississippi we
    also compete with regional riverboat and land-based casinos in
    Louisiana, Native American casinos in central Mississippi and
    with casinos in Florida and the Bahamas.

Aria at CityCenter appeals to the upper end of each market
    segment. Our other unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for
    customers against casino resorts in their respective markets.
    Much like our wholly-owned resorts, our unconsolidated
    affiliates compete through the quality of amenities, the value
    of the experience offered to guests, and the location of their
    resorts. Aria, which we manage and own 50% of through a joint
    venture, also competes against our wholly-owned resorts.

Our casino resorts also compete for customers with hotel-casino
    operations located in other areas of the United States and other
    parts of the world, and for leisure and business travelers with
    non-gaming tourist destinations such as Hawaii, Florida and
    cruise ships. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent
    with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card
    parlors, and other forms of legalized gaming in the United
    States.

Marketing

We advertise on radio, television and billboards and in
    newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the
    United States and overseas, as well as on the Internet and by
    direct mail. We also advertise through our regional marketing
    offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. A key
    element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal
    contact by our marketing personnel. Direct marketing is also
    important in the convention



segment. We maintain Internet websites to inform customers about
    our resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms, make
    restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets. We also
    operate call centers to allow customer contact by phone to make
    hotel and restaurant reservations and purchase show tickets.

We utilize our world-class golf courses in marketing programs at
    our Las Vegas Strip resorts. Our major Las Vegas resorts offer
    luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at Shadow
    Creek in North Las Vegas. In connection with our marketing
    activities, we also invite our premium gaming customers to play
    Shadow Creek on a complimentary basis. We also use Primm Valley
    Golf Club for marketing purposes at our Las Vegas Strip resorts.
    Additionally, marketing efforts at Beau Rivage benefit from
    Fallen Oak golf course just 20 minutes north of Beau Rivage.

Employees
    and Management

We believe that knowledgeable, friendly and dedicated employees
    are a key success factor in the casino resort industry.
    Therefore, we invest heavily in recruiting, training and
    retaining our employees, as well as seeking to hire and promote
    the strongest management team possible. We have numerous
    programs, both at the corporate and business unit level,
    designed to achieve these objectives. For example, our diversity
    initiative extends throughout our company, and focuses on the
    unique strengths of our individuals combined with a culture of
    working together to achieve greater performance. Our diversity
    program has been widely recognized and has received numerous
    awards. We believe our development programs, such as the MGM
    Grand University and various leadership and management training
    programs, are

best-in-class

among our industry peers.

Technology

We utilize technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our
    operations. Our Players Club program links our major resorts,
    and consolidates all slots and table games activity for
    customers with a Players Club account. Customers qualify for
    benefits across all of the participating resorts, regardless of
    where they play. We believe that our Players Club enables us to
    more effectively market to our customers.

We utilize server-based slot machine technology at Aria which
    gives us the ability to present Players Club data and other
    property marketing directly to the customer. In addition,
    server-based gaming allows us to quickly convert the games
    offered on machines on the casino floor to meet customer
    requests and gives us the ability to dynamically change machine
    wagering allowing us to maximize our profits based on demand.

Technology is an important part of our strategy in non-gaming
    and administrative operations. Our hotel systems include yield
    management software programs which allow us to maximize
    occupancy and room rates. Additionally, these systems capture
    charges made by our customers during their stay, including
    allowing customers of our resorts to charge meals and services
    at our other resorts to their hotel accounts.

Internal
    Controls

We have a strong culture of compliance, driven by our history in
    the highly regulated gaming industry and our belief that
    compliance is a value-added activity. Our system of internal
    controls and procedures — including internal control
    over financial reporting — is designed to ensure
    reliable and accurate financial records, transparent
    disclosures, compliance with laws and regulations, and
    protection of our assets. Our internal controls start at the
    source of business transactions, and we have rigorous
    enforcement at both the business unit and corporate level.

Our corporate management also reviews each of our businesses on
    a regular basis and we have a corporate internal audit function
    that performs reviews regarding gaming compliance, internal
    controls over financial reporting, and operations.

In addition, we maintain a compliance committee that administers
    our company-wide compliance plan. The compliance plan is in
    place to ensure compliance with gaming and other laws applicable
    to our operations in all jurisdictions, including performing
    background investigations on our current and potential
    employees, directors and vendors as well as thorough review of
    proposed transactions and associations.



In connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our
    casinos, we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all
    receipts and disbursements and other activities, including cash
    transaction reporting which is essential in our industry. Our
    controls surrounding cash transactions include locked cash boxes
    on the casino floor, daily cash counts performed by employees
    who are independent of casino operations, constant observation
    and supervision of the gaming area, observation and recording of
    gaming and other areas by closed-circuit television, constant
    computer monitoring of our slot machines, and timely analysis of
    deviations from expected performance.

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games
    volume at Aria, Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and
    The Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to
    the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at
    certain of those casinos as well. We also maintain strict
    controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue
    collection from those customers who fail to timely pay their
    marker balances. These collection efforts are similar to those
    used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue
    customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and
    delinquency notices, direct personal contact and the use of
    outside collection agencies and civil litigation.

In Nevada, Mississippi, Michigan, New Jersey and Illinois,
    amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are
    enforceable under state laws. All other states are required to
    enforce a judgment for amounts owed for markers entered into in
    Nevada, Mississippi, New Jersey, Illinois or Michigan which are
    not timely paid, pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of
    the U.S. Constitution. Amounts owed for markers which are
    not timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign
    countries, but the U.S. assets of foreign customers may be
    reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.

Risks
    Associated With Our Operating Strategy

Certain principal risk factors relating to our operating
    strategy are:

•

Our guestroom, dining and entertainment prices are often higher
    than those of most of our competitors in each market, although
    we believe that the quality of our facilities and services is
    also higher;

•

Our hotel-casinos compete to some extent with each other for
    customers. Aria, Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and
    The Mirage, in particular, compete for some of the same premium
    gaming customers; MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay also
    compete to some extent against each other in the large-scale
    conference and convention business; and

•

Additional new hotel-casinos and expansion projects at existing
    Las Vegas hotel-casinos are under construction or have been
    proposed. We are unable to determine the extent to which
    increased competition will affect our future operating results.

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below for a more
    detailed discussion of these and other risk factors.

Sustainable
    Growth and Leveraging Our Brand and Management Assets

In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on
    managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts, spending
    on new resorts or initiatives, repaying long-term debt, and
    returning capital to shareholders. Historically, we have
    actively allocated capital to each of these areas. We believe
    there are reasonable investments for us to make in new
    initiatives that will provide returns in excess of the other
    options, although these decisions have been significantly
    affected by the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, which limited
    our access to capital at prices low enough to finance all of our
    new initiatives.

We regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition
    opportunities in both the domestic and international markets,
    but cannot at this time determine the likelihood of proceeding
    with specific development opportunities. Opportunities we
    evaluate may include the ownership, management and operation of
    gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada or in states
    other than Nevada or outside of the United States. We may
    undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation
    with one or more third parties. Due to the financial crisis in
    2008 and 2009, we postponed certain development projects
    including a resort complex on our

72-acre

site
    in Atlantic City and an integrated resort to be located on the
    southwest corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara Avenue with
    Kerzner International and Istithmar. We do not expect to move
    forward with these projects until general economic



conditions, market conditions, and our financial position
    improve, and in the case of the Atlantic City development, we do
    not intend to pursue this development for the foreseeable
    future — see “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
    for further discussion of the related impairment charge.

We also seek to leverage our management expertise and
    well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and
    international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of
    our brands, particularly the “MGM Grand,”
    “Bellagio,” and “Skylofts” brands, are well
    suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming
    developments. We formed MGM MIRAGE Hospitality, LLC
    (“Hospitality”), which includes MGM MIRAGE Global
    Gaming Development, principally focused on international gaming
    expansion. The purpose of Hospitality is to source strategic
    resort development and management opportunities, both gaming and
    non-gaming, focusing on international opportunities, which we
    believe offer the greatest opportunity for future growth. We
    have hired senior personnel with established backgrounds in the
    development and management of international hospitality
    operations to maximize the profit potential of
    Hospitality’s operations.

MGM Grand
    Abu Dhabi

In November 2007, we announced plans to develop MGM Grand Abu
    Dhabi, a multi-billion dollar, large-scale, mixed-use
    development that will serve as an incoming gateway to Abu Dhabi,
    a United Arab Emirate, located at a prominent downtown
    waterfront site on Abu Dhabi Island. The project will be wholly
    owned by Mubadala Development Company; we do not have a capital
    investment in this project. We currently provide development
    management services for the project, and upon opening, will
    manage the project under a long-term management services
    agreement. The initial phase will utilize 50 acres and
    consist of MGM Grand, Bellagio and Skylofts hotels, and a
    variety of luxury residential offerings. Additionally, the
    development will feature a major entertainment facility,
    high-end retail shops, and world-class dining and convention
    facilities. The first phase of the development is expected to
    open in 2014.

Mashantucket
    Pequot Tribal Nation

We have an agreement with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation
    (“MPTN”), which owns and operates Foxwoods Casino
    Resort in Mashantucket, Connecticut for the casino resort owned
    and operated by MPTN located adjacent to the Foxwoods Casino
    Resort to carry the “MGM Grand” brand name. We earn a
    fee for MPTN to use the “MGM Grand” name.

China

We have formed a joint venture with the Diaoyutai State
    Guesthouse in Beijing, People’s Republic of China, to
    develop luxury non-gaming hotels and resorts in China, initially
    targeting prime locations, including Beijing, in the
    People’s Republic of China. We have signed three technical
    and management services agreements for resorts which will open
    over the next four years. We have minimal capital investments
    required for such projects.

Vietnam

In November 2008, we and Asian Coast Development Ltd. announced
    plans to develop MGM Grand Ho Tram, which is expected to open in
    2012. MGM Grand Ho Tram will anchor a multi-property complex on
    the Ho Tram Strip in the Ba Ria Vung Tau Province in southwest
    Vietnam. MGM Grand Ho Tram will be owned and financed by Asian
    Coast Development Ltd. and we will provide development
    assistance and operate the luxury integrated resort upon
    completion. We have no capital investment in this project.



Risks
    Associated With Our Growth and Brand Management
    Strategies

Certain principal risk factors relating to our growth strategy
    are:

•

Development and operation of gaming facilities in new or
    existing jurisdictions are subject to many contingencies, some
    of which are outside of our control and may include the passage
    of appropriate gaming legislation, the issuance of necessary
    permits, licenses and approvals, the availability of appropriate
    financing and the satisfaction of other conditions;

•

Operations in which we may engage in foreign territories are
    subject to risks pertaining to international operations that may
    include financial risks such as foreign currency, adverse tax
    consequences, inability to adequately enforce our rights; and
    regulatory and political risks such as foreign government
    regulations, general geopolitical risks including political and
    economic instability, hostilities with neighboring countries,
    and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and

•

Expansion projects involve risks and uncertainties. For example,
    the design, timing and costs of the projects may change and are
    subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects to the extent
    we are responsible for financing such projects.

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” below for a more
    detailed discussion of these and other risk factors.

Employees
    and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    46,000 full-time and 16,000 part-time employees; 7,000
    and 2,100 of which, respectively, relate to CityCenter. At that
    date, we had collective bargaining contracts with unions
    covering approximately 31,000 of our employees. We consider our
    employee relations to be good. The collective bargaining
    agreement covering approximately 4,000 employees at MGM
    Grand Las Vegas expired in 2008. We have signed an extension of
    such agreement and are currently negotiating a new agreement.
    The collective bargaining agreements covering most of our other
    union employees expire in 2012.

Regulation
    and Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain
    our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.
    Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the
    laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is
    located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the
    responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners,
    managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming
    operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result
    in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.

A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are
    subject is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K,

which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local
    laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These
    laws and regulations include, but are not limited to,
    restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages,
    environmental matters, employees, currency transactions,
    taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and
    advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be
    interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and
    regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or
    regulations, or material differences in interpretations by
    courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our
    operating results.

Forward-Looking
    Statements

This

Form 10-K

and our 2009 Annual Report to Stockholders contain
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as
    “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,”
    “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,”
    “expects,” and similar references to future periods.
    Examples of forward-looking statements include, but are not
    limited to, statements we make regarding our ability to generate
    significant cash flow and amounts that we expect to receive in
    federal tax refunds, amounts we will invest in capital
    expenditures, amounts we will pay under the CityCenter
    completion guarantee and receive from the sale of residential
    units at CityCenter. The foregoing is not a complete list of all
    forward-looking statements we make.



Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations
    and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other
    future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to
    the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks,
    and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our
    actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by
    the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of
    historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future
    performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of
    these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could
    cause actual results to differ materially from those in the
    forward-looking statements include regional, national or global
    political, economic, business, competitive, market, and
    regulatory conditions and the following:

•

our substantial indebtedness and significant financial
    commitments;

•

current and future credit market conditions and general economic
    and business conditions, which could adversely affect our
    ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make
    planned expenditures;

•

our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain
    restrictions which could affect our ability to operate our
    business and our liquidity;

•

competition with other destination travel locations throughout
    the United States and the world;

•

the fact that several of our businesses are subject to extensive
    regulation; the cost or failure to comply with these regulations
    would affect our business;

•

effects of economic conditions and market conditions in the
    markets in which we operate;

•

extreme weather conditions may cause property damage or
    interrupt our business;

•

changes in energy prices;

•

our concentration of gaming resorts on the Las Vegas Strip;

•

leisure and business travel is susceptible to global
    geopolitical events, such as terrorism or acts of war;

•

investing through partnerships or joint ventures, including
    CityCenter and MGM Grand Macau, decreases our ability to manage
    risk;

•

plans for future construction can be affected by a variety of
    factors, including timing delays and legal challenges;

•

the outcome of any ongoing and future litigation;

•

the fact that Tracinda Corporation owns a significant portion of
    our stock and may have interests that differ from the interests
    of our other shareholders; and

•

a significant portion of our labor force is covered by
    collective bargaining agreements.

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this

Form 10-K

and our 2009 Annual Report speaks only as of the date on which
    it is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual
    results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not
    possible for us to predict all of them. We undertake no
    obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement,
    whether as a result of new information, future developments or
    otherwise, except as may be required by law.

You should also be aware that while we from time to time
    communicate with securities analysts, we do not disclose to them
    any material non-public information, internal forecasts or other
    confidential business information. Therefore, you should not
    assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any
    analyst, irrespective of the content of the statement or report.
    To the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain
    projections, forecasts or opinions, those reports are not our
    responsibility.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events
    described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any
    other of our filings with the SEC could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider
    carefully, among other things, the risks described below.

Risks
    Related to our Substantial Indebtedness

•

Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial
    commitments could adversely affect our operations and financial
    results and impact our ability to satisfy our
    obligations.

As of December 31, 2009, we had
    approximately $14.1 billion of indebtedness. Giving effect
    to the subsequent repayment of $1.6 billion under our
    senior credit facility on January 4, 2010, we had
    $12.5 billion of indebtedness including $4.0 billion
    outstanding under our $5.5 billion senior credit facility.
    We have no other existing sources of borrowing availability,
    except to the extent we pay down further amounts outstanding
    under the senior credit facility. We have approximately
    $1.1 billion of 2010 senior note maturities and estimated
    interest payments of $1.0 billion in 2010 based on
    outstanding debt as of December 31, 2009. Any increase in
    the interest rates applicable to our existing or future
    borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and
    reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity
    needs. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for
    discussion of our liquidity and financial position. In addition,
    our substantial indebtedness and significant financial
    commitments could have important negative consequences,
    including:

—

increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry
    conditions;

—

limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in
    our business and industry;

—

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds;

—

making it more difficult for us to make payments on our
    indebtedness; and

—

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other less
    leveraged competitors.



Moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned
    and managed properties to remain attractive and competitive we
    must periodically invest significant capital to keep the
    properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished, which
    requires an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we
    cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations,
    funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Similarly, future
    development projects and acquisitions could require significant
    capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt,
    guarantees of third-party debt, or the incurrence of contingent
    liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. Events over the
    past two years, including the failures and near failures of
    financial services companies and the decrease in liquidity and
    available capital, have negatively affected the capital markets.

•

Current and future economic and credit market conditions
    could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our
    indebtedness and to make planned
    expenditures.

Our ability to make payments on,
    and to refinance, our indebtedness and to fund planned or
    committed capital expenditures and investments in joint
    ventures, such as CityCenter, depends on our ability to generate
    cash flow in the future and our ability to borrow under our
    senior credit facility to the extent of available borrowings. If
    adverse regional and national economic conditions persist,
    worsen, or fail to improve significantly, we could experience
    decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases
    in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate
    sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy
    the financial and other restrictive covenants which we are
    subject to under our indebtedness. We cannot assure you that our
    business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or
    that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior
    credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our
    indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2010
    and 2011. Our ability to timely refinance and replace such
    indebtedness will depend upon the foregoing as well as on
    continued and sustained improvements in financial markets. If we
    are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis, we
    might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of
    certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other
    investments. There is no assurance that any of these
    alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on
    satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous
    to note holders, or on terms that would not require us to breach
    the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt
    agreements.

•

The agreements governing our senior credit facility and other
    senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that
    could significantly affect our ability to operate our business,
    as well as significantly affect our liquidity and therefore
    could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

Covenants governing our senior credit
    facility and other senior indebtedness restrict, among other
    things, our ability to:

—

pay dividends or distributions, repurchase or issue equity,
    prepay debt or make certain investments;

—

incur additional debt or issue certain disqualified stock and
    preferred stock;

—

incur liens on assets;

—

pledge or sell assets or consolidate with another company or
    sell all or substantially all assets;

—

enter into transactions with affiliates;

—

allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets; and

—

enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by
    events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or
    obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a
    default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger
    acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger
    cross defaults under other agreements governing our long-term
    indebtedness. Any default under the senior credit facility or
    the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect
    our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations
    and our ability to make payments on our debt, and could force us
    to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.



Risks
    Related to our Business

•

We face significant competition with respect to destination
    travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the
    industries in which we compete, and failure to effectively
    compete could materially adversely affect our business,
    financial condition results of operations and cash
    flow.

The hotel, resort and casino industries are
    highly competitive. We do not believe that our competition is
    limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort and
    gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our
    customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or
    hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination
    locations, competition will increase. Major competitors,
    including new entrants, have either recently expanded their
    hotel room capacity or are currently expanding their capacity or
    constructing new resorts in Las Vegas and Macau. Also, the
    growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas, including
    California, has increased the competition faced by our
    operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. In particular, as large
    scale gaming operations in Native American tribal lands has
    increased, particularly in California, competition has
    increased. In addition, competition could increase if changes in
    gaming restrictions in the U.S. and elsewhere result in the
    addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our
    customers than our casinos, such as has happened in California.
    In addition to competition with other hotels, resorts, and
    casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of
    the markets in which we operate. Our failure to compete
    successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract
    customers could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flow.

•

Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the
    cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations
    may adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

Our ownership and operation of gaming
    facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries,
    states, and provinces in which we operate. These laws,
    regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to
    jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility,
    financial stability and character of the owners and managers of
    gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or
    involved in gaming operations. As such, our gaming regulators
    can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or
    business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or,
    alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction. In
    addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our
    domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates in any
    jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to
    continue operating in other jurisdictions. For a summary of
    gaming and other regulations that affect our business, see
    “Regulation and Licensing.” The regulatory environment
    in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any
    such change could have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations. In addition, we are subject to various gaming
    taxes, which are subject to possible increase at any time.
    Increases in gaming taxation could also adversely affect our
    results.

As a result of the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement
    (the “DGE”) investigation of our relationship with our
    joint venture partner in Macau we are currently involved in
    constructive settlement discussions with the DGE under which we
    would agree to sell our 50% ownership interest in Borgata and
    related leased land in Atlantic City. If we are unable to
    effectuate such a settlement with the DGE, we may still be
    subject to action by the New Jersey Casino Control Commission
    related to the DGE’s report — see
    “Item 3. Legal Proceedings.”

•

Our business is affected by economic and market conditions in
    the markets in which we operate and in the locations in which
    our customers reside.

Our business is
    particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer
    spending and corporate spending on conventions and business
    development. Economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the
    perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic
    conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotel and casino
    resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury
    amenities we offer. In addition, changes in discretionary
    consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by
    factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstable job
    market, perceived or actual disposable consumer income and
    wealth, or fears of war and future acts of terrorism. Aria,
    Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage may
    be affected by economic conditions in the Far East, and all of
    our Nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the
    United States, and California in particular.



A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic
    condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is
    likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts, which
    would adversely affect our operating results. For example, the
    recent recession and downturn in consumer and corporate spending
    has had a negative impact on our results of operations. In
    addition, the weak housing and real estate
    market— both generally and in Nevada
    particularly — has negatively impacted
    CityCenter’s ability to sell residential units.

•

Extreme weather conditions may cause property damage or
    interrupt business, which could harm our business and results of
    operations.

Certain of our casino properties are
    located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather
    conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes. Such
    extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage
    our properties, and reduce the number of customers who visit our
    facilities in such areas. Although we maintain both property and
    business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme
    weather conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and
    limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage
    period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you that
    we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if
    at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather
    conditions. Furthermore, such extreme weather conditions may
    interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may
    cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an
    indefinite period.

•

Our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a
    rise in energy prices could harm our operating
    results.

We are a large consumer of electricity
    and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have
    an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly,
    increases in energy costs, such as those experienced in 2007 and
    2008, may have a negative impact on our operating results.
    Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices which
    affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our
    resorts and a reduction in our revenues.

•

Because our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las
    Vegas Strip, we will be subject to greater risks than a gaming
    company that is more geographically
    diversified.

Given that our major resorts are
    concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business may be
    significantly affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism
    industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services
    and the impact of any events which disrupt air travel to and
    from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot
    control the number or frequency of flights into or out of Las
    Vegas, but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion or
    our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines, such as
    those implemented in 2008 and 2009 as a result of higher fuel
    prices and lower demand, can impact the number of visitors to
    our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal interstate
    highway between Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large
    number of our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that
    highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the
    number of customers who visit our facilities.

•

Leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, are
    particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as
    terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility.

We
    are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by
    air. Events such as those on September 11, 2001 can create
    economic and political uncertainties that could adversely impact
    our business levels. Since most of our customers travel by air
    to our Las Vegas and Macau properties, any further terrorist
    act, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual
    or perceived threat to the security of travel by air, could
    adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations
    and cash flows. Furthermore, although we have been able to
    purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist
    acts, insurance coverage against loss or business interruption
    resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be
    unavailable.

•

Investing through partnerships or joint ventures including
    CityCenter and MGM Grand Macau decreases our ability to manage
    risk.

In addition to acquiring or developing
    hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our
    business directly, we have from time to time invested, and
    expect to continue to invest, as a co-venturer. Joint venturers
    often have shared control over the operation of the joint
    venture assets. Therefore, joint venture investments may involve
    risks such as the possibility that the co-venturer in an
    investment might become bankrupt or not have the financial
    resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business
    interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business
    interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary
    to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or
    objectives.



Consequently, actions by a co-venturer might subject hotels and
    resorts owned by the joint venture to additional risk. Further,
    we may be unable to take action without the approval of our
    joint venture partners. Alternatively, our joint venture
    partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without
    our consent. Additionally, should a joint venture partner become
    bankrupt, we could become liable for our partner’s or
    co-venturer’s share of joint venture liabilities.

For instance, if CityCenter, 50% owned and managed by us, is
    unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our partners
    are unable to support future funding requirements, as necessary,
    or if CityCenter’s $1.8 billion senior secured credit
    facility is terminated for any reason, such event could have
    adverse financial consequences to us. Such credit facility
    includes provisions limiting the amount of permitted
    construction liens, and also includes leverage and interest
    coverage covenants which will go into effect during 2011. In
    accordance with our joint venture agreement and the CityCenter
    credit facility, we provided a cost overrun guarantee which is
    secured by our interests in the assets of Circus Circus Las
    Vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land. In addition, the
    operation of a joint venture is subject to inherent risk due to
    the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach
    agreements on material matters.

Also, the operation of MGM Grand Macau, 50% owned by us, is
    subject to unique risks, including risks related to:
    (a) Macau’s regulatory framework; (b) our ability
    to adapt to the different regulatory and gaming environment in
    Macau while remaining in compliance with the requirements of the
    gaming regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we
    currently operate, as well as other applicable federal, state,
    or local laws in the United States and Macau; (c) potential
    political or economic instability; and (d) the extreme
    weather conditions in the region.

Furthermore, such operations in Macau or any future operations
    in which we may engage in any other foreign territories are
    subject to risk pertaining to international operations. These
    may include financial risks, such as foreign economy, adverse
    tax consequences, and inability to adequately enforce our
    rights. These may also include regulatory and political risks,
    such as foreign government regulations, general geopolitical
    risks such as political and economic instability, hostilities
    with neighboring counties, and changes in diplomatic and trade
    relationships.

•

Our plans for future construction can be affected by a number
    of factors, including time delays in obtaining necessary
    governmental permits and approvals and legal
    challenges.

With respect to any development
    project, we may make changes in project scope, budgets and
    schedules for competitive, aesthetic or other reasons, and these
    changes may also result from circumstances beyond our control.
    These circumstances include weather interference, shortages of
    materials and labor, work stoppages, labor disputes, unforeseen
    engineering, environmental or geological problems, unanticipated
    cost increases, the existence of acceptable market conditions
    and demand for the completed project, changes and concessions
    required by governmental or regulatory authorities, and delays
    in obtaining, or inability to obtain, all licenses, permits and
    authorizations required to complete

and/or

operate the project. Any of these circumstances could give rise
    to delays or cost overruns. Major expansion projects at our
    existing resorts may also result in disruption of our business
    during the construction period. Our failure to complete any new
    development or expansion project as planned, on schedule, within
    budget or in a manner that generates anticipated profits, could
    have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

•

We face risks related to pending claims that have been, or
    future claims that may be, brought against
    us.

Claims have been brought against us and our
    subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and additional legal
    and tax claims arise from time to time. We may not be successful
    in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal
    proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that
    could significantly impact our business, financial condition and
    results of operations. Please see the further discussion in
    Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.”



•

Tracinda Corporation owns a significant amount of our common
    stock and may have interests that differ from the interests of
    other holders of our stock.

As of
    December 31, 2009, Tracinda Corporation beneficially owned
    approximately 37% of our outstanding common stock, all of which
    shares owned by Tracinda have been pledged under its bank credit
    facility. Tracinda may be required in the future, under its bank
    credit facility, to liquidate some or all of such pledged shares
    if the value of the collateral falls below a specified level. A
    liquidation of this nature of sufficient size may trigger a
    “change of control” under certain of the instruments
    governing our outstanding indebtedness. Upon a change of
    control, the lenders’ obligation to make advances under our
    senior credit facility may be terminated at the option of the
    lenders.

In addition, Tracinda may be able to exercise significant
    influence over MGM MIRAGE as a result of its significant
    ownership of our outstanding common stock. As a result, actions
    requiring stockholder approval that may be supported by other
    stockholders could be effectively blocked by Tracinda
    Corporation.

•

A significant portion of our labor force is covered by
    collective bargaining agreements. Work stoppages and other labor
    problems could negatively affect our business and results of
    operations.

Approximately 31,000 of our
    62,000 employees are covered by collective bargaining
    agreements. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees could
    have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, wage and
    or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be
    significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results
    of operations. The collective bargaining agreement covering
    approximately 4,000 employees at MGM Grand Las Vegas
    expired in 2008. We have signed an extension of such agreement
    and are currently negotiating a new agreement. In addition, to
    the extent that our non-union employees join unions, we would
    have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

New Jersey regulatory review of Macau investment.

In its June 2005 report to the New Jersey Casino Control
    Commission (the “New Jersey Commission”) on the
    application of Borgata for renewal of its casino license, the
    DGE stated that it was conducting an investigation of our
    relationship with our joint venture partner in Macau and that
    the DGE would report to the New Jersey Commission any material
    information it deemed appropriate.

On May 18, 2009, the New Jersey Division of Gaming
    Enforcement (“DGE”) issued a report to the New Jersey
    Commission on its investigation. In the report, the DGE
    recommended, among other things, that: (i) our Macau joint
    venture partner be found to be unsuitable; (ii) we be
    directed to disengage ourselves from any business association
    with our Macau joint venture partner; (iii) our due
    diligence/compliance efforts be found to be deficient; and
    (iv) the New Jersey Commission hold a hearing to address
    the report.



The DGE is responsible for investigating licensees and
    prosecuting matters before the New Jersey Commission.
    However, the report is merely a recommendation and is not
    binding on the New Jersey Commission, which has sole
    responsibility and authority for deciding all regulatory and
    licensing matters. The New Jersey Commission has not yet
    taken any action with respect to the report, but on
    July 27, 2009, the DGE submitted a letter to the
    New Jersey Commission recommending that the New Jersey
    Commission reopen the licensing of Borgata to address the
    ongoing suitability of the Company as a licensee; under New
    Jersey regulations, the New Jersey Commission is obligated
    to reopen the licensing. This was a procedural step required by
    the New Jersey Casino Control Act that does not represent a
    finding as to the issues raised by the DGE. The Company will
    have the opportunity to respond to the DGE report in an open
    public proceeding.

We are currently involved in constructive settlement discussions
    with the DGE, which have centered on us placing our 50%
    ownership interest in the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa
    and related leased land in Atlantic City into a divestiture
    trust for which we would be the sole economic beneficiary. Any
    settlement is subject to both DGE and New Jersey Commission
    approval.

Securities and derivative litigation.

Six lawsuits have been filed in Nevada federal and state court
    against the Company and various of its former and current
    directors and officers by various shareholders alleging federal
    securities laws violations

and/or

related breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with
    statements allegedly made by the defendants during the period
    August 2007 through the date of such filings. In general, the
    lawsuits assert the same or similar allegations, including that
    defendants artificially inflated the Company’s common stock
    price by knowingly making materially false and misleading
    statements and omissions to the investing public about the
    Company’s financial statements and condition, operations,
    CityCenter, and the intrinsic value of the Company’s common
    stock; that these alleged misstatements and omissions thereby
    enabled certain Company insiders to derive personal profit from
    the sale of Company common stock to the public; that defendants
    caused plaintiffs and other shareholders to purchase MGM MIRAGE
    common stock at artificially inflated prices; and that
    defendants imprudently implemented a share repurchase program
    during the relevant time period to the detriment of the Company.

The lawsuits are:

Robert Lowinger v. MGM MIRAGE, et al.

Filed
    August 19, 2009. Case No. 2:09-cv-01558-RCL-LRL,
    U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada.

Filed
    October 19, 2009. Case No. 2:09-cv-02011-LRH-RJJ,
    U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. These
    putative class actions name MGM MIRAGE and certain former and
    current directors and officers and allege violations of
    Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder. On November 4, 2009, the Court
    entered an Order consolidating for all purposes the Lowinger and
    Hovhannisyan actions before the Honorable Robert C. Jones, with
    such consolidated actions captioned as “In re MGM MIRAGE
    Securities Litigation.”

    al.

Filed September 14, 2009. Case

No. 2:09-cv-01815-KJD-RJJ,

U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. This
    purported shareholder derivative action against certain former
    and current directors and officers alleges, among other things,
    breach of fiduciary duty by defendants’ asserted improper
    financial reporting, insider selling and misappropriation of
    information; and unjust enrichment. MGM MIRAGE is named as a
    nominal defendant.

Regina Shamberger v. J. Terrence Lanni, et
    al.

Filed September 14, 2009. Case

No. 2:09-cv-01817-PMP-GWF,

U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. This
    purported shareholder derivative action against certain former
    and current directors and officers alleges, among other things,
    breach of fiduciary duty by defendants’ asserted insider
    selling and misappropriation of information; waste of corporate
    assets; and unjust enrichment. MGM MIRAGE is named as a nominal
    defendant.

Charles Kim v. James J. Murren, et al.

Filed
    September 23, 2009. Case No.

A-09-599937-C,

Eighth Judicial District Court, Clark County, Nevada. This
    purported shareholder derivative action against certain former
    and current directors and officers alleges, among other things,
    breach of fiduciary duty by defendants’ asserted
    dissemination of false and misleading statements to the public,
    failure to maintain internal controls, and failure to properly
    oversee and manage the Company; unjust enrichment; abuse of
    control; gross mismanagement; and waste of corporate assets. MGM
    MIRAGE is named as a nominal defendant.



Sanjay Israni v. Robert H. Baldwin, et
    al.

Filed September 25, 2009. Case

No. CV-09-02914,

Second Judicial District Court, Washoe County, Nevada. This
    purported shareholder derivative action against certain former
    and current directors and a Company officer alleges, among other
    things, breach of fiduciary duty by defendants’ asserted
    insider selling and misappropriation of information; abuse of
    control; gross mismanagement; waste of corporate assets; unjust
    enrichment; and contribution and indemnification. MGM MIRAGE is
    named as a nominal defendant.

The lawsuits seek unspecified compensatory damages, restitution
    and disgorgement of alleged profits, injunctive relief related
    to corporate governance

and/or

attorneys’ fees and costs. The Company intends to
    vigorously defend itself against these claims.

Other

We and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other
    lawsuits, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to
    our business. We do not believe that the outcome of such pending
    litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a material
    adverse effect on the Company.

There were approximately 4,348 record holders of our common

We have not paid dividends on our common stock in the last two
    fiscal years. As a holding company with no independent
    operations, our ability to pay dividends will depend upon the
    receipt of dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries.
    Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains financial
    covenants that could restrict our ability to pay dividends. Our
    Board of Directors periodically reviews our policy with respect
    to dividends, and any determination to pay dividends in the
    future will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.

Share
    Repurchases

Our share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase
    programs approved by our Board of Directors and publicly
    announced. We did not repurchase shares of our common stock
    during the quarter ended December 31, 2009. The maximum
    number of shares available for repurchase under our May 2008
    repurchase program was 20 million as of December 31,
    2009.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Executive
    Overview

Liquidity
    and Financial Position

We have significant indebtedness and we have significant
    financial commitments in 2010. On December 30, 2009, we
    borrowed the $1.6 billion then available to us under our
    senior credit facility in order to increase our capacity for
    issuing additional senior secured notes under our existing
    public notes indentures; we repaid this borrowing on
    January 4, 2010. Therefore, as of December 31, 2009,
    we had a higher than normal cash balance of $2.1 billion.
    As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately
    $14.1 billion of total long-term debt including amounts
    outstanding under our senior credit facility. As discussed
    below, on February 25, 2010, we entered into an agreement
    amending our senior credit facility, which, among other things,
    provides for an extension of the maturity date for a portion of
    our senior credit facility (subject to the fulfillment of
    certain conditions), provided for a reduction in the credit
    exposures of lenders agreeing to such extensions, and an
    increase in applicable interest rates payable to such lenders.

As of December 31, 2009 our financial obligations in 2010
    included $1.1 billion related to maturities of long-term
    debt; $1.0 billion in estimated interest payments on
    outstanding debt; and an estimated $394 million under our
    CityCenter completion guarantee which we expect to be partially
    offset by up to $244 million in proceeds from the sale of
    residential units at CityCenter, though the timing of receipt of
    such proceeds is uncertain. In addition, we expect to invest
    approximately $250 million in currently uncommitted capital
    expenditures at our resorts in 2010.

Giving effect to the January 4, 2010 repayment, we had
    approximately $1.6 billion available under our senior
    credit facility to fund our 2010 obligations as of
    December 31, 2009. We have no other existing sources of
    borrowing availability, except to the extent we reduce amounts
    outstanding under the senior credit facility. In addition, we
    historically have generated significant cash flows from
    operations; we generated approximately $1.4 billion in cash
    flows from operations before deducting cash paid for interest in
    2009. We also expect to receive tax refunds of approximately
    $385 million during 2010.

On February 25, 2010 we entered into an amendment (the
    “Amendment”) to our senior credit facility which:

•

Provides us a period through June 30, 2010 to raise
    sufficient capital to make the “Required Prepayments”
    described below;

•

Permits us to issue not more than $850 million of secured
    indebtedness to finance all or a portion of the Required
    Prepayments;

•

Permits us to transfer our 50% interest in Borgata and certain
    land and cash into a trust — see “Borgata”
    below; and

•

Requires the payment of an amendment fee to all lenders under
    our credit facility.

Pursuant to the Amendment, a restatement of our senior credit
    facility (the “Restated Loan Agreement”) will become
    effective upon making of the Required Prepayments and
    satisfaction of certain documentary conditions provided that
    these occur no later than June 30, 2010.

The Restated Loan Agreement:

•

Requires us to make a 20% reduction in credit exposures of those
    of our lenders which have agreed to extend their commitments,
    other than lenders which have waived such reduction (the
    “Required Prepayments” —  approximately
    $820 million);

•

Subject to the making of the Required Prepayments and the
    fulfillment of certain other conditions, re-tranches the senior
    credit facility so that approximately $1.4 billion of
    revolving loans and commitments will be effectively converted
    into term loans, leaving a revolving credit commitment of
    $2.0 billion, approximately $300 million of which will
    mature in October 2011;



•

Requires us to repay in full the approximately $1.2 billion
    owed to lenders which have not agreed to extend their
    commitments on or before the existing maturity date in October
    2011;

•

Extends (subject to certain conditions) the maturity date for
    the remaining approximately $3.6 billion of the loans and
    lending commitments (adjusted for the Required Prepayments)
    under the credit facility through February 21, 2014;

•

Provides for extension fees and a 100 basis point increase
    in interest rate for extending lenders; and

•

Continues the existing minimum EBITDA and maximum annual capital
    expenditure convenants with periodic step-ups during the
    extension period.

In addition, the Restated Loan Agreement will allow us to issue
    unsecured debt and equity securities to refinance indebtedness
    maturing prior to October 3, 2011 and the $1.2 billion
    portion of the obligations owed to non-extending Lenders.
    Following the repayment of such lenders and the fulfillment of
    certain other conditions, the maturity of the balance of the
    senior credit facility will be extended to February 21,
    2014 and the Restated Loan Agreement will thereafter permit us
    to issue unsecured debt and equity securities to refinance
    indebtedness which matures prior to the maturity date of the
    extended facilities. However, (a) indebtedness in amounts
    issued in excess of $250 million over such interim
    maturities requires ratable prepayment of the credit facilities
    in an amount equal to 50% of the net cash proceeds of such
    excess, and (b) equity amounts issued in excess of
    $500 million over such interim maturities require ratable
    prepayment of the credit facilities in an amount equal to 50% of
    the net cash proceeds of such excess.

Current
    Operations

At December 31, 2009, our operations consisted of 15
    wholly-owned casino resorts and 50% investments in five other
    casino resorts, including:

Las Vegas, Nevada:

CityCenter (50% owned and managed by us), Bellagio, MGM Grand
    Las Vegas,

Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Excalibur,
    Monte Carlo

and Circus Circus Las Vegas.

Other:

Circus Circus Reno and Silver Legacy (50% owned) in Reno,
    Nevada;

Gold Strike in Jean, Nevada; Railroad Pass in Henderson, Nevada;
    MGM Grand Detroit

in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi and
    Gold Strike Tunica

in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata (50% owned) in Atlantic City,
    New Jersey;

Grand Victoria (50% owned) in Elgin, Illinois; and MGM Grand
    Macau (50% owned).

Other operations include the Shadow Creek golf course in North
    Las Vegas and Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi. We
    also own the Primm Valley Golf Club at the California state
    line, which is currently operated by a third party. In December
    2008, we entered into an agreement to sell TI; the sale closed
    in March 2009.

CityCenter.

The other 50% of CityCenter is
    owned by Infinity World Development Corp (“Infinity
    World”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai,
    United Arab Emirates government decree entity. CityCenter
    consists of Aria, a 4,000-room casino resort; Mandarin Oriental
    Las Vegas, a 400-room non-gaming boutique hotel; Crystals, a
    425,000 square foot retail district, including shops,
    dining and entertainment venues; and Vdara, a 1,495-room luxury
    condominium-hotel. In addition, CityCenter features residential
    units in the Residences at Mandarin Oriental —
    225 units, and Veer — approximately
    670 units. Aria opened on December 16, 2009 and Vdara,
    Mandarin Oriental and Crystals all opened in early December
    2009. The residential units within CityCenter began the sales
    closing process in early 2010. Additionally, CityCenter
    postponed the opening of The Harmon Hotel & Spa, a
    400-room non-gaming boutique hotel, until such time as we and
    Infinity World mutually agree to proceed with its completion. We
    receive a management fee of 2% of gross revenues for the
    management of Aria and Vdara, and 5% of EBITDA, as defined. In
    addition, we receive an annual fee of $3 million for the
    management of Crystals.

Borgata.

In May 2009, the New Jersey Division
    of Gaming Enforcement (the “DGE”) issued a report
    which recommended to the New Jersey Casino Control Commission
    (the “New Jersey Commission) that, among other things, our
    Macau joint venture partner be found to be unsuitable and we be
    directed to disengage from any business association with such
    Macau joint venture partner. We are currently involved in
    constructive settlement discussions



with the DGE, which have centered on us placing our 50%
    ownership interest in the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa
    and related leased land in Atlantic City into a divestiture
    trust (the “Trust”) for which we would be the sole
    economic beneficiary. Any settlement is subject to both DGE and
    New Jersey Commission approval.

In February 2010, we entered into an amendment to our joint
    venture agreement with Boyd Gaming Corporation
    (“Boyd”) to permit the transfer of our 50% ownership
    interest into the Trust in connection with our potential
    settlement agreement with the DGE. The amendment also includes
    the following provisions that would become effective only upon
    the transfer of the joint venture interests into Trust: Boyd
    would receive a priority partnership distribution of
    approximately $31 million (equal to the excess prior
    capital contributions by Boyd) upon successful refinancing of
    the Borgata credit facility; in addition, Boyd would receive a
    payment from the Trust equal to the greater of $10 million
    or 3% of the proceeds from the sale of our 50% interest in
    Borgata.

If we reach a settlement agreement with the DGE, we will
    discontinue the equity method of accounting for Borgata at the
    point the assets are placed in the Trust and will account for
    our rights under the trust arrangement under the cost method of
    accounting. Earnings and losses that relate to the investment
    that were previously accrued will remain as a part of the
    carrying amount of the investment. Distributions received by the
    Trust in subsequent periods that do not exceed our share of
    earnings will be recognized currently in earnings. However,
    distributions to the Trust in subsequent periods that exceed our
    share of earnings for such periods will be applied to reduce the
    carrying amount of our investment.

Key
    Performance Indicators

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino
    resorts, which includes offering gaming, hotel, dining,
    entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. Over half of
    our net revenue is derived from non-gaming activities, a higher
    percentage than many of our competitors, as our operating
    philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our
    guests, including non-gaming amenities for which our guests are
    willing to pay a premium. Our significant convention and meeting
    facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer
    volumes during off-peak times such as mid-week or during
    traditionally slower leisure travel periods, which also leads to
    better labor utilization. We believe that we own several of the
    premier casino resorts in the world and have continually
    reinvested in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage.

As a resort-based company, our operating results are highly
    dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in
    turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and
    other amenities. We also generate a significant portion of our
    operating income from the high-end gaming segment, which can be
    a cause for variability in our results. Key performance
    indicators related to revenue are:

•

Gaming revenue indicators — table games drop and slots
    handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold”
    percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal
    table games win percentage is in the range of 18% to 22% of
    table games drop and our normal slots win percentage is in the
    range of 7% to 8% of slots handle;

•

Hotel revenue indicators — hotel occupancy (a volume
    indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price
    indicator); revenue per available room (“REVPAR,” a
    summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy
    rate).

Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers
    wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash
    or credit cards. Our resorts, like many in the industry,
    generate significant operating cash flow. Our industry is
    capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our
    resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing,
    fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash
    for future development.

We generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income
    from our resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada, which exposes us to
    certain risks outside of our control, such as increased
    competition from new or expanded Las Vegas resorts, and from the
    expansion of gaming in California. We are also exposed to risks
    related to tourism and the general economy, including national
    and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other
    global events.



Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature,
    though a variety of factors may affect the results of any
    interim period, including the timing of major Las Vegas
    conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special
    events for our high-end customers, and the level of play during
    major holidays, including New Year and Chinese New Year. We
    market to different customer segments to manage our hotel
    occupancy, such as targeting large conventions to ensure
    mid-week occupancy. Our results do not depend on key individual
    customers, although our success in marketing to customer groups,
    such as convention customers, or the financial health of
    customer segments, such as business travelers or high-end gaming
    customers from a particular country or region, can affect our
    results.

Impact of
    Economic Conditions and Credit Markets on Our Results of
    Operations

The state of the U.S. economy has negatively affected our
    results of operations since 2008 and we expect to continue to be
    affected by certain aspects of the current economic
    conditions — high unemployment and weak housing
    market, for example — into 2010. The decrease in
    liquidity in the credit markets which began in late 2007 and
    accelerated in late 2008 also significantly affected our results
    of operations and financial condition.

Uncertain economic conditions continue to affect our
    customers’ spending levels. Travel and travel-related
    expenditures have been particularly affected as businesses and
    consumers have altered their spending patterns which has led to
    decreases in visitor volumes and customer spending. Businesses
    responded to the difficult economic conditions by reducing
    travel budgets. This factor, along with perceptions surrounding
    certain types of business travel, negatively affected convention
    attendance in Las Vegas in 2009. Convention and catering
    customers cancelled or postponed a significant number of events
    occurring during 2008, 2009, and early 2010. Other conditions
    currently or recently present in the economic environment which
    tend to negatively affect our operating results include:

•

Weaknesses in employment and increases in unemployment;

•

Weak consumer confidence;

•

Weak housing market and significant declines in housing prices
    and related home equity; and

•

Decreases in air capacity to Las Vegas.

Because of these economic conditions, we have increasingly
    focused on managing costs and continue to review all areas of
    operations for efficiencies. We continually manage staffing
    levels across all our resorts and have reduced our salaried
    management positions. As a result, the average number of
    full-time equivalents at our resorts for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 was 11% lower than 2008, which was 8%
    lower than 2007.

In addition, we did not pay discretionary bonuses for 2008 due
    to not meeting our internal profit targets; we suspended Company
    contributions to our 401(k) plan and our nonqualified deferred
    compensation plans in 2009; we rescinded cost of living
    increases for non-union employees in 2009; and we reached an
    agreement with our primary union to defer the 2009 contractual
    pay increase. We paid discretionary bonuses for 2009 in February
    2010 and we will provide general salary increases to certain
    salaried employees in 2010. However, company matching
    contributions to our 401(k) plan and our nonqualified deferred
    compensation plans will remain frozen until such time as we
    believe it is prudent to reinstate these benefits.

Our results of operations are also affected by decisions we made
    related to our capital allocation, our access to capital, and
    our cost of capital — all of which are affected by the
    uncertain state of the global economy and the continued
    instability in the capital markets. For example:

•

In connection with the amendments to our senior credit facility
    in 2008, 2009, and 2010, we will incur higher interest costs;

•

Senior notes issued in November 2008, May 2009 and September
    2009 carry significantly higher interest rates than the notes
    maturing in 2009 and 2010, which will also lead to higher
    interest costs; and

•

Several credit agencies downgraded our credit rating in 2008 and
    2009, which may affect our ability to access future capital and
    cause future borrowings to carry higher interest rates.



Impairment
    Charges

Atlantic City Renaissance Pointe Land.

We
    reviewed the carrying value of our Renaissance Pointe land
    holdings for impairment at December 31, 2009 as we do not
    intend to pursue development of our MGM Grand Atlantic City
    project for the foreseeable future. Our Renaissance Pointe land
    holdings include a

72-acre

development site and 10 acres of land subject to a
    long-term lease with the Borgata joint venture. The fair value
    of the development land was determined based on a market
    approach, and the fair value of land subject to the long-term
    lease with Borgata was determined using a discounted cash flow
    analysis using expected contractual cash flows under the lease
    discounted at a market capitalization rate. As a result, we
    recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $548 million in
    the 2009 fourth quarter, which was included in “Property
    transactions, net” related to our land holdings on
    Renaissance Pointe and capitalized development costs.

CityCenter.

At September 30, 2009, we
    reviewed our CityCenter investment for impairment using revised
    operating forecasts developed by CityCenter management late in
    the third quarter of 2009. In addition, the impairment charge
    related to CityCenter’s residential real estate under
    development discussed below further indicated that our
    investment may have experienced an

“other-than-temporary”

decline in value. Our discounted cash flow analysis for
    CityCenter included estimated future cash outflows for
    construction and maintenance expenditures and future cash
    inflows from operations, including residential sales. Based on
    our analysis, we determined that the carrying value of our
    investment exceeded its fair value and therefore an impairment
    was indicated. We intend to, and believe we will be able to,
    retain our investment in CityCenter; however, due to the extent
    of the shortfall and our assessment of the uncertainty of fully
    recovering our investment, we determined that the impairment was

“other-than-temporary”

and recorded an impairment charge of $956 million included
    in “Property transactions, net.”

In addition, included in “Income (loss) from unconsolidated
    affiliates” is our share of an impairment charge relating
    to CityCenter residential real estate under development
    (“REUD”). CityCenter was required to review its REUD
    for impairment at September 30, 2009, mainly due to
    CityCenter’s September 2009 decision to discount the prices
    of its residential inventory by 30%. This decision and related
    market conditions led to CityCenter management’s conclusion
    that the carrying value of the REUD is not recoverable based on
    estimates of undiscounted cash flows. As a result, CityCenter
    was required to compare the fair value of its REUD to its
    carrying value and record an impairment charge in the third
    quarter of 2009 for the shortfall. Fair value of the REUD was
    determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based on
    management’s current expectations of future cash flows. The
    key inputs in the discounted cash flow analysis included
    estimated sales prices of units currently under contract and new
    unit sales, the absorption rate over the sell-out period, and
    the discount rate. This analysis resulted in an impairment
    charge of approximately $348 million of the REUD. We
    recognized 50% of such impairment charge, adjusted by certain
    basis differences, resulting in a pre-tax charge of
    $203 million. Once the residential inventory is complete,
    in the first quarter of 2010, CityCenter will be required to
    measure such inventory at the lower of a) its carrying
    value, or b) fair value less costs to sell. It is
    reasonably possible that the fair value less cost to sell of the
    residential inventory at completion will be below the
    inventory’s carrying value, and that the joint venture will
    be required to record an additional impairment charge at that
    time. We would record 50% of any such impairment charge,
    adjusted for certain basis differences.

M Resort Note.

At June 30, 2009, we
    reviewed our M Resort Note for impairment. Based on our review
    of the operating results of M Resort, as well as the M
    Resort’s management’s revised cash flow projections
    post-opening, which were significantly lower than original
    predictions due to market and general economic conditions, we
    determined that the fair value of the M Resort Note was $0, that
    the decline in value was

“other-than-temporary,”

and that the entire amount of the indicated impairment related
    to a credit loss. Based on these conclusions, we recorded a
    pre-tax impairment of $176 million in the second quarter of
    2009 within “Other non-operating expense.”



2008 Goodwill Impairment.

We perform our
    annual impairment test related to goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets during the fourth quarter of each year. No
    impairment charges were recorded as a result of our 2009
    analysis. As a result of our 2008 analysis, we recognized a
    non-cash impairment charge of $1.2 billion. The impairment
    charge related solely to the goodwill and other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets recognized in the 2005 acquisition of Mandalay
    Resort Group, and represented substantially all of the goodwill
    recognized at the time of the Mandalay acquisition and a minor
    portion of the value of trade names related to the Mandalay
    resorts. The impairment charge resulted from factors affected by
    economic conditions at the time, including: 1) lower market
    valuation multiples for gaming assets; 2) higher discount
    rates resulting from turmoil in the credit and equity markets;
    and 3) cash flow forecasts for the Mandalay resorts.

Hurricane
    Katrina and the Monte Carlo Fire

We maintain insurance for both property damage and business
    interruption relating to catastrophic events, such as Hurricane
    Katrina affecting Beau Rivage in August 2005 and the rooftop
    fire at Monte Carlo in January 2008. Business interruption
    coverage covers lost profits and other costs incurred during the
    closure period and up to six months following re-opening.

Hurricane Katrina.

We reached final settlement
    agreements with our insurance carriers related to Hurricane
    Katrina in late 2007. In total, we received insurance recoveries
    of $635 million, which exceeded the $265 million net
    book value of damaged assets and post-storm costs incurred. We
    recognized the $370 million of excess insurance recoveries
    in income in 2007 and 2006. In 2007, $67 million and
    $217 million of such excess insurance recoveries were
    recognized as offsets to “General and administrative”
    expense and “Property transactions, net,” respectively.

Monte Carlo fire.

We reached final settlement
    agreements for the Monte Carlo Fire in early 2009. In total, we
    received $74 million of proceeds from our insurance
    carriers. We recognized the $41 million of excess insurance
    recoveries in income in 2009 and 2008, with recoveries
    offsetting a write-down of $4 million related to the net
    book value of damaged assets, demolition costs of
    $7 million, and operating costs of $21 million. In
    2009, $15 million and $7 million of such excess
    insurance recoveries were recognized as offsets to “General
    and administrative” expense and “Property
    transactions, net,” respectively. In 2008, $9 million
    and $10 million of such excess insurance recoveries were
    recognized as offsets to “General and administrative”
    expense and “Property transactions, net,” respectively.

Net revenues decreased in 2009 and 2008 largely due to the
    economic factors discussed in “Impact of Economic
    Conditions and Credit Markets on Our Results of
    Operations.” As discussed further in “Operating
    Results — Detailed Revenue Information” revenues
    have decreased across all business lines. We reduced
    departmental operating expenses to maximize operating results by
    implementing cost savings efforts, but due to our leveraged
    business model a significant portion of the decline in revenue
    affected operating results and earnings.

Corporate expense increased in 2009 as a result of higher legal
    and advisory costs associated with our activities to improve our
    financial position as well as the accrual of bonus expense in
    2009. Corporate expense in 2008 declined from 2007 as a result
    of cost reduction efforts throughout the year and no bonus
    accrual due to not meeting internal profit targets. In addition,
    corporate expenses in 2007 included costs associated with the
    CityCenter joint venture transaction.

Depreciation and amortization expense decreased in 2009 due to
    certain assets becoming fully depreciated and the sale of TI. In
    2008, depreciation increased 11% due to the significant capital
    investments in our resorts in the previous few years. In
    addition, other transactions, events, and impairment charges had
    a significant impact on our earnings performance, certain of
    which we discussed in the “Executive Overview”
    section. As a result, operating loss was $964 million and
    $130 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Operating
    Results — Adjusted EBITDA

“Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest and
    other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and
    amortization, preopening and

start-up

expenses, and property transactions, net. “Adjusted
    Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDA before corporate
    expense and stock compensation expense and in 2007 the gain on
    our CityCenter transaction. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted
    Property EBITDA information is presented solely as a
    supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we
    believe that these measures are 1) widely used measures of
    operating performance in the gaming industry, and 2) a
    principal basis for valuation of gaming companies.



We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and
    Adjusted Property EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should
    not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it
    is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results
    and trends compared to other periods because these items can
    vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions
    or events that may not be comparable between the periods being
    presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate
    specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of
    future results. For example, preopening and

start-up

expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are
    developing and constructing a major expansion project and
    dependent on where the current period lies within the
    development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the
    project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring
    disposals and gains and losses on sales of assets related to
    specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or
    losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of
    resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or
    investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be
    comparable period over period.

In addition, capital allocation, tax planning, financing and
    stock compensation awards are all managed at the corporate
    level. Therefore, we use Adjusted Property EBITDA as the primary
    measure of our operating resorts’ performance.

Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be
    construed as an alternative to operating income or net income,
    as an indicator of our performance; or as an alternative to cash
    flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or
    as any other measure determined in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles. We have significant uses of cash
    flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes
    and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in
    Adjusted EBITDA. Also, other companies in the gaming and
    hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDA information
    may calculate Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner.

On a same store basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 38% in 2009 and
    23% in 2008. Excluding the $203 million impact from the
    residential impairment charge recorded by CityCenter, the
    $12 million impairment charge related to our postponed
    joint venture project on the North Las Vegas Strip, and Monte
    Carlo insurance recoveries, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 27% in
    2009.

On a same store basis, Adjusted Property EBITDA decreased 34% in
    2009 and 24% in 2008. Excluding the charges noted above,
    Adjusted Property EBITDA decreased 23% in 2009 with a margin of
    25% versus 28% in 2008. These decreases were largely due to the
    factors discussed in “Summary Financial Results” and
    “Impact of Economic Conditions and Credit Markets on Our
    Results of Operations.” Our regional resorts were affected
    to a lesser extent than our Las Vegas Strip resorts —
    Adjusted Property EBITDA at Gold Strike Tunica increased 43% in
    2009 on top of a 19% increase in 2008. Adjusted Property EBITDA
    at MGM Grand Detroit was flat in 2009 and 2008.

Table games revenue decreased 11%, or 9% on a same store basis,
    due to a decrease in overall table games volume, despite an
    increase of 33% for baccarat volume. The table games hold
    percentage was near the mid-point of our normal range for all
    years presented.

Slots revenue decreased 12% in 2009, or 9% on a same store
    basis, driven by a decrease in volume at our Las Vegas Strip
    resorts. Most of our Las Vegas Strip resorts experienced
    decreases in the high single digits, while MGM Grand Detroit and
    Gold Strike Tunica experienced decreases in the low single
    digits. In 2008, slots revenue at Bellagio and Mandalay Bay
    decreased 4% while the majority of our other Las Vegas Strip
    resorts experienced

year-over-year

decreases in the low double digits. Slots revenue increased 7%
    at MGM Grand Detroit and 5% at Gold Strike Tunica in 2008.

Room revenue decreased 28%, or 24% on a same store basis, in
    2009 and 10% in 2008 as a result of a decrease in occupancy and
    lower average room rates. The following table shows key hotel

Food and beverage, entertainment, and retail revenues in 2009
    and 2008 were negatively affected by lower customer spending and
    decreased occupancy at our resorts. In 2009, entertainment
    revenues benefited from the addition of

Terry Fator

at
    The Mirage. In 2008, entertainment revenues benefited from the
    addition of

Believe

at Luxor. Other revenues in 2009 and
    2008 included reimbursed costs from CityCenter, which were
    recognized as other revenue with corresponding amounts
    recognized as other expense. Reimbursed costs for CityCenter
    were $95 million in 2009 and $46 million in 2008.

    on the sale of an aircraft of $25 million. Insurance
    recoveries in 2009 and 2008 relate to the Monte Carlo fire and
    Hurricane Katrina in 2007.

Write-downs and impairments in 2007 included write-offs related
    to discontinued construction projects and a write-off of the
    carrying value of the Nevada Landing building assets due to its
    closure in March 2007. The 2007 period also includes demolition
    costs primarily related to the Mandalay Bay room remodel.



Operating
    Results — Income (Loss) from Unconsolidated
    Affiliates

We recognized a loss from unconsolidated affiliates of
    $88 million in 2009. These results include
    $203 million impact from the impairment charge recorded by
    CityCenter related to its residential real estate under
    development and a $12 million charge related to development
    costs for our postponed joint venture project on the North Las
    Vegas Strip. Income from unconsolidated affiliates in 2009
    benefited from increased operating results at MGM Grand Macau,
    which earned operating income of $60 million, an increase
    of 74% over 2008, and $14 million related to insurance
    proceeds recognized at the Borgata. Income from unconsolidated
    affiliates in 2007 included $93 million related to the sale
    of condominium units at The Signature at MGM Grand.

In 2009, gross interest costs increased compared to 2008 mainly
    due to higher average debt balances during 2009, higher interest
    rates for borrowings under our senior credit facility in 2009,
    higher interest rates for newly issued fixed rate borrowings, as
    well as breakage fees for voluntary repayments of our revolving
    credit facility. In 2008, gross interest costs decreased
    compared to 2007 mainly due to lower interest rates on our
    variable rate borrowings.

Capitalized interest increased in 2009 due to higher CityCenter
    investment balances and higher weighted average cost of debt.
    Capitalized interest decreased in 2008 compared to 2007 due to
    less capitalized interest on CityCenter and cessation of
    capitalized interest related to our investment in MGM Grand
    Macau upon opening in December 2007. The amounts presented above
    exclude non-cash gross interest and corresponding capitalized
    interest related to our CityCenter delayed equity contribution.

The income tax benefit provided on pre-tax loss in 2009 was
    greater than the Federal statutory rate of 35% primarily as a
    result of state tax benefit on the write-down of land in
    Atlantic City. The write-down of goodwill in 2008, which is
    treated as a permanently non-deductible item in our federal
    income tax provision, caused us to incur a provision for income
    tax expense even though our pre-tax result was a loss for the
    year. Excluding the effect of the goodwill write-down, the
    effective tax rate from continuing operations for 2008 was
    37.3%. This is higher than the 2007 rate due to the effect of
    the CityCenter transaction on the 2007 rate, which greatly
    minimized the effect of permanent and other tax items, and due
    to the deduction taken in 2007 for domestic production
    activities resulting primarily from the CityCenter transaction.



We received a net refund of cash taxes in 2009 due to income tax
    net operating losses incurred in 2009 and refunds of taxes that
    were paid in 2008. Cash taxes were paid in 2008 despite the
    pre-tax operating loss due to the non-deductible goodwill
    write-down and cash taxes paid on the CityCenter gain in 2008.
    Since the CityCenter gain was realized in the fourth quarter of
    2007, the associated income taxes were paid in 2008. Excluding
    the cash taxes paid on the CityCenter gain, cash taxes were
    approximately $250 million less in 2008 than in 2007.

Cash
    Flows — Operating Activities

Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our
    operating income, excluding gains and losses from investing
    activities and net property transactions, since our business is
    primarily cash-based. Cash flow from operations decreased 22% in
    2009 due to a decrease in operating income and the sale of TI.
    Operating cash flows also decreased due to a $47 million
    increase in our receivable from CityCenter, partially offset by
    increased distributions from unconsolidated affiliates.

Cash flow from operations decreased 24% in 2008 partially due to
    a decrease in operating income. The 2008 period also included a
    significant tax payment, approximately $300 million,
    relating to the 2007 CityCenter transaction. In addition, cash
    flow from operations in 2007 included $211 million of net
    cash outflows related to real estate under development
    expenditures partially offset by residential sales deposits when
    CityCenter was wholly owned, and $93 million related to the
    sale of condominium units at The Signature.



At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we held cash and cash
    equivalents of $2.1 billion and $296 million,
    respectively. On December 30, 2009, we borrowed the
    remaining availability of $1.6 billion under our senior
    credit facility and repaid such borrowings immediately after
    year end.

We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our
    resorts. Beyond our cash on hand, we utilize a company-wide cash
    management system to minimize the amount of cash held in banks.
    Funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into central
    bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are
    used to repay borrowings under our bank credit facilities.

Cash
    Flows — Investing Activities

A significant portion of our investing activities over the past
    three years related to our CityCenter joint venture. In 2009, we
    made equity contributions of $731 million to CityCenter. In
    2008, we made loans and equity contributions totaling
    $1.15 billion. In 2007, we invested $962 million in
    capital expenditures excluding capitalized interest, prior to
    contributing assets to the joint venture in November 2007 and
    receiving $2.5 billion in proceeds.

We received $746 million in net proceeds related to the
    sale of TI in 2009. The insurance recoveries classified as
    investing cash flows relate to the Monte Carlo fire in 2009 and
    2008 and Hurricane Katrina in 2007. Also in 2007, we received
    net proceeds of $597 million from the sale of the Primm
    Valley Resorts and the Laughlin Properties.

Capital expenditures of $137 million in 2009 consisted
    primarily of room remodel projects and various property
    enhancements, including capitalized interest.

In 2008, capital expenditures of $782 million related to
    the following, including related capitalized interest:

•

$64 million for CityCenter people mover and related assets;

•

$19 million related to construction costs for MGM Grand
    Detroit;

•

$61 million of development costs related to MGM Grand
    Atlantic City;

•

$230 million related to room remodel projects; and

•

$408 million for various other property enhancements and
    amenities.

In 2007, capital expenditures of $2.9 billion related to
    the following, including related capitalized interest;

•

$1.1 billion for CityCenter prior to contributing assets to
    joint venture;

•

$359 million related to construction costs for MGM Grand
    Detroit;

•

$63 million of construction costs related to rebuilding
    Beau Rivage;

•

$584 million related to purchase of land on Las Vegas Strip;

•

$102 million related to corporate aircraft;

•

$205 million related to room remodel projects; and

•

$474 million for various other property enhancements and
    amenities.

Cash
    Flows — Financing Activities

Excluding the $1.6 billion borrowed under the senior credit
    facility in late December and repaid immediately after year end,
    we repaid net debt of $1.1 billion in 2009. In addition,
    pursuant to our development agreement, we repaid
    $50 million of bonds issued by the Economic Development
    Corporation of the City of Detroit. In May 2009, we issued
    approximately 164.5 million shares of our common stock at
    $7 per share, for total net proceeds to us of $1.2 billion.

We issued the following senior notes during 2009:

•

$650 million of 10.375% senior secured notes due 2014;

•

$850 million of 11.125% senior secured notes due
    2017; and



•

$475 million of 11.375% senior notes due 2018.

We repaid the following principal amounts of senior and senior
    subordinated notes during 2009:

•

$226.3 million 6.5% senior notes (redeemed
    $122.3 million prior to maturity essentially at par);

•

$820 million 6% senior notes (redeemed
    $762.6 million prior to maturity essentially at par and the
    remaining $57.4 million was repaid at maturity); and

•

$100 million 7.25% senior debentures (redeemed prior
    to maturity for $127 million).

In 2008, we borrowed net debt of $2.4 billion including
    $2.5 billion under our senior credit facility. Also in
    2008, we issued $750 million of 13% senior secured
    notes due 2013.

We repaid the following senior and senior subordinated notes at
    maturity during 2008:

•

$180.4 million of 6.75% senior notes; and

•

$196.2 million of 9.5% senior notes.

Also in 2008, we repurchased $345 million of principal
    amounts of various series of our outstanding senior notes at a
    purchase price of $263 million in open market repurchases
    as part of a repurchase program authorized by our Board of
    Directors. We also redeemed at par $149.4 million of the
    principal amount of our 7% debentures due 2036 pursuant to
    a one-time put option by the holders of such debentures.

In 2007, we repaid net debt of $1.8 billion including
    $1.2 billion under our senior credit facility. In 2007, we
    issued $750 million of 7.5% senior notes maturing in
    2016 and we repaid the following senior and senior subordinated
    notes at their scheduled maturity: $710 million of
    9.75% senior subordinated notes; $200 million of
    6.75% senior notes; and $492.2 million of
    10.25% senior subordinated notes.

In 2007, we received approximately $1.2 billion from the
    sale of 14.2 million shares of our common stock to Infinity
    World Investments at a price of $84 per share.

Our share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase
    programs approved by our Board of Directors and publicly
    announced. In May 2008, our Board of Directors approved a
    20 million share authorization which was still fully
    available at December 31, 2009. We did not repurchase any
    shares of common stock during 2009. In 2008, we repurchased
    18.1 million shares at an average price of $68.36. In 2007,
    we repurchased 9.9 million shares at an average price of
    $83.92.

Principal
    Debt Arrangements

Our long-term debt consists of publicly held senior, senior
    secured, and senior subordinated notes and our senior credit
    facility. We pay fixed rates of interest ranging from 5.875% to
    13% on the senior, senior secured, and subordinated notes. At
    December 31, 2009, our senior credit facility had a
    capacity of $5.5 billion consisting of a term loan facility
    of $2.1 billion and a revolving credit facility of
    $3.4 billion and interest was based on LIBOR margin of
    4.00%, with a LIBOR floor of 2.00%, and a base margin at 3.00%,
    with a base rate floor of 4.00%. In late December 2009 we
    borrowed the remaining availability under the senior credit
    facility of $1.6 billion in order to increase our capacity
    for issuing additional senior secured notes under our existing
    public notes indentures and immediately repaid such amounts
    after year-end. Our senior credit facility contains certain
    financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants
    include 1) a quarterly minimum EBITDA test, based on a
    rolling

12-month

EBITDA; and 2) a covenant limiting annual capital
    expenditures. As discussed in “Executive Overview” we
    entered into an amendment to our senior credit facility on
    February 25, 2010.

All of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of
    our material subsidiaries, other than MGM Grand Detroit, LLC,
    our foreign subsidiaries, and our insurance subsidiaries. MGM
    Grand Detroit is a guarantor under the senior credit facility,
    but only to the extent that MGM Grand Detroit, LLC borrows under
    such facility. At December 31, 2009, the outstanding amount
    of borrowings related to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC was
    $450 million. In connection with our May 2009 senior credit
    facility amendment, MGM Grand Detroit granted lenders a security
    interest in its assets to secure its obligations under the
    senior credit facility.



Also in connection with our May 2009 senior credit facility
    amendment, we granted a security interest in Gold Strike Tunica
    and certain undeveloped land on the Las Vegas Strip to secure up
    to $300 million of obligations under the senior credit
    facility. In addition, substantially all of the assets of New
    York-New York serve as collateral for the 13% senior
    secured notes issued in 2008 and substantially all of the assets
    of Bellagio and The Mirage serve as collateral for the 10.375%
    and 11.125% senior secured notes issued in 2009. Upon the
    issuance of the 10.375% and 11.125% senior secured notes,
    the holders of our 13% senior secured notes due 2013
    obtained an equal and ratable lien in all collateral securing
    these notes. Otherwise, none of our assets serve as collateral
    for our principal debt arrangements.

Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity

Long-term debt payable in 2010.

We repaid
    $297 million of principal of senior notes due in February
    2010 and have $782 million of principal of senior notes due
    in September 2010.

Borgata settlement discussions.

As discussed
    in “Executive Overview,” we are involved in
    constructive settlement discussions with the DGE for an
    agreement under which we will sell our 50% ownership interest in
    Borgata and related leased land in Atlantic City. Prior to the
    consummation of the sale, the Trust will retain any cash flows
    received in respect of the assets in trust, but will pay
    property taxes and other costs attributable to the trust
    property. We have received significant distributions from
    Borgata in the past few years, and not receiving such
    distributions until the ultimate sale could negatively affect
    our liquidity in future periods.

Off
    Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments in unconsolidated affiliates.

Our
    off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments
    in unconsolidated affiliates, which currently consist primarily
    of our investments in CityCenter, Borgata, Grand Victoria,
    Silver Legacy, and MGM Grand Macau. We have not entered into any
    transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged
    in any derivative transactions. Our unconsolidated affiliate
    investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of
    owning a full-scale resort in a manner that minimizes our
    initial investment. We have not historically guaranteed
    financing obtained by our investees, and there are no other
    provisions of the venture agreements which we believe are
    unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be
    subjected if we had full ownership of the resort.

CityCenter completion guarantee.

In April
    2009, we entered into a new completion guarantee in conjunction
    with the CityCenter credit facility which amended the original
    completion guarantees to a) relieve Dubai World of its
    completion guarantee as amounts are funded from its letter of
    credit, and b) require an unlimited completion and cost
    overrun guarantee from us, secured by our interests in the
    assets of Circus Circus Las Vegas and certain adjacent
    undeveloped land. Also affecting the potential exposure under
    the completion guarantee is the ability to utilize up to
    $244 million of net residential proceeds to fund
    construction costs, though the timing of receipt of such
    proceeds is uncertain. As of December 31, 2009, we recorded
    a net liability of $150 million, classified as “Other
    accrued liabilities”, which represents the low end of our
    estimated range for our net obligation under the completion
    guarantee. We believe that it is reasonably possible we will be
    required to fund a net obligation of up to $300 million. In
    January and February 2010 we funded $217 million under the
    completion guarantee. CityCenter will repay such amounts to us
    from proceeds of residential units.

Letters of credit.

At December 31, 2009,
    we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $37 million.
    Though not subject to a letter of credit, we have an agreement
    with the Nevada Gaming Control Board to maintain
    $113 million of cash at the corporate level to support
    normal bankroll requirements at our Nevada operations.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of
    operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our
    consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
    the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate
    these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we
    consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in
    the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on
    our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
    Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about
    our critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed the
    processes to determine those estimates.



Allowance
    for Doubtful Casino Accounts Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games
    volume at Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and The
    Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the
    same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those
    casinos as well. We maintain strict controls over the issuance
    of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those
    customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These
    collection efforts are similar to those used by most large
    corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts,
    including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices,
    personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and
    civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable
    instruments in the United States. At December 31, 2009 and
    2008, approximately 40% and 52%, respectively, of our casino
    accounts receivable was owed by customers from the United
    States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some
    foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign
    customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the
    United States. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, approximately
    46% and 34%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable was
    owed by customers from the Far East.

We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino
    accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision
    for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the
    allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the
    allowance for doubtful casino accounts. At resorts where marker
    play is not significant, the allowance is generally established
    by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account
    balances. At resorts where marker play is significant, we apply
    standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a
    specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the
    collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified
    dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the
    customer’s financial condition, collection history and any
    other known information. We also monitor regional and global
    economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels
    are adequate.

The collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of
    factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and
    economic conditions in the customers’ home countries.
    Because individual customer account balances can be significant,
    the allowance and the provision can change significantly between
    periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known
    or as changes in a region’s economy occur.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino
    receivables:

The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino
    accounts receivable has decreased in the current year due to a
    larger percentage of current receivables, although percentage of
    accounts over 180 days has increased slightly from prior
    year. At December 31, 2009, a 100 basis-point change in the
    allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino
    accounts receivable would change net income by $2 million,
    or less than $0.01 per share.

Fixed
    Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies

Property and equipment are stated at cost. For the majority of
    our property and equipment, cost has been determined based on
    estimated fair values in connection with the April 2005 Mandalay
    acquisition and the May 2000 Mirage Resorts acquisition.
    Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value
    of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to
    expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided
    on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of
    the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors,
    property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction
    subsidiaries. In addition, interest cost associated with major
    development and construction projects is capitalized as part of
    the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on
    amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost
    of our outstanding borrowings, since we typically do not borrow
    funds directly related to a development project. Capitalization
    of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases
    when construction is substantially complete or development
    activity is suspended for more than a brief period.



We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for
    capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a
    maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment.
    When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine
    whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise
    impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. Our
    depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we
    make about our assets’ estimated useful lives. We determine
    the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar
    assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of
    the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change
    the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change
    prospectively.

Impairment
    of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible
    Assets

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived
    assets for impairment based on our classification as
    a) held for sale or b) to be held and used. Several
    criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for
    sale, including that management with the appropriate authority
    commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in
    relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For
    assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at
    the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of
    disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers
    received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held
    and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of
    impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash
    flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying
    value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the
    carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted
    cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment
    is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically
    measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is
    still under development, future cash flows include remaining
    construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether
    for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used,
    are recorded as operating expenses.

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in
    measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management
    must determine the usage of the asset. To the extent management
    decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an
    impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the
    lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means
    that some assets must be grouped, and management has some
    discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates
    are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ
    materially from our estimates.

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to
    determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that
    indicate a potential impairment. We estimate future cash flows
    using our internal budgets. When appropriate, we discount future
    cash flows using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed
    using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline
    companies in our industry.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair
    market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. We
    review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least
    annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances.
    We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each
    fiscal year. Goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for
    impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our
    budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost
    of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing
    model based on guideline companies in our industry, and market
    indicators of terminal year capitalization rates.
    Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license
    rights, which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash
    flow approach, and trademarks, which are tested for impairment
    using the relief-from-royalty method.

There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets
    for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are,
    by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ
    materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of
    capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the goodwill
    impairment test are highly judgmental and dependent in large
    part on expectations of future market conditions.

See “Executive Overview” and “Results of
    Operations” for discussion of write-downs and impairments
    of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets recorded in
    2009, 2008 and 2007. Other than mentioned therein, we are not
    aware of events or circumstances through December 31, 2009
    that would cause us to review any material long-lived assets,
    goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.



Impairment
    of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced
    an

“other-than-temporary”

decline in value. If these conditions exist, we compare the
    estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to
    determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine
    whether the impairment is

“other-than-temporary”

based on our assessment of relevant factors, including
    consideration of our intent and ability to retain our
    investment. We estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow
    analysis utilizing estimates of future cash flows and market
    indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization
    rates. See “Executive Overview” for discussion of
    impairment charges recorded in 2009 related to our investment in
    CityCenter.

Income
    Taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves,
    related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain
    temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent
    that realization of such benefit is more likely than not.
    Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. Except for certain
    New Jersey state net operating losses, certain other New Jersey
    state deferred tax assets and a foreign tax credit carryforward,
    we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax
    assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of
    existing taxable temporary differences and future projected
    taxable income.

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax
    authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes
    subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be
    accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities.

We assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax
    position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than
    not” threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of
    benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
    realized. We review uncertain tax positions at each balance
    sheet date. Liabilities we record as a result of this analysis
    are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax
    accounts, and are classified as current (“Other accrued
    liabilities”) or long-term (“Other long-term
    liabilities”) based on the time until expected payment.
    Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties
    related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal
    jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign
    jurisdictions, although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions
    are not material. As of December 31, 2009, we were no
    longer subject to examination of our U.S. consolidated
    federal income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2003.
    In the fourth quarter of 2009, we reached settlement with the
    IRS in post-Appeals mediation with respect to issues related to
    a land sale transaction in 2002. We agreed to an additional tax
    liability of $2 million and associated interest for the
    2002 tax year as a result of this settlement. We paid most of
    this tax and associated interest in a prior year in order to
    minimize the amount of interest due. All matters concerning the
    IRS audit of the 2001 and 2002 federal income tax returns are
    now settled. The IRS is currently examining our federal income
    tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years. We anticipate this
    audit will close sometime in 2010 and we will likely protest
    many of the issues under audit. Federal income tax returns for
    years subsequent to 2004 are also subject to examination.

During 2009, the IRS completed its audit of the 2004 through
    2006 tax years of a subsidiary of ours treated as a partnership
    for income tax purposes and we submitted a protest to IRS
    Appeals with respect to issues relating to the tax treatment of
    payments made by the subsidiary under an agreement to develop,
    own and operate a hotel casino in the City of Detroit.

During 2009, the IRS completed its audit of an unconsolidated
    affiliate of ours for the 2003 and 2004 tax years and we and our
    joint venture partner submitted a protest to IRS Appeals of
    various issues raised by the IRS in the audit.

In the first quarter of 2010, the IRS informed us that it was
    closing its examination of the federal income tax return of
    Mandalay Resort Group for the pre-acquisition year ended
    April 25, 2005 and will issue a “No-Change
    Letter.” The statute of limitations for assessing tax for
    the Mandalay Resort Group federal income tax return for the year
    ended January 31, 2005 has been extended but such return is
    not currently under examination by the IRS.



As of December 31, 2009, we were no longer subject to
    examination of our various state and local tax returns filed for
    years ended prior to 2005. During 2009, the state of Illinois
    notified us that it would initiate an audit of our Illinois
    combined returns for the 2006 and 2007 tax years. We anticipate
    this audit will begin during 2010. A Mandalay Resort Group
    subsidiary return for the pre-acquisition year ended
    April 25, 2005 is under examination by the City of Detroit
    and the statute of limitations for assessing tax will expire in
    2010 unless extended. No other state or local income tax returns
    of ours are currently under exam.

Stock-based
    Compensation

We account for stock options and stock appreciation rights
    (“SARs”) measuring fair value using the Black-Scholes
    model. For restricted stock units, compensation expense is
    calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the
    date of grant. There are several management assumptions required
    to determine the inputs into the Black-Scholes model. Our
    volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly
    affect the fair value of stock options and SARs. The extent of
    the impact will depend, in part, on the extent of awards in any
    given year. In 2009, we granted 6.8 million SARs with a
    total fair value of $37 million. In 2008, we granted
    4.9 million SARs with a total fair value of
    $72 million. In 2007, we granted 2.6 million SARs with
    a total fair value of $68 million.

For 2009 awards, a 10% change in the volatility assumption (82%
    for 2009; for sensitivity analysis, volatility was assumed to be
    74% and 90%) would have resulted in a $2.5 million, or 7%,
    change in fair value. A 10% change in the expected term
    assumption (4.7 years for 2009; for sensitivity analysis,
    expected term was assumed to be 4.2 years and
    5.2 years) would have resulted in a $1.4 million, or
    4%, change in fair value. These changes in fair value would have
    been recognized over the five-year vesting period of such
    awards. It should be noted that a change in the expected term
    would cause other changes, since the risk-free rate and
    volatility assumptions are specific to the term; we did not
    attempt to adjust those assumptions in performing the
    sensitivity analysis above.

Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

We adopted various accounting standards during 2009, none of
    which had a material effect on our consolidated financial
    statements. In addition, certain amendments to Accounting
    Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810
    “Consolidation” become effective for us beginning
    January 1, 2010. Such amendments include changes to the
    quantitative approach to determine the primary beneficiary of a
    variable interest entity (“VIE”). An enterprise must
    determine if its variable interest or interests give it a
    controlling financial interest in a VIE by evaluating whether
    1) the enterprise has the power to direct activities of the
    VIE that have a significant effect on economic performance, and
    2) the enterprise has an obligation to absorb losses or the
    right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially
    be significant to the VIE. The amendments to ASC 810 also
    require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the
    primary beneficiary of a VIE. The adoption of these amendments
    did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial
    statements.



Market
    Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in
    market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is
    interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term
    debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by
    managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and
    short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change
    in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our
    future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments.
    As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is
    acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash
    flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect
    would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when
    the debt matures.

As of December 31, 2009, long-term variable rate borrowings
    represented approximately 39% of our total borrowings. Assuming
    a 100 basis-point increase in LIBOR over the 2% floor specified
    in our senior credit facility, our annual interest cost would
    change by approximately $55 million based on amounts
    outstanding at December 31, 2009. The following table
    provides additional information about our long-term debt subject
    to changes in interest rates:

MANAGEMENT’S
    ANNUAL REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management’s
    Responsibilities

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting for MGM
    MIRAGE and subsidiaries (the “Company”).

Objective
    of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In establishing adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, management has developed and maintained a system of
    internal control, policies and procedures designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that information contained in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements and other
    information presented in this annual report is reliable, does
    not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
    state a material fact, and fairly presents in all material
    respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented in this
    annual report. Significant elements of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting include, for example:

•

Hiring skilled accounting personnel and training them
    appropriately;

•

Written accounting policies;

•

Written documentation of accounting systems and procedures;

•

Segregation of incompatible duties;

•

Internal audit function to monitor the effectiveness of the
    system of internal control;

•

Oversight by an independent Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors.

Management’s
    Evaluation

Management has evaluated the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting using the criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on its evaluation as of December 31,
    2009, management believes that the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is effective in achieving the
    objectives described above.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Deloitte & Touche LLP audited the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 and issued their report thereon, which is
    included in this annual report. Deloitte & Touche LLP
    has also issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and
    such report is also included in this annual report.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM MIRAGE

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    MGM MIRAGE and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2009.
    Our report dated February 26, 2010 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
    schedule.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM MIRAGE

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    MGM MIRAGE and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included
    in Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and financial
    statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MGM
    MIRAGE and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2009, in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion,
    such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
    to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 26, 2010,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

MGM
    MIRAGE AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 —

ORGANIZATION

MGM MIRAGE (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation.
    As of December 31, 2009, approximately 37% of the
    outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock were owned
    by Tracinda Corporation, a Nevada corporation wholly owned by
    Kirk Kerkorian. Prior to the May 2009 issuance of common
    stock — see Note 14 —  Tracinda
    Corporation owned more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the
    Company’s common stock. As a result, Tracinda Corporation
    had the ability to elect the Company’s entire Board of
    Directors and to determine the outcome of other matters
    submitted to the Company’s stockholders, such as the
    approval of significant transactions. Following the May 2009
    issuance of common stock, Tracinda Corporation continues to have
    significant influence with respect to the election of directors
    and other matters, but it no longer has the power to solely
    determine these matters. MGM MIRAGE acts largely as a holding
    company and, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns

and/or

operates casino resorts.

The Company owns and operates the following casino resorts in
    Las Vegas, Nevada: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay,
    The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Excalibur, Monte Carlo,
    and Circus Circus Las Vegas. Operations at MGM Grand Las Vegas
    include management of The Signature at MGM Grand Las Vegas, a
    condominium-hotel consisting of three towers. Other Nevada
    operations include Circus Circus Reno, Gold Strike in Jean, and
    Railroad Pass in Henderson. The Company has a 50% investment in
    Silver Legacy in Reno, which is adjacent to Circus Circus Reno.
    The Company also owns Shadow Creek, an exclusive world-class
    golf course located approximately ten miles north of its Las
    Vegas Strip resorts, and Primm Valley Golf Club at the
    California/Nevada state line.

The Company also owns 50% of CityCenter, located on the Las
    Vegas Strip between Bellagio and Monte Carlo. The other 50% of
    CityCenter is owned by Infinity World Development Corp
    (“Infinity World”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dubai
    World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates government decree entity.
    CityCenter consists of Aria, a 4,000-room casino resort;
    Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas, a 400-room non-gaming boutique
    hotel; Crystals, a 425,000 square foot retail district,
    including shops, dining and entertainment venues; and Vdara, a
    1,495-room luxury condominium-hotel. In addition, CityCenter
    features residential units in the Residences at Mandarin
    Oriental — 225 units and Veer —
    approximately 670 units. Aria opened on December 16,
    2009 and Vdara, Mandarin Oriental and Crystals all opened in
    early December 2009. The residential units within CityCenter
    began the sales closing process in early 2010. Additionally,
    CityCenter postponed the opening of The Harmon Hotel &
    Spa, a 400-room non-gaming boutique hotel, until such time as
    the Company and Infinity World mutually agree to proceed with
    its completion. The Company entered into various management
    agreements with the joint venture for the ongoing operations of
    CityCenter. The Company receives a management fee of 2% of gross
    revenues for the management of Aria and Vdara, and 5% of EBITDA,
    as defined. In addition, the Company receives an annual fee of
    $3 million for the management of Crystals.

The Company and its local partners own and operate MGM Grand
    Detroit in Detroit, Michigan. The Company also owns and operates
    two resorts in Mississippi: Beau Rivage in Biloxi and Gold
    Strike Tunica.

The Company has 50% interests in three resorts outside of
    Nevada: MGM Grand Macau, Grand Victoria and Borgata. MGM Grand
    Macau is a casino resort that opened on December 18, 2007.
    Pansy Ho Chiu-King owns the other 50% of MGM Grand Macau. Grand
    Victoria is a riverboat in Elgin, Illinois. An affiliate of
    Hyatt Gaming owns the other 50% of Grand Victoria and also
    operates the resort. Borgata is a casino resort located on
    Renaissance Pointe in the Marina area of Atlantic City, New
    Jersey. Boyd Gaming Corporation (“Boyd”) owns the
    other 50% of Borgata and also operates the resort. See
    Note 8 for further discussion of Borgata.

The Company owns additional land adjacent to Borgata, a portion
    of which consists of common roads, landscaping and master plan
    improvements, and a portion of which was planned for a
    wholly-owned development, MGM Grand Atlantic City. As part of
    the potential settlement discussed in Note 8, the Company
    has agreed that an affiliate of the Company would withdraw its
    license application for this development. The Company does not
    intend



to pursue this development for the foreseeable
    future — see Note 3 for further discussion of the
    related impairment charge.

NOTE 2

—
    LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION

The Company has significant indebtedness and it has significant
    financial commitments in 2010. On December 30, 2009, the
    Company borrowed the $1.6 billion then available to it
    under its senior credit facility in order to increase its
    capacity for issuing additional senior secured notes under its
    existing public notes indentures; it repaid this borrowing on
    January 4, 2010. Therefore, as of December 31, 2009,
    the Company had a higher than normal cash balance of
    $2.1 billion. As of December 31, 2009, the Company had
    approximately $14.1 billion of total long-term debt
    including amounts outstanding under its senior credit facility.
    As discussed below, on February 25, 2010, the Company entered
    into an agreement amending its senior credit facility, which,
    among other things, provides for an extension of the maturity
    date for a portion of its senior credit facility (subject to the
    fulfillment of certain conditions), provided for a reduction in
    the credit exposures of lenders agreeing to such extensions, and
    an increase in applicable interest rates payable to such lenders.

As of December 31, 2009 the Company’s financial
    obligations in 2010 included $1.1 billion related to
    maturities of long-term debt; $1.0 billion in estimated
    interest payments on outstanding debt; and an estimated
    $394 million under its CityCenter completion guarantee
    which it expects to be partially offset by up to
    $244 million in proceeds from the sale of residential units
    at CityCenter, though the timing of receipt of such proceeds is
    uncertain. In addition, the Company expects to invest
    approximately $250 million in currently uncommitted capital
    expenditures at its resorts in 2010.

Giving effect to the January 4, 2010 repayment, the Company
    had approximately $1.6 billion available under its senior
    credit facility to fund its 2010 obligations as of
    December 31, 2009. The Company has no other existing
    sources of borrowing availability, except to the extent it
    reduces amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility. In
    addition, the Company historically has generated significant
    cash flows from operations; the Company generated approximately
    $1.4 billion in cash flows from operations before deducting
    cash paid for interest in 2009. The Company also expects to
    receive tax refunds of approximately $385 million during
    2010.

On February 25, 2010 the Company entered into an amendment (the
    “Amendment”) to its senior credit facility which:

•

Provides the Company a period through June 30, 2010 to
    raise sufficient capital to make the “Required
    Prepayments” described below;

•

Permits the Company to issue not more than $850 million of
    secured indebtedness to finance all or a portion of the Required
    Prepayments;

•

Permits the Company to transfer its 50% interest in Borgata and
    certain land and cash into a trust — see
    Note 8; and

•

Requires the payment of an amendment fee to all lenders under
    the credit facility.

Pursuant to the Amendment, a restatement of the senior credit
    facility (the “Restated Loan Agreement”) will become
    effective upon making of the Required Prepayments and
    satisfaction of certain documentary conditions provided that
    these occur no later than June 30, 2010.

The Restated Loan Agreement:

•

Requires the Company to make a 20% reduction in credit exposures
    of those of its lenders which have agreed to extend their
    commitments, other than lenders which waived such reduction (the
    “Required Prepayments” — approximately
    $820 million);

•

Subject to the making of the Required Prepayments and the
    fulfillment of certain other conditions, re-tranches the senior
    credit facility so that approximately $1.4 billion of
    revolving loans and commitments will



be effectively converted into term loans, leaving a revolving
    credit commitment of $2.0 billion, approximately
    $300 million of which will mature in October 2011;

•

Requires the Company to repay in full the approximately
    $1.2 billion owed to lenders which have not agreed to
    extend their commitments on the existing maturity date in
    October 2011;

•

Extends (subject to certain conditions) the maturity date for
    the remaining approximately $3.6 billion of the loans and
    lending commitments (adjusted for the Required Prepayments)
    under the credit facility through February 21, 2014;

•

Provides for extension fees and a 100 basis point increase
    in interest rate for extending lenders; and

•

Continues the existing minimum EBITDA and maximum annual capital
    expenditures covenants with periodic step-ups during the
    extension period.

In addition, the Restated Loan Agreement will allow the Company
    to issue unsecured debt and equity securities to refinance
    indebtedness maturing prior to October 3, 2011 and the
    $1.2 billion portion of the obligations owed to
    non-extending Lenders. Following the repayment of such lenders
    and the fulfillment of certain other conditions, the maturity of
    the balance of the senior credit facility will be extended to
    February 21, 2014 and the Restated Loan Agreement will
    thereafter permit the Company to issue unsecured debt and equity
    securities to refinance indebtedness which matures prior to the
    maturity date of the extended facilities. However,
    (a) indebtedness in amounts issued in excess of
    $250 million over such interim maturities requires ratable
    prepayment of the credit facilities in an amount equal to 50% of
    the net cash proceeds of such excess, and (b) equity
    amounts issued in excess of $500 million over such interim
    maturities require ratable prepayment of the credit facilities
    in an amount equal to 50% of the net cash proceeds of such
    excess.

NOTE 3 —

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Principles of consolidation.

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
    subsidiaries. The Company’s investments in unconsolidated
    affiliates which are 50% or less owned are accounted for under
    the equity method. The Company does not have a variable interest
    in any variable interest entities. All intercompany balances and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
    Company’s operations are primarily in one segment:
    operation of casino resorts. Other operations, and foreign
    operations, are not material.

Management’s use of estimates.

The
    consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Those principles require the
    Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Financial statement impact of Hurricane Katrina and Monte
    Carlo fire.

The Company maintains insurance for
    both property damage and business interruption relating to
    catastrophic events, such as Hurricane Katrina which damaged
    Beau Rivage in August 2005 and the rooftop fire at Monte Carlo
    in January 2008. Business interruption coverage covers lost
    profits and other costs incurred during the closure period and
    up to six months following re-opening.

Non-refundable insurance recoveries received in excess of the
    net book value of damaged assets,

clean-up

and
    demolition costs, and post-event costs are recognized as income
    in the period received or committed based on the Company’s
    estimate of the total claim for property damage (recorded as
    “Property transactions, net”) and business
    interruption (recorded as a reduction of “General and
    administrative” expenses) compared to the recoveries
    received at that time. All post-event costs and expected
    recoveries are recorded net within “General and
    administrative” expenses, except for depreciation of
    non-damaged assets, which is classified as “Depreciation
    and amortization.”

Insurance recoveries are classified in the statement of cash
    flows based on the coverage to which they relate. Recoveries
    related to business interruption are classified as operating
    cash flows and recoveries related to property damage are
    classified as investing cash flows. However, the Company’s
    insurance policy includes undifferentiated



coverage for both property damage and business interruption.
    Therefore, the Company classifies insurance recoveries as being
    related to property damage until the full amount of damaged
    assets and demolition costs are recovered, and classifies
    additional recoveries up to the amount of post-event costs
    incurred as being related to business interruption. Insurance
    recoveries beyond that amount are classified as operating or
    investing cash flows based on the Company’s estimated
    allocation of the total claim.

Hurricane Katrina.

The Company reached final
    settlement agreements with its insurance carriers related to
    Hurricane Katrina in late 2007. In total, the Company received
    insurance recoveries of $635 million, which exceeded the
    $265 million net book value of damaged assets and
    post-storm costs incurred. The Company recognized the
    $370 million of excess insurance recoveries in income in
    2007 and 2006.

Monte Carlo fire.

The Company reached final
    settlement agreements for the Monte Carlo Fire in early 2009. In
    total, the Company received $74 million of proceeds from
    its insurance carriers. The Company recognized the
    $41 million of excess insurance recoveries in income in
    2008 and 2009, with recoveries offsetting a write-down of
    $4 million related to the net book value of damaged assets,
    demolition costs of $7 million, and operating costs of
    $21 million.

Fair value measurements.

Fair value
    measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment
    assessments of its long-lived assets, goodwill, and other
    intangibles as discussed further in relevant sections below.
    Fair value measurements also affect the Company’s
    accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities.

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date
    and is measured according to a hierarchy



that includes: “Level 1” inputs, such as quoted
    prices in an active market; “Level 2” inputs,
    which are observable inputs for similar assets; or
    “Level 3” inputs, which are unobservable inputs.

The Company used fair value measurements in its accounting for
    investment in The M Resort LLC 6% convertible note maturing June
    2015 and embedded call option (the “M Resort Note”).
    The fair value of the convertible note was previously measured
    using “Level 2” inputs. As of June 30, 2009,
    the fair value of the convertible note and embedded call option
    were measured using “Level 3” inputs. See below
    under “Investment in The M Resort LLC convertible
    note” for further discussion of the valuation of the M
    Resort Note.

The Company uses fair value measurements when assessing
    impairment of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The
    Company estimates such fair value using a discounted cash flow
    analysis utilizing “Level 3” inputs, including market
    indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization
    rates — see Note 8 for further discussion.

At December 31, 2009, the fair value of the Company’s
    carrying value of its Renaissance Pointe land holdings were
    measured using “Level 2” and
    “Level 3” inputs. See below under “Property
    and Equipment” for further discussion of the Renaissance
    Pointe impairment.

During 2008, the Company used “Level 2” inputs to
    evaluate the fair value of its Primm Valley Golf Club
    “PVGC.” See below under “Property and
    Equipment” for further discussion of the PVGC impairment.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments
    with maturities of three months or less at the date of
    acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost, which
    approximates market value. Book overdraft balances resulting
    from the Company’s cash management program are recorded as
    accounts payable, construction payable, or other accrued
    liabilities, as applicable.

Accounts receivable and credit risk.

Financial
    instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of casino
    accounts receivable. The Company issues markers to approved
    casino customers following background checks and investigations
    of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2009, a substantial
    portion of the Company’s receivables were due from
    customers residing in foreign countries. Business or economic
    conditions or other significant events in these countries could
    affect the collectibility of such receivables.

Accounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are
    initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when
    management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of
    accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An
    estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to
    reduce the Company’s receivables to their net carrying
    amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is
    estimated based on specific review of customer accounts as well
    as historical collection experience and current economic and
    business conditions. Management believes that as of
    December 31, 2009, no significant concentrations of credit
    risk existed for which an allowance had not already been
    recorded.

Inventories.

Inventories consist of food and
    beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are
    stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
    primarily by the average cost method for food and beverage and
    supplies and the retail inventory or specific identification
    methods for retail merchandise.

Property and equipment.

Property and equipment
    are stated at cost. Gains or losses on dispositions of property
    and equipment are included in the determination of income.
    Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Property and
    equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated
    useful lives on a straight-line basis:

Buildings and improvements

30 to 45 years

Land improvements

10 to 20 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 10 years

Equipment

3 to 20 years

The Company evaluates its property and equipment and other
    long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as
    a) held for sale or b) to be held and used. Several
    criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for
    sale, including that management with the appropriate authority
    commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in
    relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For
    assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the
    lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell,
    as estimated based on



comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash
    flow model. For assets to be held and used, the Company reviews
    for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The
    Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the
    asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the
    asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value,
    no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do
    not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded
    based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a
    discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under
    development, future cash flows include remaining construction
    costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets held
    for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as
    operating expenses.

The Company reviewed the carrying value of its Renaissance
    Pointe land holdings for impairment at December 31, 2009 as
    management did not intend to pursue its MGM Grand Atlantic City
    project for the foreseeable future. The Company’s
    Renaissance Pointe land holdings include a

72-acre

development site and 10 acres of land subject to a
    long-term lease with the Borgata joint venture. The fair value
    of the development land was determined based on a market
    approach and the fair value of land subject to the long-term
    lease with Borgata was determined using a discounted cash flow
    analysis using expected contractual cash flows under the lease
    discounted at a market capitalization rate. As a result, the
    Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of
    $548 million in the 2009 fourth quarter which was included
    in “Property transactions, net” related to its land
    holdings on Renaissance Pointe and capitalized development costs.

During 2008, the Company concluded that the Primm Valley Golf
    Club (“PVGC”) should be reviewed for impairment due to
    its recent operating losses and the Company’s expectation
    that such operating losses will continue. The estimated future
    undiscounted cash flows of PVGC did not exceed its carrying
    value. The Company determined the estimated fair value of PVGC
    to be approximately $14 million based on the comparable
    sales approach. The carrying value of PVGC exceeds its estimated
    fair value and as a result, the Company recorded an impairment
    charge of $30 million which is included in “Property
    transactions, net” for the year ended December 31,
    2008.

Capitalized interest.

The interest cost
    associated with major development and construction projects is
    capitalized and included in the cost of the project. When no
    debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is
    capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the
    weighted-average cost of the Company’s outstanding
    borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project
    is substantially complete or development activity is suspended
    for more than a brief period.

Investment in The M Resort LLC convertible
    note.

In June 2007, the Company purchased a
    $160 million convertible note issued by The M Resort LLC,
    which developed and currently operates a casino resort on Las
    Vegas Boulevard, 10 miles south of Bellagio. The
    convertible note matures in June 2015, contains certain optional
    and mandatory redemption provisions, and is convertible into a
    50% equity interest in The M Resort LLC. The convertible note
    earns interest at 6% which may be paid in cash or accrued
    “in kind” for the first five years; thereafter
    interest must be paid in cash. There are no scheduled principal
    payments before maturity.

The convertible note was accounted for as a hybrid financial
    instrument consisting of a host debt instrument and an embedded
    call option on The M Resort LLC’s equity. The debt
    component was accounted for separately as an

available-for-sale

marketable security, with changes in value recorded in other
    comprehensive income. The call option was treated as a
    derivative with changes in value recorded in earnings. The
    initial value of the call option was $0 and the initial value of
    the debt was $155 million, with the discount accreted to
    earnings over the term of the note. The fair value of the call
    option was $0 at December 31, 2008 and 2007. At
    June 30, 2009, the Company determined that the fair value
    of the M Resort Note was $0, that the decline in value was

“other-than-temporary,”

and that the entire amount of the indicated impairment related
    to a credit loss. The conclusion that the decline in value was

“other-than-temporary”

was based on the Company’s assessment of actual results
    since the opening of the M Resort and M Resort’s
    management’s revised cash flow projections since its
    opening, which are significantly lower than original predictions
    due to market and general economic conditions. Based on the
    conclusions above, the Company recorded a pre-tax impairment
    charge of $176 million — the accreted value as of
    May 31, 2009 — in the second quarter of 2009
    within “Other non-operating expense.” Of that amount,
    $82 million was reclassified from accumulated other
    comprehensive loss, which amount was $54 million net of
    tax. The Company stopped recording accrued

“paid-in-kind”

interest as of May 31, 2009.



Investments in and advances to unconsolidated
    affiliates.

The Company has investments in
    unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method.
    Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the
    Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses,
    as well as capital contributions to and distributions from these
    companies.

The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated
    affiliates for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such
    investment may have experienced an

“other-than-temporary”

decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares
    the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value
    to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines
    whether such impairment is

“other-than-temporary”

based on its assessment of all relevant factors. Estimated fair
    value is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis based
    on estimated future results of the investee and market
    indicators of terminal year capitalization rates. See
    Note 8 for results of the Company’s review of its
    investment in certain of its unconsolidated affiliates.

Goodwill and other intangible assets.

Goodwill
    represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value
    of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for
    impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in
    certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual
    impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No
    impairments were indicated as a result of the annual impairment
    review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in
    2009 and 2007. See Note 9 for results of the Company’s
    2008 annual impairment tests.

Goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment
    using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated
    future results of the Company’s reporting units discounted
    using the Company’s weighted average cost of capital and
    market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates. The
    implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill is
    compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. The implied
    fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair
    value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and
    the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of
    goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than
    its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied
    fair value. License rights are tested for impairment using a
    discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks are tested for
    impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. If the fair
    value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its
    carrying amount, an impairment loss must be recognized equal to
    the difference.

Revenue recognition and promotional
    allowances.

Casino revenue is the aggregate net
    difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities
    recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play
    occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the
    customers’ possession (“outstanding chip
    liability”). Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and
    other operating revenues are recognized as services are
    performed. Advance deposits on rooms and advance ticket sales
    are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided
    to the customer.

Gaming revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives,
    including discounts and points earned in point-loyalty programs.
    The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other
    services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross
    revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. The
    estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is
    primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Reimbursed expenses.

The Company recognizes
    costs reimbursed pursuant to management services as revenue in
    the period it incurs the costs. Reimbursed costs related mainly
    to the Company’s management of CityCenter and totaled
    $99 million for 2009, $47 million for 2008, and
    $5 million for 2007.

Point loyalty programs.

The Company’s
    primary point-loyalty program, in operation at its wholly-owned
    major resorts and Aria, is Players Club. In Players Club,
    customers earn points based on their slots play, which can



be redeemed for cash or free play at any of the Company’s
    participating resorts. The Company records a liability based on
    the points earned times the redemption value and records a
    corresponding reduction in casino revenue. The expiration of
    unused points results in a reduction of the liability.
    Customers’ overall level of table games and slots play is
    also tracked and used by management in awarding discretionary
    complimentaries — free rooms, food and beverage and
    other services — for which no accrual is recorded.
    Other loyalty programs at the Company’s resorts generally
    operate in a similar manner, though they generally are available
    only to customers at the individual resorts. At
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the total company-wide
    liability for point-loyalty programs was $47 million and
    $52 million, respectively, including amounts classified as
    liabilities related to assets held for sale.

Advertising.

The Company expenses advertising
    costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising
    expense of continuing operations, which is generally included in
    general and administrative expenses, was $118 million,
    $122 million and $141 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Corporate expense.

Corporate expense
    represents unallocated payroll and aircraft costs, professional
    fees and various other expenses not directly related to the
    Company’s casino resort operations. In addition, corporate
    expense includes the costs associated with the Company’s
    evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, which are
    expensed as incurred until development of a specific project has
    become probable.

Preopening and

start-up

expenses.

Preopening and

start-up

costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred.
    Costs classified as preopening and

start-up

expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and
    other expenses related to new or

start-up

operations and new customer initiatives.

Property transactions, net.

The Company
    classifies transactions such as write-downs and impairments,
    demolition costs, and normal gains and losses on the sale of
    assets as “Property transactions, net.” See
    Note 17 for a detailed discussion of these amounts.

Income per share of common stock.

The
    weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares
    used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share
    consisted of the following:

The Company had a loss from continuing operations in 2009 and
    2008. Therefore, approximately 29 million and
    26 million shares, respectively underlying outstanding
    stock-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted
    earnings per share because inclusion would be anti-dilutive. In
    2007 shares underlying outstanding stock-based awards
    excluded from the diluted share calculation were not material.

Currency translation.

The Company translates
    the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which are not
    denominated in US dollars. Balance sheet accounts are translated
    at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date.
    Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of
    exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments
    resulting from this process are charged or credited to other
    comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income
    includes net income (loss) and all other non-stockholder changes
    in equity, or other comprehensive income. Elements of the
    Company’s other comprehensive income are



reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    stockholders’ equity, and the cumulative balance of these
    elements consisted of the following:

Recently Issued Accounting Standards.

The
    Company adopted various accounting standards during 2009, none
    of which had a material effect on its consolidated financial
    statements. In addition, certain amendments to Accounting
    Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 810
    “Consolidation” become effective for the Company
    beginning January 1, 2010. Such amendments include changes
    to the quantitative approach to determine the primary
    beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). An
    enterprise must determine if its variable interest or interests
    give it a controlling financial interest in a VIE by evaluating
    whether 1) the enterprise has the power to direct
    activities of the VIE that have a significant effect on economic
    performance, and 2) the enterprise has an obligation to
    absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity
    that could potentially be significant to the VIE. ASC 810 also
    requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the
    primary beneficiary of a VIE. The adoption of these amendments
    did not have a material effect on the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 4 —

ASSETS
    HELD FOR SALE AND DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

On March 20, 2009, the Company closed the sale of the
    Treasure Island casino resort (“TI”) to Ruffin
    Acquisition, LLC for net proceeds to the Company of
    approximately $746 million. At closing, the Company
    received $600 million in cash proceeds and a
    $175 million secured note bearing interest at 10% payable
    not later than 36 months after closing. Ruffin Acquisition,
    LLC exercised its option, provided for by an amendment to the
    purchase agreement, to prepay the note on or before
    April 30, 2009 and received a $20 million discount on
    the purchase price. In connection with the sale of TI, including
    the transfer of all of the membership interest in TI, TI was
    released as a guarantor of the outstanding indebtedness of the
    Company and its subsidiaries. The Company recognized a pre-tax
    gain of $187 million on the sale, which is included within
    “Property transactions, net.”

The assets and liabilities of TI are classified as held for sale
    as of December 31, 2008. However, the results of its
    operations have not been classified as discontinued operations
    because the Company expects to continue to receive significant
    cash flows from customer migration. The following table
    summarizes the assets held for sale and



liabilities related to assets held for sale in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets for the year ended December 31,
    2008:

In April 2007, the Company completed the sale of Buffalo
    Bill’s, Primm Valley, and Whiskey Pete’s casino
    resorts (the “Primm Valley Resorts”), not including
    the Primm Valley Golf Club, with net proceeds to the Company of
    approximately $398 million. In June 2007, the Company
    completed the sale of the Colorado Belle and Edgewater in
    Laughlin (the “Laughlin Properties”), with net
    proceeds to the Company of approximately $199 million.

The sale of the Primm Valley Resorts in April 2007 resulted in a
    pre-tax gain of $202 million and the sale of the Laughlin
    Properties in June 2007 resulted in a pre-tax gain of
    $64 million. The results of the Laughlin Properties and
    Primm Valley Resorts are classified as discontinued operations
    in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for
    the year ended 2007. In 2007, net revenues from discontinued
    operations were $129 million and interest allocated to
    discontinued operations based on the ratio of net assets of
    discontinued operations to total consolidated net assets and
    debt of the Company was approximately $6 million. The cash
    flows of discontinued operations are included with the cash
    flows of continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of cash flows.

NOTE 5 —

CITYCENTER
    TRANSACTION

In August 2007, the Company and Dubai World agreed to form a


/


joint venture for the CityCenter development. The joint venture,
    CityCenter Holdings, LLC, is owned equally by the Company and
    Infinity World. In November 2007 the Company contributed the
    CityCenter assets which the parties valued at $5.4 billion,
    subject to certain adjustments. Infinity World contributed
    $2.96 billion in cash. At the close of the transaction, the
    Company received a cash distribution of $2.47 billion, of
    which $22 million was repaid in 2008 to CityCenter as a
    result of a post-closing adjustment.

The initial contribution of the CityCenter assets was accounted
    for as a partial sale of real estate. As a partial sale, profit
    can be recognized when a seller retains an equity interest in
    the assets, but only to the extent of the outside equity
    interests, and only if the following criteria are met:
    1) the buyer is independent of the seller;
    2) collection of the sales price is reasonably assured; and
    3) the seller will not be required to support the
    operations of the property to an extent greater than its
    proportionate retained interest.

The transaction met criteria 1 and 3, despite the Company’s
    equity interest and ongoing management of the project, because
    the Company does not control the venture and the management and
    other agreements between the Company and CityCenter have been
    assessed as being fair market value contracts. In addition, the
    Company assessed whether it had a prohibited form of continuing
    involvement based on the presence of certain contingent
    repurchase options, including an option to purchase Infinity
    World’s interest if Infinity World or Dubai World is



denied required gaming approvals. The Company assessed the
    probability of such contingency as remote and, therefore,
    determined that a prohibited form of continuing involvement does
    not exist.

As described above, the Company did not receive the entire
    amount of the sales price, as a portion remained in the venture
    to fund near-term construction costs. Therefore, the Company
    believes that a portion of the gain does not meet criteria 2
    above and has been deferred. The Company recorded a gain of
    $1.03 billion based on the following (in millions):

The Company is accounting for its ongoing investment in
    CityCenter using the equity method, consistent with its other
    investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The Company determined
    that CityCenter is not a variable interest entity, based on the
    following: 1) CityCenter does not meet the scope exceptions
    for assessment as a variable interest entity; 2) the equity
    at risk in CityCenter is sufficient, based on qualitative
    assessments; 3) the equity holders of CityCenter (the
    Company and Infinity World) have the ability to control
    CityCenter and the right/obligation to receive/absorb expected
    returns/losses of CityCenter; and 4) while the
    Company’s 50% voting rights in CityCenter may not be
    proportionate to its rights/obligations to receive/absorb
    expected returns/losses given the fact that the Company manages
    CityCenter, substantially all of the activities of CityCenter do
    not involve and are not conducted on behalf of the Company.

Included in “Income (loss) from unconsolidated
    affiliates” for the year ended December 31, 2009 is
    the Company’s share of an impairment charge relating to
    CityCenter residential real estate under development
    (“REUD”). CityCenter was required to review its REUD
    for impairment as of September 30, 2009, mainly due to
    CityCenter’s September 2009 decision to discount the prices
    of its residential inventory by 30%. This decision and related
    market conditions led to CityCenter management’s conclusion
    that the carrying value of the REUD is not recoverable based on
    estimates of undiscounted cash flows. As a result, CityCenter
    was required to compare the fair value of its REUD to its
    carrying value and record an impairment charge for the
    shortfall. Fair value of the REUD was determined using a
    discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s current
    expectations of future cash flows. The key inputs in the
    discounted cash flow analysis included estimated sales prices of
    units currently under contract and new unit sales, the
    absorption rate over the sell-out period, and the discount rate.
    This analysis resulted in an impairment charge of approximately
    $348 million of the REUD. The Company recognized 50% of
    such impairment charge, adjusted by certain basis differences,
    resulting in a pre-tax charge of $203 million. Once the
    residential inventory is complete in the first quarter of 2010,
    CityCenter will be required to measure such inventory at the
    lower of a) its carrying value, or b) fair value less
    costs to sell. It is reasonably likely that the fair value less
    cost to sell of the residential inventory at completion will be
    below the inventory’s carrying value, and that the joint
    venture will be required to record an additional impairment
    charge at that time. The Company would record 50% of any such
    impairment, adjusted for certain basis differences.

During 2007, sales of units at The Signature at MGM Grand were
    completed and the joint venture essentially ceased sales
    operations. The Company recognized $93 million related to
    its share of profit from condominium sales, based on when sales
    were closed in 2007. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the
    Company purchased the remaining 88 units in Towers B and C
    from the joint venture for $39 million. These units have
    been recorded as property, plant and equipment in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

CityCenter.

In April 2009, the Company and
    Dubai World entered into an amended and restated joint venture
    agreement and CityCenter and its lenders entered into an
    amendment to the bank credit facility. These agreements provided
    funding for the completion of CityCenter. Under the revised
    agreements the Company provided an unlimited completion and cost
    overrun guarantee, secured by its interests in the assets of
    Circus Circus Las Vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped
    land —  see Note 13 for further discussion. The
    credit facility agreement also allowed for the first
    $244 million of net residential sales proceeds to be used
    to fund project costs which would otherwise be funded under the
    new completion guarantee. In addition, the amended provisions of
    the joint venture agreement provide that the first
    $494 million of available distributions must be distributed
    on a priority



basis to Infinity World, with the next $494 million of
    distributions made to the Company, and distributions shared
    equally thereafter.

As a result of the amendments to the joint venture agreement and
    the CityCenter credit facility, the Company concluded that it
    should reassess, as of June 30, 2009, whether CityCenter is
    a variable interest entity. The Company’s assessment
    confirmed its previous conclusion that CityCenter is not a
    variable interest entity and the equity method of accounting
    remains appropriate, as equity at risk is sufficient and the
    equity holders continue to control CityCenter and have the
    right/obligation to receive/absorb expected returns/losses of
    CityCenter. In addition, while the Company’s obligation to
    absorb expected losses is not proportionate to its 50% voting
    rights as a result of the changes to the completion guarantees,
    substantially all of the activities of CityCenter do not
    involve — and are not conducted on behalf
    of — the Company.

At September 30, 2009, the Company reviewed its CityCenter
    investment for impairment using revised operating forecasts
    developed by CityCenter management late in the third quarter. In
    addition, the impairment charge related to CityCenter’s
    residential real estate under development discussed below
    further indicated that the Company’s investment may have
    experienced an

“other-than-temporary”

decline in value. The Company’s discounted cash flow
    analysis for CityCenter included estimated future cash outflows
    for construction and maintenance expenditures and future cash
    inflows from operations, including residential sales. Based on
    its analysis, the Company determined that the carrying value of
    its investment exceeded its fair value and therefore an
    impairment was indicated. The Company intends to and believes it
    will be able to retain its investment in CityCenter; however,
    due to the extent of the shortfall and the Company’s
    assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering its
    investment, the Company determined that the impairment was

“other-than-temporary”

and recorded an impairment charge of $956 million included
    in “Property transactions, net.”

Borgata.

In May 2009, the New Jersey Division
    of Gaming Enforcement (the “DGE”) issued a report
    which recommended to the New Jersey Casino Control Commission
    (the “New Jersey Commission”) that, among other
    things, the Company’s Macau joint venture partner be found
    to be unsuitable and the Company be directed to disengage from
    any business association with such Macau joint venture partner.
    The Company is currently involved in constructive settlement
    discussions with the DGE, which have centered on the Company
    placing our 50% ownership interest in the Borgata Hotel Casino
    & Spa and related leased land in Atlantic City into a
    divestiture trust (the “Trust”) for which the Company
    would be the sole economic beneficiary. Any settlement is
    subject to both DGE and the New Jersey Commission approval.

In February 2010, the Company entered into an amendment to its
    joint venture agreement with Boyd Gaming Corporation
    (“Boyd”) to permit the transfer of its 50% ownership
    interest into the Trust in connection with its potential
    settlement agreement with the DGE. The amendment also includes
    the following provisions that would become effective only upon
    the transfer of the joint venture interests into Trust: Boyd
    would receive a priority partnership distribution of
    approximately $31 million (equal to the excess prior capital
    contributions by Boyd) upon successful refinancing of the
    Borgata credit facility; in addition, Boyd would receive a
    payment from the Trust equal to the greater of $10 million or 3%
    of the proceeds from the sale of the Company’s 50% interest
    in Borgata.

If the Company reaches a settlement agreement with the DGE, it
    will discontinue the equity method of accounting for Borgata at
    the point the assets are placed in the Trust and will account
    for its rights under the trust arrangement under the cost method
    of accounting. Earnings and losses that relate to the investment
    that were previously accrued will remain as a part of the
    carrying amount of the investment. Distributions received by the
    Trust in subsequent periods that do not exceed the
    Company’s share of earnings will be recognized currently in
    earnings. However, distributions to the Trust in subsequent
    periods that exceed the Company’s share of earnings for
    such periods will be applied to reduce the carrying amount of
    the Company’s investment.

In addition, due to circumstances surrounding the Company’s
    negotiations with the DGE, the Company has reviewed the carrying
    value of its 50% investment in the Borgata joint venture at
    December 31, 2009. The Company did not record an impairment
    charge related to its investment in the Borgata.

Basis differences.

The Company’s
    investment in unconsolidated affiliates does not equal the
    venture-level equity due to various basis differences. Basis
    differences related to depreciable assets are being amortized
    based on



the useful lives of the related assets and liabilities and basis
    differences related to non-depreciable assets are not being
    amortized. Differences between the Company’s venture-level

Goodwill related to the Mirage Resorts acquisition relates to
    Bellagio and The Mirage. The fair values of Bellagio and Mirage
    are substantially in excess of their carrying values including
    goodwill. Goodwill related to the Mandalay Resort Group
    acquisition was primarily assigned to Mandalay Bay, Luxor,
    Excalibur and Gold Strike Tunica. As a result of the
    Company’s annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth
    quarter of 2008, the Company recognized a non-cash impairment
    charge of goodwill of $1.2 billion — included in
    “Property transactions, net.” Such charge solely
    related to goodwill recognized in the Mandalay acquisition and
    represents the Company’s total accumulated impairment
    losses related to goodwill since January 1, 2002 when the
    Company adopted new accounting rules for goodwill and intangible
    assets. Assumptions used in such analysis were affected by
    current market conditions including: 1) lower market
    valuation multiples for gaming assets; 2) higher discount
    rates resulting from turmoil in the credit and equity markets;
    and 3) current cash flow forecasts for the affected
    resorts. The remaining balance of the Mandalay acquisition
    goodwill primarily relates to goodwill assigned to Gold Strike
    Tunica. The fair value of Gold Strike Tunica is substantially in
    excess of its carrying value including goodwill.



The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets balance of
    $334 million includes trademarks and trade names of
    $217 million related to the Mandalay acquisition. As a
    result of the Company’s annual impairment test in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 of indefinite-lived intangible assets,
    the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of
    $12 million — included in “Property
    transactions, net.” Such charge solely related to trade
    names recognized in the Mandalay acquisition. The fair value of
    the trade names was determined using the relief-from-royalty
    method and was negatively affected by the factors discussed
    above relating to the impairment of goodwill. The Company’s
    indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of
    development rights in Detroit and trademarks.

The Company’s remaining finite — lived intangible
    assets consist primarily of customer lists amortized over five
    years, lease acquisition costs amortized over the life of the
    related leases, and certain license rights amortized over their
    contractual life.

At December 31, 2009, outstanding senior notes due within
    one year of the balance sheet date were classified as current
    obligations as the Company’s senior credit facility was
    fully drawn at year end. Immediately following year end, the
    Company repaid $1.6 billion of its senior credit facility.
    The senior credit facility had a total capacity of
    $5.5 billion consisting of a term loan facility of
    $2.1 billion and a revolving credit facility of
    $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2009. The weighted
    average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the senior
    credit facility at December 31, 2009 and December 31,
    2008 was 6% and 3.4%, respectively. As discussed in Note 2,
    the Company entered into an amendment to its senior credit
    facility on February 25, 2010.

In conjunction with its May 2009 credit facility amendment, the
    Company permanently repaid $826 million of credit facility
    borrowings, and $400 million of previous repayments under
    separate amendments were treated as permanent reductions. In
    addition, the Company granted the lenders a security interest in
    the assets of Gold Strike Tunica and certain undeveloped land on
    the Las Vegas Strip to secure up to $300 million of
    obligations under the



credit facility, and MGM Grand Detroit, which is a co-borrower
    under the credit facility, granted lenders a security interest
    in its assets to secure its obligations under the credit
    facility. For the year ended December 31, 2009, the Company
    recorded a loss on early retirement of debt of $23 million
    related to amendments to its senior credit facility recorded
    within “Other, net.”

In May 2009, the Company issued $650 million of
    10.375% senior secured notes due 2014 and $850 million
    of 11.125% senior secured notes due 2017 for net proceeds
    to the Company of approximately $1.4 billion. The notes are
    secured by the equity interests and substantially all of the
    assets of Bellagio and The Mirage, and otherwise rank equally
    with the Company’s existing and future senior indebtedness.
    Upon the issuance of such notes, the holders of the
    Company’s 13% senior secured notes due 2013 obtained
    an equal and ratable lien in all collateral securing these
    notes. The Company’s 13% senior secured notes due 2013
    are secured by the equity interests and assets of New York-New
    York and otherwise rank equally with the Company’s existing
    and future senior indebtedness.

The Company’s senior credit facility limits the
    Company’s ability to sell assets and requires that
    (i) 50% of the net proceeds from certain future asset sales
    must be used to permanently reduce available borrowings under
    the senior credit facility and (ii) if MGM Grand
    Detroit is sold, the permanent reduction of available borrowings
    will not be less than $600 million. Also, under the
    indentures governing the Company’s senior secured notes,
    upon consummation of a non-collateral asset sale the Company is
    required to use the after-tax proceeds to 1) make an
    investment, an acquisition, or capital expenditures;
    2) permanently repay indebtedness that ranks equally in
    right of payment with the secured notes; or 3) make an
    offer to repurchase a corresponding amount of senior secured
    notes at par plus accrued interest. The secured note indentures
    also require that 75% of the consideration received for
    non-collateral asset sales must be in the form of cash or cash
    equivalents. For such purposes, any indebtedness of the Company
    validly released in writing in exchange for assets of the
    Company and any securities, notes or similar obligations
    converted by the Company into cash within 180 days will be
    deemed cash.

In June 2009, the Company redeemed the $100 million
    7.25% senior debentures at a cost of $127 million.
    Also, in June 2009, the Company redeemed, essentially at par,
    $762.6 million of its 6.0% senior notes due October
    2009 and $122.3 million of its 6.5% senior notes due
    July 2009 as a result of a tender offer process. In October 2009
    the Company repaid the remaining $57.4 million of its
    6.0% senior notes at maturity. The Company recorded a loss
    on early retirement of debt of $38 million related to these
    transactions recorded within “Other, net.”

In September 2009, the Company issued $475 million of
    11.375% senior notes due 2018 for net proceeds to the
    Company of $451 million which were used to pay down amounts
    outstanding under the senior credit facility, including a
    permanent reduction of $226 million as required by the
    senior credit facility.

During 2008, the Company executed the following transactions
    related to its senior notes and senior secured notes:

•

Issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of
    13% senior secured notes due 2013, at a discount to yield
    15% with net proceeds to the Company of $687 million;

•

Redeemed $149.4 million of the aggregate outstanding
    principal amount of its 7% debentures due 2036 pursuant to
    a one-time put option by the holders of such debentures;

•

Repurchased $345 million of principal amounts of various
    series of its outstanding senior notes at a purchase price of
    $263 million in open market repurchases under a plan
    authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors; and

•

Repaid the $180.4 million of 6.75% senior notes and
    the $196.2 million of 9.5% senior notes at maturity
    using borrowings under the senior credit facility.

The Company recognized a $6 million gain on the redemption
    of its 7% debentures and an $82 million gain on the
    senior note repurchases, included within “Other, net.”

The credit facility amendment in May 2009 eliminated the
    Company’s requirement to maintain a maximum leverage and
    interest charge ratio, and permanently waived any previous
    non-compliance with such ratio tests. At December 31, 2009,
    the Company was required to maintain a minimum trailing annual
    EBITDA (as defined) of $900 million. Additionally, the
    Company was limited to $250 million of annual capital
    expenditures (as defined)



during 2009. At December 31, 2009, the Company was in
    compliance with the minimum EBITDA and maximum capital
    expenditures covenants.

The Company and each of its material subsidiaries, excluding MGM
    Grand Detroit, LLC and the Company’s foreign subsidiaries,
    are directly liable for or unconditionally guarantee the senior
    credit facility, senior notes, senior debentures, and senior
    subordinated notes. MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is a guarantor under
    the senior credit facility, but only to the extent that MGM
    Grand Detroit, LLC borrows under such facilities. At
    December 31, 2009, the outstanding amount of borrowings
    related to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC was $450 million. See
    Note 19 for consolidating condensed financial information
    of the subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantors.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at
    December 31, 2009 was approximately $12.9 billion,
    versus its book value of $14.1 billion. At
    December 31, 2008, the estimated fair value of the
    Company’s long-term debt was approximately
    $8.5 billion, versus its book value of $13.5 billion.
    The estimated fair value of the Company’s senior and senior
    subordinated notes was based on quoted market prices on or about
    December 31, 2009 and 2008; the fair value of the
    Company’s senior credit facility is determined using
    estimates based on recent trading prices.

NOTE 12 —

INCOME
    TAXES

The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets, net of
    applicable reserves, related to net operating loss carryforwards
    and certain temporary differences. The Company recognizes future
    tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefit is
    more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is
    applied.

Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax
    includes a loss from foreign subsidiaries of $7 million in
    2009. Income (loss) from foreign subsidiaries in 2008 and 2007
    was not material.

For federal income tax purposes, the Company generated a net
    operating loss of $1.1 billion in 2009 and general business
    tax credits of $7 million in 2009 both of which it will
    carry back to and fully utilize in prior tax years.
    Consequently, the Company has recorded the tax effect of these
    items in “Income tax receivable” at December 31,
    2009. The Company has a charitable contribution carryforward of
    $3 million and a foreign tax credit carryforward of
    $2 million that will expire if not utilized by 2014 and
    2015, respectively.

For state income tax purposes, the Company has Illinois and
    Michigan net operating loss carryforwards of $21 million
    and $76 million, respectively, which equates to deferred
    tax assets, after federal tax effect, of $1 million and
    $3 million, respectively. The Illinois and Michigan net
    operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2021
    and 2019, respectively. The Company has New Jersey net operating
    loss carryforwards of $23 million, which equates to a
    deferred tax asset of $1 million, after federal tax effect,
    and before valuation allowance. The New Jersey net operating
    loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by various dates
    from 2010 through 2029.

At December 31, 2009, there is a $2 million valuation
    allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain New Jersey
    state net operating loss carryforwards and other New Jersey
    state deferred tax assets and a valuation allowance of
    $2 million on the foreign tax credit because management
    believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than
    not” criteria for recognition. Management believes all
    other deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be
    realized because of the future reversal of existing taxable
    temporary differences and expected future taxable income.
    Accordingly, there are no other valuation allowances provided at
    December 31, 2009.

The Company assesses its tax position using a two-step process.
    A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely
    than not” threshold, and is measured at the largest amount
    of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of



being realized. Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each
    balance sheet date. Liabilities recorded as a result of this
    analysis must generally be recorded separately from any current
    or deferred income tax accounts, and at December 31, 2009,
    the Company has classified $5 million as current in
    “Other accrued liabilities” and $181 million as
    long-term in “Other long-term obligations,” based on
    the time until expected payment.

The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was
    $34 million and $29 million at December 31, 2009
    and December 31, 2008, respectively.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had
    $24 million and $17 million in interest related to
    unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2009
    and December 31, 2008, respectively. No amounts were
    accrued for penalties as of either date. Income tax expense for
    the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 includes
    interest related to unrecognized tax benefits of
    $8 million, $6 million, and $7 million,
    respectively.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal
    jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign
    jurisdictions, although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions
    are not material. As of December 31, 2009, the Company was
    no longer subject to examination of its U.S. consolidated
    federal income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2003.
    In the fourth quarter of 2009, the Company reached settlement
    with the IRS in post-Appeals mediation with respect to issues
    related to a land sale transaction in 2002. The Company agreed
    to an additional tax liability of $2 million and associated
    interest for the 2002 tax year as a result of this settlement.
    The Company paid most of this tax and associated interest in a
    prior year in order to minimize the amount of interest due. All
    matters concerning the IRS audit of the 2001 and 2002 federal
    income tax returns are now settled. The IRS is currently
    examining the Company’s federal income tax returns for the
    2003 and 2004 tax years. The Company anticipates this audit will
    close sometime in 2010 and the Company will likely protest many
    of the issues under audit. Consequently, the Company does not
    believe that it is reasonably possible that these issues will be
    settled in the next twelve months. Federal income tax returns
    for years of the Company subsequent to 2004 are also subject to
    examination.

During 2009, the IRS completed its audit of the 2004 through
    2006 tax years of a subsidiary of the Company treated as a
    partnership for income tax purposes and the Company submitted a
    protest to IRS Appeals with respect to issues relating to the
    tax treatment of payments made by the subsidiary under an
    agreement to develop, own and operate a hotel casino in the City
    of Detroit. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible
    that these issues may be settled in the next twelve months.

During 2009, the IRS completed its audit of an unconsolidated
    affiliate of the Company for the 2003 and 2004 tax years and the
    Company along with its joint venture partner submitted a protest
    to IRS Appeals of various issues raised by the IRS in the audit.
    It is reasonably possible that certain of these issues may be
    settled in the next twelve months, but others may not.

In the first quarter of 2010, the IRS informed the Company that
    it was closing its examination of the federal income tax return
    of Mandalay Resort Group for the pre-acquisition year ended
    April 25, 2005 and will issue a “No-Change
    Letter.” The statute of limitations for assessing tax for
    the Mandalay Resort Group federal income tax return



for the year ended January 31, 2005 has been extended but
    such return is not currently under examination by the IRS.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company was no longer subject
    to examination of its various state and local tax returns filed
    for years ended prior to 2005. During 2009, the state of
    Illinois notified the Company that it would initiate an audit of
    the Illinois combined returns of the Company for the 2006 and
    2007 tax years. The Company anticipates this audit will begin
    during 2010. A Mandalay Resort Group subsidiary return for the
    pre-acquisition year ended April 25, 2005 is under
    examination by the City of Detroit and the statute of
    limitations for assessing tax will expire in 2010 unless
    extended. No other state or local income tax returns of the
    Company are currently under exam.

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the
    total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
    2009 may decrease by a range of $0 to $9 million
    within the next twelve months on the expectation during such
    period of: (1) possible settlement of the appeal of the
    issues raised in the IRS audit of the 2004 through 2006 tax
    years of a subsidiary of the Company; (2) possible
    settlement of certain issues under appeal in connection with the
    IRS audit of the 2003 and 2004 tax years of an unconsolidated
    affiliate; and (3) the closure of the IRS audit of the
    federal income tax return of Mandalay Resort Group for the
    pre-acquisition year ended April 25, 2005.

North Las Vegas Strip Joint Venture.

In
    September 2007, the Company entered into a definitive agreement
    with Kerzner International and Istithmar forming a joint venture
    to develop a multi-billion dollar integrated resort to be
    located on the southwest corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and
    Sahara Avenue. In September 2008, the Company and its partners
    agreed to defer additional design and pre-construction
    activities and amended their joint venture agreement
    accordingly. In April 2009, the Company funded its
    $13 million share of pre-development costs to date, and was
    relieved of its obligation to contribute land to the joint
    venture. Either partner now has the right to dissolve



the joint venture at any time and the design and
    pre-construction activities will remain postponed until such
    time as the partners agree to move forward with the project. The
    Company does not expect to progress with this project until
    general economic conditions and the Company’s financial
    position improve.

CityCenter completion guarantee.

As discussed
    in Note 8, in April 2009 the Company entered into a new
    completion guarantee in conjunction with the CityCenter credit
    facility which amended the completion guarantees to
    a) relieve Dubai World of its completion guarantee as
    amounts are funded from its letter of credit, and
    b) require an unlimited completion and cost overrun
    guarantee from the Company, secured by its interests in the
    assets of Circus Circus Las Vegas and certain adjacent
    undeveloped land. Also affecting the potential exposure under
    the completion guarantee is the ability to utilize up to
    $244 million of net residential proceeds to fund
    construction costs, though the timing of receipt of such
    proceeds is uncertain. As of December 31, 2009, the Company
    has recorded a liability of $150 million, classified as
    “Other accrued liabilities,” which represents the low
    end of its estimated range for its net obligation under the
    completion guarantee. The Company believes that it is reasonably
    possible it will be required to fund a net obligation of up to
    $300 million. In January and February 2010 the Company
    funded $217 million under the completion guarantee.
    CityCenter will repay such amounts to the Company from proceeds
    of residential units.

Other guarantees.

The Company is party to
    various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business,
    which are generally supported by letters of credit issued by
    financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit
    facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be
    issued to $250 million, and the amount of available
    borrowings under the senior credit facility is reduced by any
    outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company had provided $37 million of total letters of
    credit. Though not subject to a letter of credit, the Company
    has an agreement with the Nevada Gaming Control Board to
    maintain $113 million of cash at the corporate level to
    support normal bankroll requirements at the Company’s
    Nevada operations.

New Jersey regulatory review of Macau
    investment.

As a result of the DGE’s
    investigation of the Company’s relationship with its joint
    venture partner in Macau, the Company is involved in
    constructive settlement discussions with the DGE under which it
    would sell its 50% ownership interest in Borgata and related
    leased land in Atlantic City — see Note 8 for a
    discussion of the investigation and settlement discussions. If
    the Company is unable to effectuate such a settlement with the
    DGE, it may still be subject to action by the New Jersey
    Commission related to the DGE’s report.

The DGE is responsible for investigating licensees and
    prosecuting matters before the New Jersey Commission. However,
    the report is merely a recommendation and is not binding on the
    New Jersey Commission, which has sole responsibility and
    authority for deciding all regulatory and licensing matters. The
    New Jersey Commission has not yet taken any action with respect
    to the report, but on July 27, 2009, the DGE submitted a
    letter to the New Jersey Commission recommending that the New
    Jersey Commission reopen the licensing of Borgata to address the
    ongoing suitability of the Company as a licensee; under New
    Jersey regulations, the New Jersey Commission is obligated to
    reopen the licensing. This was a procedural step required by the
    New Jersey Casino Control Act that does not represent a finding
    as to the issues raised by the DGE. The Company will have the
    opportunity to respond to the DGE report in an open public
    proceeding.

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters
    incidental to its business. Management does not believe that the
    outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect
    on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations.

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Tender offer.

In February 2008, the Company
    and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dubai World completed a joint
    tender offer to purchase 15 million shares of Company
    common stock at a price of $80 per share. The Company purchased
    8.5 million shares at a total purchase price of
    $680 million.

Stock sale to Infinity World.

On
    October 18, 2007, the Company completed the sale of
    14.2 million shares of common stock to Infinity World
    Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dubai World, at a
    price of $84 per share for total proceeds of approximately
    $1.2 billion. These shares were previously held by the
    Company as treasury stock. Proceeds from the sale were used to
    reduce amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility.



Secondary stock offering.

In May 2009, the
    Company issued approximately 164.5 million shares,
    including approximately 21.5 million shares issued as a
    result of the underwriters exercising their over-allotment
    option, of its common stock at $7 per share, for total net
    proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.1 billion. A
    portion of the shares were previously held by the Company as
    treasury stock and a portion of the shares were newly issued.
    Proceeds from the common stock offering and concurrent offering
    of senior secured notes were used to repay outstanding amounts
    under the Company’s senior credit facility and redeem
    certain outstanding senior debentures and senior notes and for
    general corporate purposes.

Stock repurchases.

Share repurchases are only
    conducted under repurchase programs approved by the Board of
    Directors and publicly announced. At December 31, 2009, the
    Company had 20 million shares available for repurchase
    under the May 2008 authorization. Share repurchase activity was

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Information about the Company’s share-based
    awards.

The Company adopted an omnibus incentive
    plan in 2005 which, as amended, allows it to grant stock
    options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”),
    restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and
    other stock-based awards to eligible directors, officers and
    employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The plans are
    administered by the Compensation Committee (the
    “Committee”) of the Board of Directors. The Committee
    has discretion under the omnibus plan regarding which type of
    awards to grant, the vesting and service requirements, exercise
    price and other conditions, in all cases subject to certain
    limits, including:

•

As amended, the omnibus plan allows for the issuance of up to
    35 million (20 million prior to an August 2008
    amendment) shares or share-based awards; and

•

For stock options and SARs, the exercise price of the award must
    be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock on the
    date of grant and the maximum term of such an award is
    10 years.

Stock options and SARs granted under all plans generally have
    terms of either seven or ten years, and in most cases vest in
    either four or five equal annual installments. RSUs granted vest
    ratably over 4 years. The Company’s practice is to
    issue new shares upon exercise or vesting of awards.



Activity under share-based payment plans.

As
    of December 31, 2009, the aggregate number of share-based
    awards available for grant under the omnibus plan was
    13.0 million. A summary of activity under the
    Company’s share-based payment plans for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 is presented below:

As of December 31, 2009, there was a total of
    $55 million of unamortized compensation related to
    restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over
    a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. $47 million of
    such unamortized compensation relates to the RSUs granted in our
    2008 exchange offer. RSUs granted to corporate officers are
    subject to certain performance requirements determined by the
    Committee. Such performance requirements do not apply to RSUs
    granted in the exchange offer.

Recognition of compensation cost.

The Company
    recognizes the estimated fair value of stock options and SARs
    granted under the Company’s omnibus plan based on the
    estimated fair value of these awards measured at the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes model. For restricted stock units,
    compensation cost is calculated based on the fair market value
    of its stock on the date of grant. For stock options awards
    granted prior to January 1, 2006, the unamortized expense
    is being recognized on an accelerated basis. For all awards
    granted after January 1, 2006, such expense is being
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of
    the awards. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, with
    such estimate updated periodically and with actual forfeitures
    recognized currently to the



extent they differ from the estimate. The Company capitalizes
    stock-based compensation related to employees dedicated to
    construction activities. In addition, the Company charges
    CityCenter for stock-based compensation related to employees
    dedicated to CityCenter.

Expected volatility is based in part on historical volatility
    and in part on implied volatility based on traded options on the
    Company’s stock. The expected term considers the
    contractual term of the option as well as historical exercise
    and forfeiture behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on
    the rates in effect on the grant date for U.S. Treasury
    instruments with maturities matching the relevant expected term
    of the award.

NOTE 16 —

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

Employees of the Company who are members of various unions are
    covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained,
    multi-employer health and welfare and defined benefit pension
    plans. The Company recorded an expense of $177 million in
    2009, $192 million in 2008 and $194 million in 2007
    under such plans. The plans’ sponsors have not provided
    sufficient information to permit the Company to determine its
    share of unfunded vested benefits, if any.

The Company is self-insured for most health care benefits and
    workers compensation for its non-union employees. The liability
    for health care claims filed and estimates of claims incurred
    but not reported was $20 million and $22 million at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The workers
    compensation liability for claims filed and estimates of claims
    incurred but not reported was $27 million and
    $28 million as of December 31, 2009 and
    December 31, 2008, respectively. Both liabilities are
    included in “Other accrued liabilities.”

The Company has retirement savings plans under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for eligible
    employees. The plans allow employees to defer, within prescribed
    limits, up to 30% of their income on a pre-tax basis through
    contributions to the plans. The Company suspended contributions
    to the plan in 2009, though certain employees at MGM Grand
    Detroit and Four Seasons were still eligible for matching
    contributions. In the case of



certain union employees, the Company contributions to the plan
    are based on hours worked. The Company recorded charges for
    401(k) contributions of $25 million in 2008 and
    $27 million in 2007.

The Company maintains nonqualified deferred retirement plans for
    certain key employees. The plans allow participants to defer, on
    a pre-tax basis, a portion of their salary and bonus and
    accumulate tax deferred earnings, plus investment earnings on
    the deferred balances, as a deferred tax savings. Through
    December 31, 2008 participants earned a Company match of up
    to 4% of salary, net of any Company match received under the
    Company’s 401(k) plan. In 2009, the Company suspended
    contributions to the plan. All employee deferrals vest
    immediately. The Company matching contributions vest ratably
    over a three-year period. The Company recorded charges for
    matching contributions of $1 million in both 2008 and 2007.

The Company also maintains nonqualified supplemental executive
    retirement plans (“SERP”) for certain key employees.
    Until September 2008, the Company made quarterly contributions
    intended to provide a retirement benefit that is a fixed
    percentage of a participant’s estimated final five-year
    average annual salary, up to a maximum of 65%. The Company has
    indefinitely suspended these contributions. Employees do not
    make contributions under these plans. A portion of the Company
    contributions and investment earnings thereon vest after three
    years of SERP participation and the remaining portion vests
    after both five years of SERP participation and 10 years of
    continuous service. The Company recorded expense under this plan
    of $4 million in 2008 and $7 million in 2007.

Pursuant to the amendments of the nonqualified deferred
    retirement plans and SERP plans during 2008, and consistent with
    certain transitional relief provided by the Internal Revenue
    Service pursuant to rules governing nonqualified deferred
    compensation, the Company permitted participants under the plans
    to make a one-time election to receive, without penalty, all or
    a portion of their respective vested account balances. Based on
    elections made, the Company made payments to participants of
    $62 million in 2009. In addition, the Company made payments
    of $57 million to participants in 2008 related to previous
    versions of these plans that were terminated during the year.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company and CityCenter have entered into agreements whereby
    the Company is responsible for management of the design,
    planning, development and construction of CityCenter and is
    managing the operations of CityCenter for a fee. The Company is
    being reimbursed for certain costs in performing its development
    and management services. During the years ended
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company incurred
    $95 million and $46 million, respectively of costs
    reimbursable by the joint venture, primarily for employee
    compensation and certain allocated costs. As of
    December 31, 2009, CityCenter owes the Company
    $52 million for unreimbursed development and operations
    services costs.

Borgata leases 10 acres from the Company on a long-term
    basis for use in its current operations and for its expansion,
    and nine acres from the Company on a short-term basis for
    surface parking. Total payments received from Borgata under
    these lease agreements were $6 million in each of the years
    ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

The Company paid legal fees to a firm that was affiliated with
    the Company’s former general counsel. Payments to the firm
    totaled $15 million, $10 million, and $11 million
    for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    respectively. The Company owed the firm $1 million and
    $2 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Members of the Company’s Board of Directors, senior
    management, and Tracinda signed contracts in 2007 for the
    purchase of condominium units at CityCenter, at prices
    consistent with prices charged to unrelated third parties, when
    CityCenter was a wholly-owned development. The Company collected
    $6 million of deposits related to such purchases in 2007.

Because income per share amounts are calculated using the
    weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent
    shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share
    amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total income per
    share amounts for the year.

    $548 million impairment charge related to its Renaissance

    investment and a $203 million charge related to its share
    of the CityCenter residential impairment. These impairments were
    recorded in the third quarter of 2009, and resulted in a $1.70
    impact on third quarter of 2009 diluted loss per share and a
    $1.98 impact on full year 2009 diluted loss per share.

As discussed in Note 3, the Company recorded a $176

    per share.

As discussed in Note 4, the Company sold TI in the first

    diluted income per share and a $0.31 impact on the full year
    2009 diluted loss per share.
