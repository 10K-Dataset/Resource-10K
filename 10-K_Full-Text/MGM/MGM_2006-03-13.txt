PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

Overview

MGM MIRAGE is one of the largest gaming companies in the world. We believe that we
own the world’s finest collection of casino resorts. Our strategy is predicated on
creating resorts of memorable character, treating our employees well and providing
superior service for our guests. MGM MIRAGE was organized as MGM Grand, Inc. on January
29, 1986 and is a Delaware corporation. MGM MIRAGE acts largely as a holding company and
its operations are conducted through wholly-owned subsidiaries. MGM MIRAGE is
referred to as the “Company” or the “Registrant,” and together with our subsidiaries may
also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.”

Acquisition of Mandalay Resort Group

On April 25, 2005, we closed our merger with Mandalay Resort Group (“Mandalay”)
under which we acquired Mandalay for $71 in cash for each share of common stock of
Mandalay. The total acquisition cost, including the assumption of debt and
transaction costs, was approximately $7.3 billion. As a result of the acquisition we
are a much larger company, with ownership of or investments in 26 casino resorts versus
13, over 66,000 employees versus 40,000, and total assets of over $20 billion versus $11
billion. The acquisition expands our portfolio of resorts on the Las
Vegas Strip, provides additional sites for future development and expands our employee
and customer bases significantly.

MGM Grand Detroit

MGM Grand Detroit is our interim casino facility in Detroit, Michigan. MGM Grand
Detroit is one of three casinos licensed in Detroit and is operated by MGM Grand
Detroit, LLC. MGM Grand Detroit, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, holds a

Hurricane Katrina and has been closed since. We expect to reopen Beau Rivage in stages beginning in the
third quarter of 2006. The damage was primarily concentrated on the lower levels,
including the casino, restaurant and retail areas. We intend to rebuild Beau Rivage at
its existing beachfront site where Interstate 110 meets the Gulf Coast in Biloxi,
Mississippi. When fully reopened, Beau Rivage will include 1,740 guest rooms, over 2,000 slot
machines and 90 table games, new and restored restaurants, a state-of-the-art convention

additional 388 acres of land that may be used for future development.



Borgata

The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa is located at Renaissance Pointe in Atlantic City,
New Jersey. In addition to its 2,000 guest rooms and suites and extensive gaming floor,
Borgata includes several specialty restaurants, retail shops, a European-style health
spa, meeting space and unique entertainment venues. Borgata was the first new casino in
Atlantic City in over 13 years when it opened in July 2003. Through a wholly-owned subsidiary, we own 50% of the limited
liability company that owns Borgata. Boyd Gaming Corporation (“Boyd”) owns the other
50% and also operates the resort.

Borgata is currently expanding its gaming and non-gaming amenities, adding 36
casino table games and 500 slot machines, expanding its poker room and race book, and
adding additional restaurant, entertainment and other amenities. This $200 million
project is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2006. Additionally,
Borgata has plans to add another hotel tower, the Water Club at Borgata, featuring 800
guestrooms and suites, along with a new spa, parking garage and meeting rooms. This
$325 million project is expected to be completed in late 2007. Neither project is
expected to require contributions from us, as existing operating cash flow and Borgata’s
recently renegotiated bank credit facility is anticipated to provide for the cost of the
expansions.

Grand Victoria

Through wholly-owned entities, we are a 50% participant with RBG, L.P. in an entity
which owns Grand Victoria, a Victorian-themed riverboat casino and land-based
entertainment complex in Elgin, Illinois, a suburb approximately 40 miles northwest of
downtown Chicago. The riverboat offers dockside gaming, which means its operation is

Tom Fazio and located approximately ten miles north of our Las Vegas Strip resorts.
Shadow Creek is ranked 3

rd

Public Courses. We also own and operate the Primm Valley Golf Club, located four miles
south of the Primm Valley Resorts in California, which includes two 18-hole championship
courses. These golf courses were also designed by Tom Fazio.

Future Development

Project CityCenter

In November 2004 we announced a plan to develop a multi-billion dollar urban
metropolis, Project CityCenter, on 66 acres of land on the Las Vegas Strip, between
Bellagio and Monte Carlo. Project CityCenter will feature a 4,000-room casino resort
designed by world-famous architect Cesar Pelli; two 400-room non-gaming boutique hotels,
one of which will be managed by luxury hotelier Mandarin Oriental; approximately 470,000
square feet of retail shops, dining and entertainment venues; and approximately 2.3
million square feet of residential space in over 2,900 luxury condominium and
condominium-hotel units in multiple towers.

As currently contemplated, we believe Project CityCenter will cost approximately $7
billion, excluding preopening and land costs. After estimated proceeds of $2.5 billion
from the sale of residential units, we believe the net project cost will be
approximately $4.5 billion. We expect to complete the design work for Project
CityCenter in mid-2006 and expect the project to open in 2009. The design, budget and
schedule of Project CityCenter are still preliminary, and the ultimate timing, cost and
scope of Project CityCenter are subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects.

Detroit, Michigan

MGM Grand Detroit, LLC has operated an interim casino facility in downtown Detroit
since July 1999. In August 2002 the Detroit City Council approved revised development
agreements with our subsidiary and two other developers. The revised development
agreement released us and the City from certain of the obligations under the original
agreement and significantly changed other provisions of the original agreement.

In April 2005, the 6

th

Circuit Court of Appeals lifted its injunction
prohibiting commencement of construction of the permanent hotel and casino complexes. We
have obtained land and began construction on our permanent facility, which will be
located near the site of our interim facility. The permanent facility is expected to
open in late 2007 at a cost of approximately $765 million, including land and preopening
costs, and will feature a 400-room hotel, 100,000-square foot casino, numerous
restaurant and entertainment amenities, and spa and convention facilities. The complete
design, timing and cost of the permanent facility are at a preliminary stage, and are
subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects.



Macau

We own 50% of MGM Grand Paradise Limited, an entity which is developing, and will
operate, MGM Grand Macau, a hotel-casino resort in Macau S.A.R. Pansy Ho Chiu-king owns
the other 50% of MGM Grand Paradise Limited. MGM Grand Macau will be located on a prime
waterfront site and will feature at least 345 table games and 1,035 slots with room for
significant expansion. Other features will include a 600-room hotel, a luxurious spa,
convertible convention space, a variety of dining
destinations, and other attractions. Construction of MGM Grand Macau, which is estimated to cost $1.1 billion including license and land rights and preopening costs,
began in the second quarter of 2005 and the resort is anticipated to open in late 2007. The complete design, timing, cost and scope of the project are at a
preliminary stage and are subject to the risks attendant to large-scale projects. We
have invested $180 million in the venture, and are committed to loaning the venture up
to $100 million. The venture has obtained commitments from lenders for a credit
facility sufficient, along with equity contributions and shareholder loans, to fund the
construction of MGM Grand Macau.

New York Racing Association

We have entered into a definitive agreement with the New York Racing Association
(“NYRA”) to manage video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) at NYRA’s Aqueduct horseracing
facility in metropolitan New York. We will assist in the development of the
approximately $170 million facility, including providing project financing, and will
manage the facility for a term of five years, extended automatically if the financing
provided by us is not fully repaid, for a fee. Recent legislative changes will allow us
to operate the VLTs past the expiration date of the current NYRA franchise
agreement.

Atlantic City, New Jersey

We own approximately 130 acres on Renaissance Pointe in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
We lease 10 acres to Borgata under long-term leases for use in its current operations
and for its expansion. Of the remaining 120 acres, approximately 72 acres are suitable
for development. We lease nine of these acres to Borgata on a short-term basis for
surface parking and a portion of the remaining acres consists of common roads,
landscaping and master plan improvements which we designed and developed as required by
our agreement with Boyd. We own an additional 15 developable acres in the Marina District
near Renaissance Pointe.

We must apply for and receive numerous governmental permits and satisfy other
conditions before construction of a new resort on the Renaissance Pointe site could
begin. No assurance can be given that we will develop a casino resort in New Jersey, or
its ultimate schedule, size, configuration or cost if we do develop a casino resort.

United Kingdom

We continue to pursue development opportunities in the United Kingdom. We have
entered into agreements or have formed strategic alliances with several companies in
order to further these development efforts. We are currently pursuing opportunities in
Birmingham, Glasgow, Newcastle and Sheffield. These opportunities are subject to certain
conditions, including obtaining regional casino licenses and regulatory approvals, and
the implementation of an acceptable tax regime. The Gambling Act 2005 includes
authorization for only one initial regional casino (unlimited table games and a maximum
of 1,250 slot machines) and eight large casinos (unlimited table games and a maximum of
150 slot machines), a significant reduction from previous proposals. The Gambling Act
2005 allows for an increase in the number of regional casinos, but it is uncertain
whether more regional casinos will be approved in the near term.

Singapore

In 2005 we agreed to form a joint venture with CapitaLand, a listed company in
Singapore, to pursue one of two gaming licenses in Singapore. We will own 60% of the joint
venture and would manage the resort. In April 2005, we and our partner CapitaLand,
together with 11 other applicants, were successful in qualifying for the second round of
the proposal process for the development of an integrated resort complex in the Marina
Bayfront of Singapore. The Singapore government issued the request for proposals in the
fourth quarter of 2005 and we are in the process of preparing our proposal response.
Only three other bidders have indicated they expect to submit responses for the Marina site.



Other

We regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in both the
domestic and international markets. These opportunities may include the ownership,
management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada or in
states other than Nevada or outside of the United States. We may undertake these
opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.
Development and operation of any gaming facility in a new jurisdiction is subject to
many contingencies. Several of these contingencies are outside of our control and may
include the passage of appropriate gaming legislation, the issuance of necessary
permits, licenses and approvals, the availability of appropriate financing and the
satisfaction of other conditions. We cannot be sure that we will decide or be able to
proceed with any acquisition or expansion opportunities.

Operations

We operate primarily in one segment, the operation of casino resorts, which
includes offering gaming, hotel, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort
amenities. Giving effect to the Mandalay merger, over half of our net revenue is now
derived from non-gaming activities, a higher percentage than many of our competitors, as
our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests,
including non-gaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality. We
believe that we own several of the premier casino resorts in the world, and a main focus
of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain our competitive
advantage.

As a resort-based company, our operating results are highly dependent on the volume
of customers at our resorts, which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel
rooms and other amenities. We also generate a significant portion of our operating
income from the high-end gaming segment, which can cause variability in our results.

Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers wagering with cash
or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our resorts, like many in
the industry, generate significant operating cash flow. Our industry is capital
intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash
flow to repay debt financing, fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess
cash for future development.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of
factors can affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major Las
Vegas conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our
high-end customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and
Chinese New Year. Our significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to maximize
hotel occupancy and customer volumes during off-peak times such as mid-week or during traditionally slower leisure
travel periods, which also leads to better labor utilization.

All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours each day, every day of the year, with
the exception of Grand Victoria which operates 22 hours a day, every day of the year.
Our primary casino operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may
be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or
leased to third parties. We generally have an operating philosophy that prefers
ownership of amenities, since guests have direct contact with staff in these areas and
we prefer to control all aspects of the guest experience. However, we do
lease space to retail and food and beverage operators in certain situations,
particularly for branding opportunities. We also operate many “managed” outlets,
utilizing third party management for specific expertise in areas such as restaurants and
nightclubs, as well as for branding opportunities. Since we believe that the number of
walk-in customers also affects the success of our casino resorts, we design our
facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other hotels.

We utilize technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our operations. We are
in the process of combining our Players Club with Mandalay’s One Club program. When the
process is complete, Players Club will link our major resorts, and consolidate all slots
and table games activity for customers with a Players Club account. Under the combined
program, customers will qualify for benefits across all of these resorts, regardless of
where they play. We believe that our Players Club enables us to more effectively market
to our customers. A significant portion of the slot machines at our resorts operate
with International Game Technology’s EZ-Pay™ cashless gaming system, including the
Mandalay resorts where we recently converted many of the slot machines to EZ-Pay™. We
believe that this system enhances the customer experience and increases the revenue
potential of our slot machines.

Technology is a critical part of our strategy in non-gaming operations and
administrative areas as well. Our hotel systems include yield management modules which
allow us to maximize occupancy and room rates. Additionally, these systems capture most
charges made by our customers during their stay, including allowing customers of any of
our resorts to charge meals and services at other MGM MIRAGE resorts to their hotel
accounts. We are implementing a new hotel management system at all our resorts in 2006
and 2007, which we expect will enhance our guest service and improve our yield management across
our portfolio of resorts.



Marketing and Competition

General

Our casino resorts generally operate in highly competitive environments. We compete
against other gaming companies as well as other hospitality and leisure and business
travel companies. Our primary methods of competing successfully in a competitive
environment include:

Customers and Competition

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other
hotel-casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel-casinos on or near the Las
Vegas Strip, major hotel-casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from
the center of the Strip, and several major facilities elsewhere in the Las Vegas area.
According to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, there were approximately
133,200 guestrooms in Las Vegas at December 31, 2005, up 1% from approximately 131,500
rooms at December 31, 2004. Las Vegas visitor volume was 38.6 million in 2005, a 3%
increase from the 37.4 million reported for 2004. The principal segments of the Las
Vegas gaming market are leisure travel, premium gaming customers, conventions, including
small meetings and corporate incentive programs, and tour and travel. Our high-end
properties, which include Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, and The Mirage,
appeal to the upper end of each market segment, balancing their business by using the
convention and tour and travel segments to fill the mid-week and off-peak periods. Our
marketing strategy for TI, New York-New York, Luxor and Monte Carlo is aimed at
attracting middle- to upper-middle-income wagerers, largely from the leisure travel and,
to a lesser extent, the tour and travel segments. Excalibur and Circus Circus Las Vegas
generally cater to the value-oriented and middle-income leisure travel and tour and travel
segments.

Outside Las Vegas, our other wholly-owned Nevada operations, including those in Reno and
Laughlin, compete with each other and with many other similar sized and larger
operations. A significant portion of our customers at these resorts come from California. We believe the
expansion of Native American gaming has had a negative impact on all of our Nevada
resorts not located on the Las Vegas Strip, and the anticipated additional expansion in
California could have a further adverse effect on these resorts. Our Nevada resorts not
located in Las Vegas appeal primarily to middle-income customers attracted by room, food
and beverage and entertainment prices that are lower than those offered by major Las
Vegas hotel-casinos. Our target customer for these resorts is the value-oriented leisure
traveler and the value-oriented local customer.

Outside Nevada, our wholly-owned resorts mainly compete for customers in local
gaming markets, where location is a critical success factor. In Tunica, Mississippi, one of our competitors is closer to Memphis, the area’s
principal market. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding
jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region. For instance, in Detroit,
Michigan we also compete with a casino in nearby Windsor, Canada. In Biloxi,
Mississippi we also compete with regional riverboat and land-based casinos in Louisiana, Native American casinos in central Mississippi, the south Florida leisure
market, and with casinos in the Bahamas.

Our unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against casino resorts
in their respective markets, and in some cases against our wholly-owned operations.
Much like our wholly-owned resorts, our unconsolidated affiliates compete through the
quality of amenities, the value of the experience offered to guests, and the location of
their resorts.

Our Company’s facilities also compete for gaming customers with hotel-casino
operations located in other areas of the United States and other parts of the world, and
for leisure and business travelers with non-gaming tourist destinations such as Hawaii,
Florida and cruise ships. Our hotel-casinos compete to a lesser extent with
state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, and other forms of
legalized gaming in the United States.



Marketing

We advertise on radio, television and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in
selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as on the Internet and by direct
mail. We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major United
States and foreign cities. A key element of marketing to premium gaming customers is
personal contact by our marketing personnel. Direct marketing is also important in the
convention segment. We maintain Internet websites which inform customers about our
resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms and make restaurant and show
reservations. We also operate call centers to allow customer contact by phone to make
hotel, restaurant and show reservations.

We utilize our world-class golf courses in marketing programs at our Las Vegas
Strip and other Nevada resorts. Our major Las Vegas resorts offer luxury suite packages
that include golf privileges at Shadow Creek. In connection with our marketing
activities, we also invite our premium gaming customers to play Shadow Creek on a
complimentary basis. We use Primm Valley Golf Club for marketing purposes at our Las
Vegas and Primm resorts, including offering room and golf packages at special rates.

Competitive Risks

The principal negative factors relating to our competitive position are:

Control Over Gaming Activities

General

In connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos, we maintain
stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements. These controls
include:

Issuance of Markers

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Bellagio,
MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize
marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at certain of
those casinos as well.

We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue
collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These
collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing
with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency
notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation.
A significant portion of our Company’s accounts receivable, for amounts unpaid
resulting from markers which are not collectible through banking channels, is owed by
major casino customers from the Far East. The collectibility of unpaid markers is
affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and
economic conditions in the customers’ home countries.



In Nevada, Mississippi, Michigan, and Illinois, amounts owed for markers which are
not timely paid are enforceable under state laws. All other states are required to
enforce a judgment for amounts owed for markers entered into in Nevada, Mississippi,
Illinois or Michigan which are not timely paid, pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit
Clause of the United States Constitution. Amounts owed for markers which are not timely
paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries, but the United States assets
of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.

Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2005, we had approximately 54,500 full-time and 12,000 part-time
employees. At that date, we had collective bargaining contracts with unions covering
approximately 29,000 of our employees. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Regulation and Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay
gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive
regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is
located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility,
financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial
interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result
in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed description of the
regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99 to this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations
in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not
limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental
matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and
marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be
interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted.
Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by
courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.

Forward-looking
Statements

(Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)

This Form 10-K and our 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders contain some
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or
forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do
not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They contain words such as
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “may,”
“could,” “might” and other words or phrases of similar meaning in connection with any
discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
statements relating to future actions, new projects, future performance, the outcome of
contingencies such as legal proceedings and future financial results. From time to
time, we also provide oral or written forward-looking statements in our Forms 10-Q and
8-K, press releases and other materials we release to the public. Any or all of our
forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K, in our 2005 Annual Report to Stockholders
and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be
affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and
uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in this Form 10-K — for example, government
regulation and the competitive environment — will be important in determining our
future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Our
actual future results may differ materially.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised,
however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Forms
10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also note that we
provide the following discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate
assumptions relevant to our business. This discussion is
provided as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

You should also be aware that while we from time to time communicate with
securities analysts, we do not disclose to them any material non-public information,
internal forecasts or other confidential business information. Therefore, you should
not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any analyst,
irrespective of the content of the statement or report. To the extent that reports
issued by securities analysts contain projections, forecasts or opinions, those reports
are not our responsibility.



Factors
that May Affect Our Future Results

You
should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and
elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the SEC could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.
In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things, the risks described below.

We
incorporate by reference the information appearing under
“Factors that May Affect Our Future Results”
in Item 1 of this Form 10-K .

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

None.



ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Our principal executive offices are located at Bellagio. The following table lists
our significant land holdings. Unless otherwise indicated, all properties are
wholly-owned.

Prior to February 2005, substantially all of the Company’s assets other than assets
of its foreign subsidiaries and certain assets in use at MGM Grand Detroit were pledged
as collateral for our senior notes and principal credit facilities. As a result of the
redemption of our 6.875% Senior Notes due February 2008 and the repayment of our 6.95%
senior notes due February 2005, we applied for, and received, release of collateral
under our credit facility and senior notes.

We have contributed approximately 7 acres of land adjacent to MGM Grand Las Vegas
to ventures formed with Turnberry Associates to develop The Signature at MGM Grand. The
land is collateralized by construction financing for Towers 1 and 2 in the amount of up
to $440 million. As of December 31, 2005, $121 million was outstanding under the
construction financing.



Silver Legacy occupies approximately 5 acres in Reno, Nevada, adjacent to Circus
Circus Reno. The site is collateralized by a mortgage securing Silver Legacy’s senior
credit facility and 10.125% mortgage notes. As of December 31, 2005, $160 million of
principal of the 10.125% mortgage notes were outstanding.

Primm Valley Resorts are not served by a municipal water system. We have rights to
water in various wells located on federal land in the vicinity of the Primm Valley
Resorts and have received permits to pipe the water to the Primm Valley Resorts. These
permits and rights are subject to the jurisdiction and ongoing regulatory authority of
the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the States of Nevada and California and local
governmental units. We believe that adequate water for the Primm Valley Resorts is
available; however, we cannot be certain that the future needs will be within the
permitted allowance. Also, we can give no assurance that any future requests for
additional water will be approved or that no further requirements will be imposed by
governmental agencies on our use and delivery of water for the Primm Valley Resorts.

Borgata occupies approximately 46 acres at Renaissance Pointe, including 19 acres
we lease to Borgata. Borgata owns approximately 27 acres which are collateralized by a
mortgage securing bank credit facilities in the amount of up to $750 million. As of
December 31, 2005, $342 million was outstanding under the bank credit facility.

We also own or lease various other improved and unimproved property in Las Vegas
and other locations in the United States and certain foreign countries.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Poulos Slot Machine Litigation

On April 26, 1994, an individual filed a complaint in a class action lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against 41
manufacturers, distributors and casino operators of video poker and electronic slot
machines, including the Company. On May 10, 1994, another plaintiff filed a complaint
in a class action lawsuit alleging substantially the same claims in the same court
against 48 defendants, including the Company. On September 26, 1995, another plaintiff
filed a complaint in a class action lawsuit alleging substantially the same claims in
the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against 45 defendants,
including the Company. The court consolidated the three cases in the United States
District Court for the District of Nevada.

The consolidated complaint claims that we and the other defendants have engaged in
a course of fraudulent and misleading conduct intended to induce people to play video
poker and electronic slot machines based on a false belief concerning how the gaming
machines operate, as well as the chances of winning. Specifically, the plaintiffs
allege that the gaming machines are not truly random as advertised to the public, but
are pre-programmed in a predictable and manipulative manner. The complaint alleges
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, as well as claims
of common law fraud, unjust enrichment and negligent misrepresentation, and asks for
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. In December 1997, the court granted in
part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to
state a claim and ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which they filed
in February 1998. We, along with most of the other defendants, answered the amended
complaint and continue to deny the allegations contained in the amended complaint. The
parties have fully briefed the issues regarding class certification, which are currently
pending before the court.

In June 2002, the U.S. District Court in Nevada ruled that the plaintiffs met
certain prerequisite requirements for class action status, but the court denied the
plaintiffs’ motion for class action certification, on the grounds that the proposed
class lacked the cohesiveness required to settle common claims against the casino
industry. The court had previously stayed discovery pending resolution of these class
certification issues. In August 2004, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the
District Court’s ruling denying class action status for the case. In November 2004, the
District Court set a discovery deadline of April 2005 and trial in September 2005.
After plaintiffs’ dismissal of certain operator and cruise ship defendants, the
remaining defendants in April 2005 filed dispositive motions for summary judgment. In
September 2005, the District Court entered an order granting summary judgment to all
defendants that remained in the case on all of plaintiffs’ claims, dismissed the case in
its entirety and entered judgment in favor of defendants. In
October 2005, plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals of the
judgment granting summary judgment to defendants, and of two prior discovery orders that
had been entered in the case. The appeal remains pending.



Boardwalk Shareholder Litigation

On
September 28, 1999, a former stockholder of our subsidiary which owns and,
until January 2006 operated, the Boardwalk Hotel and Casino filed a first amended complaint in a putative
class action lawsuit in District Court for Clark County, Nevada against Mirage Resorts
and certain former directors and principal stockholders of the Boardwalk subsidiary. The
complaint alleged that Mirage Resorts induced the other defendants to breach their
fiduciary duties to Boardwalk’s minority stockholders by devising and implementing a
scheme by which Mirage Resorts acquired Boardwalk at significantly less than the true
value of its shares. The complaint sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages
from Mirage Resorts and punitive damages from the other defendants, whom we are required
to defend and indemnify.

In June 2000, the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to
state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The plaintiff appealed the ruling to
the Nevada Supreme Court. The parties filed briefs with the Nevada Supreme Court, and
oral arguments were conducted in October 2001. In February 2003, the Nevada Supreme
Court overturned the District Court’s order granting our motion to dismiss the complaint
and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings on the elements of
the lawsuit involving wrongful conduct in approving the merger and/or in the valuation
of the merged corporation’s shares. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the District
Court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims for lost profits and mismanagement. The
Nevada Supreme Court’s ruling relates only to the District Court’s ruling on our motion
to dismiss and is not a determination of the merits of the plaintiff’s case. The
plaintiff filed an amended complaint, and in November 2003, the District Court certified
the action as a class action.

In March 2005, the District Court for Clark County, Nevada granted summary judgment
in our favor. In May 2005 plaintiffs filed an appeal of the dismissal to the Nevada
Supreme Court. At a mediation conference mandated by court rule, the parties reached a
settlement agreement on terms favorable to us, which is in the process of documentation
and is subject to final approval by the Nevada Supreme Court.

Mandalay Resort Group Shareholder Litigation

On April 25, 2005, the Company consummated its acquisition of Mandalay pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of June 15, 2004 (the “Merger Agreement”), among the Company, MGM MIRAGE
Acquisition Co. #61, a Nevada corporation, that was a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company (“Merger Sub”), and Mandalay. The acquisition was effected by merging Merger
Sub with and into Mandalay (the “Merger”), with Mandalay continuing as the surviving
corporation.

In connection with the Merger, Mandalay and its directors were named defendants in

Stephen Ham, Trustee for the J.C. Ham Residuary Trust v. Mandalay Resort Group, et al.

,
which was filed in June 2004 in the 8

th

Judicial District Court for Clark
County, Nevada, and

Robert Lowinger v. Mandalay Resort Group, et al

., which was filed in
June 2004, also in the 8

th

Judicial District Court for Clark County, Nevada.
Both of these actions make claims concerning the Merger, including claims of breach of
fiduciary duty against Mandalay’s directors, and seek injunctive relief and unspecified
monetary damages. The plaintiffs in both actions agreed that Mandalay and the directors
did not need to respond to the pending complaints, as they intended to file a joint
amended complaint and consolidate both actions. In December 2004, the plaintiff in

Ham

filed a motion for temporary restraining order and motion for preliminary injunction
enjoining the Mandalay shareholder vote on the proposed merger and for an order
shortening time to allow plaintiff to conduct expedited discovery. The plaintiff’s
motion was denied. In January 2005, the plaintiff in

Ham

filed an amended complaint for
breach of fiduciary duty in connection with the defendants’ approval of the proposed
merger. Mandalay moved to dismiss the amended complaint in April 2005. In October
2005, the Nevada District Court issued a minute order dismissing the

Ham

case. In November 2005, a formal decision, order and
judgment of dismissal of the case was entered. Plaintiff in the

Lowinger

case has indicated his intention to file a voluntary dismissal of his action,
but the dismissal has not yet been filed. The Company will continue to monitor and
protect its interest in these cases until their final conclusion.

Other

We and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other lawsuits, most of
which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. We do not believe that the
outcome of this other pending litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

There were approximately 3,703 record holders of our common stock as of March
1, 2006.

We have not paid dividends on our common stock in the last two fiscal years. We
intend to retain our earnings to fund the operation of our business, to service and
repay our debt, to make strategic investments in high return growth projects at our
proven resorts, to repurchase shares of common stock and to reserve our capital to raise
our capacity to capture investment opportunities overseas and in emerging domestic
markets. Furthermore, as a holding company with no independent operations, our ability
to pay dividends will depend upon the receipt of dividends and other payments from our
subsidiaries. Our senior credit facility contains financial covenants that could
restrict our ability to pay dividends. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews our
policy with respect to dividends, and any determination to pay dividends in the future
will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.

In June 2003, we ceased operations of PLAYMGMMIRAGE.com, our online gaming website
(“Online”). In January 2004, we sold the Golden Nugget Las Vegas and the Golden Nugget Laughlin
including substantially all of the assets and liabilities of those resorts (the “Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries”). In July 2004, we sold the subsidiaries that owned and operated MGM Grand Australia.
The results of Online, the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries and MGM Grand Australia are classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented. The Mandalay acquisition occurred on April
25, 2005.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Executive Overview

Current Operations

At December 31, 2005, our operations consisted of 24 wholly-owned casino resorts
and 50% investments in three other casino resorts, including:

Las Vegas, Nevada:

Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, The
Mirage, Luxor, TI, New York-New York, Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Circus Circus
Las Vegas, Slots-A-Fun and Boardwalk (Boardwalk closed in January 2006 in
preparation for Project CityCenter – see “Other Factors Affecting Liquidity”).

Other domestic:

The Primm Valley Resorts (Whiskey Pete’s, Buffalo Bill’s
and Primm Valley Resort) in Primm, Nevada; Circus Circus Reno and Silver
Legacy (50% owned) in Reno, Nevada; Colorado Belle and Edgewater in Laughlin,
Nevada; Gold Strike and Nevada Landing in Jean, Nevada; Railroad Pass in
Henderson, Nevada; MGM Grand Detroit; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi and
Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata (50% owned) in Atlantic
City, New Jersey; and Grand Victoria (50% owned) in Elgin, Illinois.

Other operations include the Shadow Creek golf course in North Las Vegas; two golf
courses at Primm Valley; a 50% investment in The Signature at MGM Grand, a
condominium-hotel development adjacent to MGM Grand Las Vegas; and a 50% investment in
MGM Grand Paradise Limited, which is constructing a casino resort in Macau.

Mandalay Acquisition

On April 25, 2005, we closed our merger with Mandalay Resort Group (“Mandalay”)
under which we acquired Mandalay for $71 in cash for each share of common stock of
Mandalay. The total acquisition cost of $7.3 billion included equity value of
approximately $4.8 billion, the assumption or repayment of outstanding Mandalay debt
with a fair value of approximately $2.9 billion and $0.1 billion of transaction costs,
offset by the $0.5 billion received by Mandalay from the sale of its interest in
MotorCity Casino in Detroit, Michigan.

The Mandalay acquisition expands our portfolio of resorts on the Las Vegas Strip,
provides additional sites for future development and expands our employee and customer
bases significantly. These factors result in the recognition of certain intangible
assets and significant goodwill. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and may
be adjusted up to one year after the acquisition. In particular, we are still
evaluating certain customer relationship intangible assets related to individual and
group hotel reservations as well as gaming loyalty program members. We did not incur
any significant employee termination costs or other exit costs in connection with the
Mandalay acquisition.

Key Performance Indicators

We operate primarily in one segment, the operation of casino resorts, which
includes offering gaming, hotel, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort
amenities. Giving effect to the Mandalay merger, over half of our net
revenue is now
derived from non-gaming activities, a higher percentage than many of our competitors, as
our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our guests,
including non-gaming amenities which command a premium price based on their quality. We
believe that we own several of the premier casino resorts in the world, and a main focus
of our strategy is to continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain our competitive
advantage.

As a resort-based company, our operating results are highly dependent on the volume
of customers at our resorts, which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel
rooms and other amenities. We also generate a significant portion of our operating
income from the high-end gaming segment, which can cause variability in our results.
Key performance indicators related to revenue are:

•

Gaming revenue indicators – table games drop and slots handle (volume
indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us.
Our normal table games win percentage is in the range of 18% to 22% of table
games drop and our normal slots win percentage is in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% of
slots handle;

•

Hotel revenue indicators – hotel occupancy (volume indicator); average daily
rate (“ADR”, price indicator); revenue per available room (“REVPAR”), a summary
measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate.



Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers wagering with cash
or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our resorts, like many in
the industry, generate significant operating cash flow. Our industry is capital
intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash
flow to repay debt financing, fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess
cash for future development.

We generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our resorts in
Las Vegas, Nevada, which exposes us to certain risks outside of our control, such as
competition from other recently opened Las Vegas resorts, including several expanded
resorts and a major new competitor, and the impact from expansion of gaming in
California. We are also exposed to risks related to tourism and the general economy,
including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global
events.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of
factors can affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major Las
Vegas conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our
high-end customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and
Chinese New Year. Our results do not depend on key individual customers, though our
success in marketing to customer groups, such as convention customers, or the financial
health of customer groups, such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from
a particular country or region, can impact our results.

Overall Outlook

We have invested heavily in our existing operations in the past three years, and
expect to continue to do so on a targeted basis in 2006. Our Las Vegas Strip resorts
require ongoing capital investment to maintain their competitive advantages. We believe
these investments in additional non-gaming amenities have enhanced our ability to
generate increased visitor volume and allowed us to charge premium prices for our
amenities.

The most likely significant factors affecting operating results at our existing
resorts in 2006 will be the addition of Mandalay, the expected continued positive impact
of our targeted capital improvements, and the completion of Towers 1 and 2 of The
Signature at MGM Grand. The Mandalay acquisition will continue to affect year-over-year
comparisons through April 2006 as a result of the net revenues and operating income of
these resorts, which includes the impact on depreciation and amortization expense of
recognizing depreciable real property and amortizable intangible assets at fair value,
and additional interest expense as a result of financing the merger through borrowings
under our senior credit facility. Additionally, ongoing impacts of cost savings and
revenue enhancements will positively affect earnings throughout 2006.

Some of the capital improvements we made in 2005 were made towards the end of the
year, so 2006 will be the first full year of results including these improvements,
particularly at The Mirage, where the Jet nightclub and several restaurants were added
at or near year-end. In addition, this resort will benefit from the Beatles-themed show
by Cirque du Soleil expected to open in mid-2006. These improvements, along with
improvements at other resorts, are expected to drive continued increases in REVPAR and
increased customer volumes in gaming areas, restaurants, shops, entertainment venues and
our other resort amenities.

Towers 1 and 2 of The Signature at MGM Grand are expected to be completed in the
second and fourth quarters of 2006, respectively. At that time, we will recognize our
share of the venture’s net income, which will consist of the sales and costs associated
with the sales of the condominium units, along with deferred profit from our
contribution of land to the venture, within “income from unconsolidated affiliates” in
the consolidated statement of income. Upon completion of each tower, we will have the
opportunity to rent the condominiums to third parties on behalf of owners who elect to
have us do so, providing a potential ongoing revenue stream.

Financial Statement Impact of Hurricane Katrina

Beau Rivage sustained significant damage in late August 2005 as a result of
Hurricane Katrina and has been closed since. We expect to reopen Beau Rivage in the
third quarter of 2006, although some of the resort’s rooms, restaurants and other
amenities will not reopen until the fourth quarter. The Company maintains insurance
covering both property damage and business interruption as a result of the storm. The
deductible under this coverage is approximately $15 million, based on the amount of
damage incurred. Based on current estimates, insurance proceeds are expected to exceed
the net book value of damaged assets; therefore, the Company will not record an
impairment charge related to the storm and upon ultimate settlement of the claim will
likely record a gain. The damaged assets have been written off and a corresponding
insurance receivable, classified within “Other long-term assets” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, has been recorded.

Business interruption coverage covers lost profits and other costs incurred during
the period of closure and up to six months following the reopening of the facility.
The costs expected to be incurred during the interruption period are less than the
anticipated business interruption proceeds; therefore, post-storm costs are being offset
by the expected recoveries. All post-storm costs and expected recoveries are recorded
net within “General and administrative” expenses in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income, except for depreciation of non-damaged assets, which is classified
as “Depreciation and amortization.”

References to “same-store” results throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis
exclude the Mandalay resorts and Monte Carlo for all periods. Same-store results also

On a consolidated basis, the most important factors and trends contributing to our
performance over the last three years have been:

As a result of the above trends, our net revenues increased 53% in 2005, and 11% on
a same-store basis. Operating margins were relatively flat with 2004 – 21% in 2005
compared to 22% in 2004. The 2004 margin was a significant increase over the 18%
operating margin in 2003. See further discussion of operating income and operating
margins in “Operating Results” below. The increase in income from continuing operations
generally resulted from the increased operating income, offset in part by increased
interest expense, discussed below in “Non-operating Results.”

The 2005 increase in net revenues resulted from the addition of Mandalay and an 11%
increase in same-store net revenues. Same-store net revenues increased largely as a
result of strong room pricing and increased volumes in slots and across all non-gaming
areas. These trends were particularly prominent at Bellagio and MGM Grand Las Vegas as
a result of new and expanded amenities at those resorts.

The 2004 increase in net revenues was largely due to strong room pricing, increased
gaming volumes, and the impact of targeted capital investments in 2003 and 2004 at New
York-New York and MGM Grand Las Vegas.

In 2005, operating income did not increase to the same extent as net revenues,
largely due to already strong operating margins, a lower-than-normal bad debt provision
in 2004, higher corporate expense and higher preopening, restructuring and property
transactions, net. This resulted in an operating margin of 21% versus 22% in 2004.
Corporate expense increased as a percentage of revenue due primarily to merger integration costs.

Our operating income in 2004 increased 36%, due primarily to the strong revenue
trends and a full year of Borgata’s results. The increase in income from unconsolidated
affiliates was responsible for approximately one-third of the increase in operating
income, while improvements at our operating resorts, particularly Bellagio, MGM Grand
Las Vegas and New York-New York, made up the rest of the increase. Operating income at
MGM Grand Detroit was essentially flat in 2004 compared to 2003, despite an increase in
the gaming tax rate from 18% to 24% effective September 2004.

We expect operating margins to stay relatively consistent with current levels in
2006. Anticipated revenue gains at Mandalay resorts and continued realization of merger
cost savings will offset typical increases in labor costs, the additional 2% gaming tax payable to the City of Detroit
beginning January 1, 2006, and the inclusion of stock
compensation expense (see “Recently issued Accounting
Standards”).

Table games revenue, including baccarat, was flat on a same-store basis in 2005. A
4% increase in table games volume was offset by a slightly lower hold percentage, though
hold percentages were within our normal range for all three years presented. In 2004,
table games volume increased 9%, with particular strength in baccarat volume, up 18%.
In both 2005 and 2004, key events such as New Year, Chinese New Year and other marketing
events, were well-attended.

Slots revenue increased 8% on a same-store basis, following a 9% increase in 2004.
Additional volume in 2005 was generated by the Spa Tower at Bellagio — Bellagio’s slots
revenue increased over 30% — and the traffic generated by

KÀ

and other amenities at MGM
Grand Las Vegas, where slots revenue increased almost 10%. In both periods, we benefited
from the continued success of our Players Club affinity program and marketing events
targeted at repeat customers.

Hotel revenue increased 19% on a same-store basis in 2005. We had more rooms
available as a result of the Bellagio expansion and 2004 room remodel activity at MGM
Grand Las Vegas, and our company-wide same-store REVPAR increased 13% to $140. This was
on top of a 10% increase in 2004 over 2003. The increase in REVPAR in 2005 was entirely
rate-driven, as same-store occupancy was consistent at 92%. The 2004 increase was also
largely rate-driven.



Other non-gaming revenue was also up in 2005, with

KÀ

leading to a 35% increase in
same-store entertainment revenue, and several new restaurants and bars at MGM Grand Las
Vegas, Bellagio, TI and The Mirage leading to a 14% increase in same-store food and
beverage revenue. These results followed similar trends experienced in 2004
compared to 2003. We expect these increases to continue in 2006, as we will open a new
Beatles-themed Cirque du Soleil show at The Mirage, along with more new restaurants and
lounges across our resort portfolio, including the recently opened Jet nightclub and
several restaurants at The Mirage.

operating results of that venture prior to its opening. Preopening and start-up
expenses related to Borgata represent our share of the operating results of Borgata
prior to its July 2003 opening. We expect preopening and start-up expenses for Project
CityCenter and MGM Grand Macau to increase in 2006. In addition, we will incur
preopening and start-up expenses related to the permanent facility at MGM Grand Detroit
and the new Beatles-themed show by Cirque du Soleil at The Mirage.

There were no material restructuring activities in 2005. At December 31, 2005,
there were no material restructuring accruals. All material restructuring costs have
been fully paid or otherwise resolved.

In 2004, restructuring costs include $3 million for contract termination costs
related to the Aqua restaurant at Bellagio and $2 million of workforce reduction costs
at MGM Grand Detroit as a result of our efforts to minimize the impact of a gaming tax
increase in Michigan.

In 2003, restructuring costs included $2 million related to the closure of the
Siegfried & Roy show, primarily for severance costs of employees involved in the show’s
production. Also, we terminated a restaurant lease and closed two marketing offices,
resulting in $4 million of contract termination charges. Other severance of $1 million
in 2003 related primarily to restructuring of table games staffing at several resorts.

In 2005, recognized impairments relate primarily to assets removed from service in
connection with new capital projects at several resorts, including Bellagio, TI, The
Mirage and Mandalay Bay. The amount of the impairments was based on the net book value
of the disposed assets. Abandoned projects included individually insignificant projects
at several resorts. Demolition costs related primarily to room remodel activity at MGM
Grand Las Vegas and the new showroom at The Mirage.

In 2004, there were no material unusual property transactions. In 2003, we sold
315 acres of land in North Las Vegas, Nevada near Shadow Creek for approximately $55
million, resulting in the $37 million gain reflected above. Also in 2003, we recorded
write-downs and impairments of assets abandoned or replaced with new construction,
primarily at MGM Grand Las Vegas in preparation for new restaurants and the

theatre.
Demolition costs in 2004 and 2003 related primarily to preparation for the Bellagio

Interest cost was higher in 2005 due to the funding of the cash consideration in
the Mandalay acquisition through senior credit facility borrowings, and the assumption
of debt in the Mandalay acquisition. While variable market interest rates continued to
increase in 2005, our effective interest rate decreased due to a more normalized ratio
of variable rate debt in 2005; our variable interest rate under our senior credit
facility has been lower than the interest rates on our fixed-rate borrowings.
Capitalized interest increased in 2005 as we began capitalizing interest on Project
CityCenter and our investment in MGM Grand Paradise Limited. We expect capitalized interest to
increase in 2006 as we will start capitalizing interest on a longer portion of the land related
to Project City Center and as we spend more on the construction of Project CityCenter.

Interest cost was higher in 2004 as we had a higher average borrowing rate due to
increases in variable interest rates and the issuance of significant fixed rate debt in
the second half of 2004 in anticipation of the Mandalay merger. Capitalized interest
increased in 2004 due to the ongoing Bellagio expansion and

KÀ

theatre projects offset
partially by the cessation of interest capitalization on our investment in Borgata in
July 2003.

Non-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates, primarily our share of interest
expense at Borgata and Silver Legacy and state income taxes at Borgata, increased from
$12 million in 2004 to $16 million in 2005. Borgata’s
lower interest expense was largely offset by the addition of Silver
Legacy’s interest expense, and the remaining decrease resulted from a reduction in state income taxes in
the fourth quarter of 2004 at Borgata as a result of recording the benefit of
certain investment tax credits. In 2004, non-operating items from unconsolidated
affiliates was higher than 2003, $12 million versus $10 million, due to the full year of
Borgata’s results, offset by the reduction to state income taxes in the fourth quarter
of 2004 described above.

The effective income tax rate in 2005 was lower than in 2004 due primarily to a tax
benefit realized from the repatriation of foreign earnings from Australia as a result of
the provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 that provided for a special
one-time deduction of 85 percent on certain repatriated earnings of foreign
subsidiaries. Additionally, in 2004 the Company accrued additional state deferred taxes
related to capital investments in New Jersey and incurred non-deductible costs related
to a Michigan ballot initiative; neither of these items recurred in 2005.



The effective income tax rate in 2004 was higher than in 2003 primarily due to the
additional New Jersey taxes and non-deductible Michigan ballot initiative costs
discussed above, as well as overseas development costs for which no tax benefit was
provided and the reversal of a greater amount of tax reserves in 2003 compared to 2004
as a result of completion of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations.

In 2005, taxes paid decreased from 2004, in part due to increased tax benefits from
stock option exercises and one-time benefit plan deductions, partially offset by
decreased accelerated tax depreciation deductions and increased pre-tax income. In
addition, a federal tax overpayment from 2004 was applied to 2005, reducing the 2005 tax
payments. In 2004, taxes paid increased from 2003, primarily due to increased pre-tax
income and the full utilization of tax credit carryforwards in 2003. We expect cash
paid for income taxes to increase significantly in 2006 due to the required payment of
taxes on the gain on Mandalay’s sale of MotorCity Casino, required tax payments on the
income associated with Towers 1 and 2 of The Signature at MGM Grand, and continued
increases in income resulting from the Mandalay merger and continued improvements in
operating results.

Cash Flows – Operating Activities

Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income,
excluding non-cash charges, since our business is primarily cash-based. Cash flow from
operations has increased in each of the last two years due to higher operating income
offset by higher combined interest and tax payments.

At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we held cash and cash equivalents of $378 million
and $435 million, respectively. We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate
our resorts. Beyond our cash on hand, we utilize a company-wide cash management system
to minimize the amount of cash held in banks. Funds are swept from accounts at our
resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are
used to repay borrowings under our bank credit facilities. Included in cash and cash
equivalents at December 31, 2004 was $141 million received from the sale of MGM Grand
Australia and still held in Australia. These funds, net of amounts paid for Australia taxes on the sale, were repatriated to the United
States in 2005 and used to fund capital expenditures during the year.



Cash Flows – Investing Activities

The acquisition of Mandalay closed on April 25, 2005, at a cost of $4.4 billion,
net of cash acquired, plus the assumption of $2.9 billion of Mandalay debt.

Capital expenditures in 2005 included maintenance capital spending at our resorts —
such as room remodel activity at MGM Grand Las Vegas, including the completion of the
Skylofts and West Wing room enhancements — and spending on the following key expansion
and development projects:

•

Project CityCenter;

•

The permanent casino at MGM Grand Detroit, including costs of purchasing land;

•

The new theatre at The Mirage for the Beatles-themed show by Cirque du Soleil,
along with new restaurants and other amenities at this resort;

•

Rebuilding costs at Beau Rivage.

Capital expenditures in 2004 consisted of large capital projects, such as the Bellagio
expansion and the

KÀ

theatre at MGM Grand Las Vegas, and maintenance capital activities,
such as room remodel projects at New York – New York and MGM Grand Las Vegas and new
restaurant and entertainment amenities at several resorts. Capital expenditures in 2003
included major projects at our existing resorts, including projects described above
which began in 2003, the

Zumanity

theatre at New York-New York, the Bellagio room
remodel and slot technology improvements.

The sale of the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries closed in January 2004 with net proceeds
to the Company of $210 million. The sale of MGM Grand Australia closed in July 2004
with net proceeds to the Company of $136 million.

Investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2005 consists primarily of our required
contributions to MGM Grand Paradise Limited, which is developing MGM Grand Macau. In 2004, such investments related
primarily to The Signature at MGM Grand, and in 2003 such investments related primarily
to Borgata.

Cash Flows – Financing Activities

Our primary financing activities in 2005 related to the Mandalay acquisition. The
cash purchase price of Mandalay, $4.4 billion, was funded from borrowings under our
senior credit facility. We also issued $875 million of fixed rate debt in various
issuances:

•

In June 2005, we issued $500 million of 6.625% senior notes due 2015;

•

In September 2005, we issued $375 million of 6.625% senior notes due 2015.

In the first quarter of 2005, we repaid at their scheduled maturity two issues of
senior notes due in 2005, $176.4 million of 6.625% senior notes and $300 million of
6.95% senior notes, and redeemed one issue of senior notes due in 2008, $200 million of
6.875% senior notes. The redemption of the 2008 senior notes resulted in a loss on
early retirement of debt of $20 million, which is classified as “Other, net” in the
accompanying consolidated statements of income. With the redemption of the 2008 senior
notes and the repayment of the 6.95% senior notes, the Company’s senior credit facility
and senior notes are now unsecured.

In addition, in the second quarter of 2005 we initiated a tender offer for several
issuances of Mandalay’s senior notes and senior subordinated notes totaling $1.5
billion. Holders of $155 million of Mandalay’s senior notes and senior subordinated
notes redeemed their holdings. Holders of Mandalay’s floating rate convertible senior
debentures with a principal amount of $394 million had the right to redeem the
debentures for $566 million through June 30, 2005. $388 million of principal of the
convertible debentures were tendered for redemption and redeemed for $558 million.
Since the Mandalay acquisition we have reduced net debt by $419 million.

In 2004, we issued $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt in various issuances:

•

In February and March 2004, we issued $525 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2014;

•

In August 2004, we issued $550 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2012;

•

In September 2004, we issued $450 million of 6% senior notes due 2009 at a premium to yield 5.65%.



In 2004, we repaid a net $1.6 billion on our bank credit facilities and repurchased
$49 million of our existing senior notes for $52 million, resulting in a loss on early
retirement of debt of $6 million, including the write-off of unamortized original issue
discount, which is classified as “Other, net” in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.

In 2003, we issued $600 million of 6% senior notes, due 2009 and repaid a net $285
million on our bank credit facilities. The net proceeds of these financing activities
were used to supplement operating cash flows, fund capital expenditures and repurchase
shares of our common stock.

Our share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase programs approved by our
Board of Directors and publicly announced. Our share repurchase activity was as

proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options in the years ended December 31,
2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Principal Debt Arrangements

Our long-term debt consists of publicly held senior and subordinated notes and our
senior credit facility. We pay fixed rates of interest ranging from 5.875% to 10.25% on
the senior and subordinated notes. We pay variable interest based on LIBOR on our
senior credit facility. Our current senior credit facility is a $7.0 billion, five-year
credit facility with a syndicate of banks led by Bank of America, N.A., and consists of
a $5.5 billion revolving credit facility and a $1.5 billion term loan facility. As of
December 31, 2005, we had approximately $2.2 billion of available liquidity under our
senior credit facility.

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity

Distributions from The Signature at MGM Grand

.

As discussed earlier,
Towers 1 and 2 of The Signature at MGM Grand are expected to be completed in the second
and fourth quarters of 2006, respectively. We expect to receive
distributions totaling at least $100
million upon completion
of these towers.

Long-term Debt Payable in 2006

.

We repaid $200 million of long-term debt
at maturity in February 2006 with available borrowings under our senior credit facility.
Another $245 million of long-term debt matures later in 2006.

Project CityCenter

.

In November 2004 we announced a plan to develop a
multi-billion dollar urban metropolis, Project CityCenter, on 66 acres of land on the
Las Vegas Strip, between Bellagio and Monte Carlo. Project CityCenter will feature a
4,000-room casino resort designed by world-famous architect Cesar Pelli; two 400-room
boutique hotels, one of which will be managed by luxury hotelier Mandarin Oriental;
approximately 470,000 square feet of retail shops, dining and entertainment venues; and
approximately 2.3 million square feet of residential space in over 2,900 luxury
condominium and condominium-hotel units in multiple towers.

As currently contemplated, we believe Project CityCenter will cost approximately $7
billion, excluding preopening and land costs. After estimated proceeds of $2.5 billion
from the sale of residential units, we believe the net project cost will be
approximately $4.5 billion. We expect to complete the design work for Project
CityCenter in mid-2006 and expect the project to open in 2009. The design, budget and
schedule of Project CityCenter are still preliminary, and the ultimate timing, cost and
scope of Project CityCenter are subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects.



Detroit Permanent Casino

. MGM Grand Detroit, LLC has operated an interim
casino facility in downtown Detroit since July 1999. In August 2002 the Detroit City
Council approved revised development agreements with our subsidiary and two other
developers. The revised development agreement released us and the City from certain of
the obligations under the original agreement and significantly changed other provisions
of the original agreement.

In April 2005, the 6

th

Circuit Court of Appeals lifted its injunction
prohibiting commencement of construction of the permanent hotel and casino complexes. We
have obtained land and began construction on our permanent facility, which will be
located near the site of our interim facility. The permanent facility is expected to
open in late 2007 at a cost of $765 million, including land and preopening costs, and
will feature a 400-room hotel, 100,000-square foot casino, numerous restaurant and
entertainment amenities, and spa and convention facilities. The complete design, timing
and cost of the permanent facility are at a preliminary stage, and are subject to risks
attendant to large-scale projects.

MGM Grand Macau

. We own 50% of MGM Grand Paradise Limited, an entity which
is developing, and will operate, MGM Grand Macau, a hotel-casino resort in Macau S.A.R.
Pansy Ho Chiu-king owns the other 50% of MGM Grand Paradise Limited. MGM Grand Macau
will be located on a prime waterfront site and will feature at least 345 table games and
1,035 slots with room for significant expansion. Other features will include a 600-room
hotel, a luxurious spa, convertible convention space, a
variety of dining destinations, and other attractions. Construction of MGM Grand Macau, which is estimated to
cost $1.1 billion including license and land rights and preopening costs, began in the second quarter of 2005 and the resort is anticipated to
open in late 2007. The complete design, timing, cost and scope of the
project are at a preliminary stage and are subject to the risks attendant to large-scale
projects. We have invested $180 million in the venture, and are committed to loaning
the venture up to $100 million. The venture has obtained commitments from lenders for a
credit facility sufficient, along with equity contributions and shareholder loans, to
fund the construction of MGM Grand Macau.

Beau Rivage Rebuilding

. We have already begun the process of rebuilding
Beau Rivage. Damage was extensive on the main levels of the resort, largely destroying
the casino floor and gaming equipment, the resort’s restaurants, the retail area and a
portion of the parking garage. There was also damage, though to a lesser extent,
in the hotel tower. We expect to reopen the resort in stages beginning in the third quarter of 2006. When fully
reopened, Beau Rivage will include 1,740 guestrooms, over 2,000 slot machines and 90
table games, new and restored restaurants, a state-of-the-art convention center, and
pool and spa amenities.

We believe that a large portion of the costs to rebuild Beau Rivage will be covered
under our insurance policies. However, we cannot determine the exact amount of
reimbursement until we submit our claims and receive notice of approval from our
insurers. It is also uncertain as to the timing of such reimbursements, and we have
been funding the rebuilding costs in advance of receiving reimbursements from our
insurers.

New York Racing Association

. We have entered into a definitive agreement
with the New York Racing Association (“NYRA”) to manage video lottery terminals (“VLTs”)
at NYRA’s Aqueduct horseracing facility in metropolitan New York. We will assist in the
development of the approximately $170 million facility, including providing project
financing, and will manage the facility for a term of five years (extended automatically
if the financing provided by us is not fully repaid) for a fee. Recent legislative
changes will allow us to operate the VLTs past the expiration date of the current
NYRA franchise agreement.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in
unconsolidated affiliates, which currently consist primarily of our investments in
Borgata, Grand Victoria, Silver Legacy, MGM Grand Macau and The Signature at MGM Grand.
We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we
engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate swaps.
Our joint venture and unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us to realize the
benefits of owning a full-scale resort in a manner that minimizes our initial
investment. We provided a guaranty for up to 50% of the interest and principal payment
obligations on the construction financing for the first two towers of The Signature at
MGM Grand. Otherwise, we have not guaranteed financing obtained by our investees, nor
are there any other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us
to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort.

At December 31, 2005, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $53 million, of
which $50 million support bonds issued by the Economic Development Corporation of the
City of Detroit. These bonds are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance
sheets. This obligation was undertaken to secure our right to develop a permanent
casino in Detroit.

Includes our obligation to support $50 million of bonds issued by the Economic
Development Corporation of the City of Detroit as part of our development agreement
with the City. The bonds mature in 2009. Also includes the estimated payments of
obligations under our deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement
plans, based on balances as of December 31, 2005 and assumptions of retirement based
on plan provisions.

(3)

Included in construction commitments is $413 million related to Project
CityCenter, consisting primarily of commitments related to design work and the
Bellagio employee parking garage. While we have entered into a contract with a
general contractor for the construction of most of Project CityCenter, we are not
committed to any component of the project until we request and approve a guaranteed
maximum price (“GMP”) for the component with the general contractor. We expect to
approve GMPs for most or all of the components of Project CityCenter in 2006.

(4)

Our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments
to Cirque du Soleil, which performs shows at several of our resorts. We are
generally contractually committed for a period of 12 months based on our ability to
exercise certain termination rights; however, we expect these shows to continue for
longer periods.

(5)

The amount for 2006 includes approximately $61 million of open purchase
orders. Other commitments are for various contracts, including corporate aircraft
purchases, maintenance and other service agreements and advertising commitments.

Summary of Expected Sources and Uses of Funds

In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, other significant
operating uses of cash in 2006 include tax payments. Other significant investing uses
of cash flow in 2006 include uncommitted capital expenditures, expected to be
approximately $850 million, excluding capitalized interest and spending at Beau Rivage.

We plan to fund our contractual obligations and other estimated spending through a
combination of operating cash flow, distributions from The Signature at MGM Grand,
available borrowings under our senior credit facility and potential issuances of fixed
rate long-term debt. We generated almost $1.2 billion in operating cash flow in 2005,
which included deductions for interest payments, tax payments and certain contractually
committed payments reflected in the above table, including operating leases, employment
agreements and entertainment agreements. We expect to generate a higher level of
operating cash flow in 2006 due primarily to the continued impact of the Mandalay
acquisition, as well as expected increases in operating income at other resorts.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and
capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly
evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be
critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have
a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed the
disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed
the processes to determine those estimates.



Allowance for Doubtful Casino Accounts Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Bellagio,
MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize
marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos
as well.

We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue
collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These
collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing
with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency
notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation.
Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States. At
December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately 44% and 54%, respectively, of our casino
accounts receivable was owed by customers from the United States. Markers are not
legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets
of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.
At December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately 42% and 25%, respectively, of our casino
accounts receivable was owed by customers from the Far East.

We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our
operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense,
increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowance for
doubtful casino accounts. At resorts where marker play is not significant, the
allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged
account balances. At resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard
reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and
specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the
specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial
condition, collection history and any other known information. We also monitor regional
and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are
adequate.

The collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors, including
changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home
countries. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the
allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information
about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables:

The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable
has decreased in the last two years, particularly in 2004, as a result of improved
collections leading to improved credit statistics. Our reserve percentages for 2004 and
2005 are consistent with the percentage before the September 11, 2001 attacks, and are
representative of a more normalized collection experience and positive global economic
conditions relative to the conditions in 2001 and 2002.

At December 31, 2005, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful
accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by $1.5
million, or less than $0.01 per share.

Fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies

Property and equipment are stated at cost. For the majority of our property and
equipment, cost has been determined based on estimated fair values in connection with
the Mandalay acquisition and the May 2000 Mirage Resorts acquisition. Maintenance and
repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong
its life are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We account for
construction projects in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects.” When
we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to
architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and
construction subsidiaries.



We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures.
Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a
matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether
existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of
judgment. Our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about
our assets’ estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on
our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage
of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful
life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34,
“Capitalization of Interest Cost” (“SFAS 34”), interest cost associated with major
development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project.
Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the
weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings, since we typically do not borrow
funds directly related to a development project. Capitalization of interest starts when
construction activities, as defined in SFAS 34, begin and ceases when construction is
substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief
period.

Whether we capitalize interest on a project depends in part on management’s
actions. In November 2004, we announced the development of Project CityCenter in Las
Vegas. In connection with this announcement and the start of design activities, we
began capitalizing interest associated with this project, including capitalizing
interest on land costs for the portion of the Project CityCenter site not currently
being utilized in operations. Interest capitalized on this project for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2005 was $2 million and $12 million, respectively.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For assets to be disposed of, we
recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of
disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted
cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever
indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the
asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the
undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the
undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded
based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow
model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining
construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be disposed
of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of
long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the asset. To the
extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an
impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and
management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates
are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our
estimates.

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events
have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. We estimate
future cash flows using our internal budgets. When appropriate, we discount future cash
flows using our weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital
asset pricing model. Whenever an impairment loss is recorded, or a test for impairment
is made, we discuss the facts and circumstances with the Audit Committee.

See “Results of Operations” for discussion of write-downs and impairments recorded
in 2003, 2004 and 2005. In June 2003, we entered into an agreement to sell the Golden
Nugget Subsidiaries. The fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value,
therefore no impairment was indicated. In February 2004, we entered into an agreement
to sell MGM Grand Australia. The fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying
value, therefore no impairment was indicated. Other than the above items, we are not
aware of events or circumstances that would cause us to review any material long-lived
assets for impairment.

Income taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States, and in several states and
foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We account for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of
applicable reserves, related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary
differences. The standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent
that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation
allowance is applied.



As reflected in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, at
December 31, 2005, we had $126 million of deferred tax assets and $3.4 billion of
deferred tax liabilities. Except for certain New Jersey state net operating losses,
certain other New Jersey state deferred tax assets and certain foreign deferred tax
assets, we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets are
fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary
differences and future projected taxable income. The valuation allowance at December
31, 2005 related to the New Jersey and foreign deferred tax assets were $6 million and
$2 million, respectively.

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) and other tax authorities. While positions taken in tax returns are sometimes
subject to uncertainty in the tax laws, we do not take such positions unless we have
“substantial authority” to do so under the Internal Revenue Code and applicable
regulations. We may take positions on our tax returns based on substantial authority
that are not ultimately accepted by the IRS.

We assess such potential unfavorable outcomes based on the criteria of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“SFAS 5”). We
establish a tax reserve if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the
unfavorable outcome can be reasonably estimated. We assess the potential outcomes of
tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis. In determining whether the probable criterion
of SFAS 5 is met, we presume that the taxing authority will focus on the exposure and we
assess the probable outcome of a particular issue based upon the relevant legal and
technical merits. We also apply our judgment regarding the potential actions by the tax
authorities and resolution through the settlement process.

We maintain required tax reserves until such time as the underlying issue is
resolved. When actual results differ from reserve estimates, we adjust the income tax
provision and our tax reserves in the period resolved. For tax years that are examined
by taxing authorities, we adjust tax reserves in the year the tax examinations are
settled. For tax years that are not examined by taxing authorities, we adjust tax
reserves in the year that the statute of limitations expires. Our estimate of the
potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental, and we believe we
have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to
uncertain tax matters.

During 2003, we filed amended returns for tax years subsequent to 1996 to reflect
the impact of the IRS audits of the 1993 through 1996 tax years on those subsequent
years. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the statutes of limitations expired for the 1997
through 1999 tax years, resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of $13 million and
a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes. In the third quarter of
2004, the statute of limitations expired for our 2000 tax return, resulting in a
reduction of our tax reserves of $6 million and a corresponding reduction in our
provision for income taxes. The IRS is currently auditing our 2001 and 2002 tax
returns, and the tax returns for years after 2002 are subject to possible future
examination.

We classify reserves for tax uncertainties within “Other accrued liabilities” in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, separate from any related income tax
payable or deferred income taxes. Reserve amounts may relate to the deductibility of an
item, as well as potential interest associated with those items.

A portion of our tax reserves was assumed in the Mirage Resorts and Mandalay
acquisitions. The IRS audit of the tax returns of Mirage Resorts through the merger date was
settled in August 2003, resulting in a payment to the IRS of $45 million, including
interest. These matters had been previously reserved for, so the settlement had no
impact on our goodwill balances. Any future adjustments to the acquired Mirage Resorts
and Mandalay tax reserves will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill.

Business Combinations

We account for business combinations in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No, 141, “Accounting for Business Combinations” (“SFAS
141”) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
“Accounting tor Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets”
(“SFAS 142”), and related interpretations. SFAS 141 requires that
we record the net assets of acquired businesses at fair value, and we must make estimates
and assumptions to determine the fair value of these acquired assets and assumed liabilities.

In determining the fair value of
acquired assets and assumed liabilities in the Mandalay acquisition, we
hired third-party valuation specialists to assist us with certain fair value estimates,
primarily related to land, property and equipment and intangible assets. We and the third-party specialist
applied significant judgment and utilized a variety of assumptions in determining the fair value of acquired assets
and assumed liabilities, including market data, estimated future cash flows, growth rates, current
replacement cost for similar capacity for certain fixed assets, market rate assumptions for contractual
obligations and settlement plans for contingencies and liabilities.



The Mandalay purchase price allocation
is preliminary and may be adjusted up to one year after the acquisition. In particular, the
Company is still evaluating certain customer relationship intangible assets
related to individual and group hotel reservations as well as gaming loyalty program members.
Changes to the assumptions we used to estimate fair value could impact the recorded amounts for
acquired assets and assumed liabilities and significant changes to these balances could have a
material impact to our future
reported results. For instance, lower or higher fair values assigned to property, plant, and
equipment and
certain amortizable intangible assets could result in lower or higher amounts of depreciation and
 amortization recorded.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Stock-based Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”). Under the original standard, SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), companies had the option of
recording stock options issued to employees at fair value or intrinsic value, which
generally leads to no expense being recorded. Most companies, including us, opted to
use this intrinsic value method and make required disclosures of fair value expense.
SFAS 123(R) eliminates this intrinsic value alternative. SFAS 123(R) was effective for
us on January 1, 2006, and all future share-based payments must be recorded at
fair value. The following are the key impacts and decisions regarding implementation of
SFAS 123(R).

Valuation model

. Under SFAS 123, stock options were generally valued using
the Black-Scholes model. SFAS 123(R) does not specify which model must be used, but
requires that certain assumptions be included in the chosen model, which may be a closed
form model, such as the Black-Scholes model, or a binomial model. We have chosen to
continue applying the Black-Scholes model.

Vesting patterns

. Under SFAS 123(R), awards with graded vesting, as all of
our awards have, may be expensed in one of two time patterns: 1) On a straight-line
basis over the complete vesting period, as though the entire award was one grant; or 2)
On an accelerated basis, treating each vesting layer as a separate grant and amortizing
each layer on a straight-line basis. For disclosure purposes under SFAS 123, we used
the accelerated basis. We will use the straight-line method for future grants under
SFAS 123(R). As discussed below under transition methods, such policy will only apply
to future grants. Expense recognized under SFAS 123(R) for previously granted options
will continue to be recorded on the accelerated basis.

Estimating forfeitures

. Under SFAS 123, we could choose whether to
estimate forfeitures at the grant date or recognize actual forfeitures as they occur.
Under SFAS 123(R), we must estimate forfeitures as of the grant date.

Presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows

. Under
SFAS 123(R), the excess of tax benefits realized from the exercise of employee stock
options over the tax benefit associated with the financial reporting expense is shown as
a financing cash inflow in the statement of cash flows. Previously, these excess
benefits were shown as an operating cash inflow.

Transition

. There are two allowable transition alternatives – the
modified-prospective transition or the modified-retrospective transition. We will apply
the modified-prospective transition. Under the modified-prospective transition, we will
begin applying the valuation and other criteria to stock options granted beginning
January 1, 2006. We will begin recognizing expense for the unvested portion of
previously issued grants at the same time, based on the valuation and attribution
methods originally used to calculate the disclosures.

The impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) on our operating results will depend in part on
the amount of stock options or other share-based payments we grant in the future. The
following table shows compensation expense, net of tax, related to options granted
through December 31, 2005, based on the options’ vesting schedules:

(In thousands)

2003 (Actual, included in our pro forma disclosures)

$

43,310

2004 (Actual, included in our pro forma disclosures)

22,963

2005 (Actual, included in our pro forma disclosures)

47,934

2006 (Estimated, to be recorded as expense)

45,595

We do not believe the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have a material impact on our
cash flows or financial position.

Rental costs incurred during a construction period

In
October 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board  issued Staff Position FAS 13-1, “Accounting for
Rental Costs Incurred during a Construction Period” (“FSP FAS 13-1”). FSP FAS 13-1
requires that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases incurred
during a construction period be expensed. Prevalent practice in real estate and
hospitality industries had been to capitalize such rental costs during a construction
period as a project cost.



FSP FAS 13-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, with
early adoption permitted. We will adopt FSP FAS 13-1 in the first quarter of 2006. We
do not believe that the adoption of FSP FAS 13-1 will have a material impact on our cash
flows or financial position. We have historically not had significant leases during
construction. We will have some minor leases in connection with Project CityCenter, and
MGM Grand Paradise Limited will have a land lease for the project site in Macau.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and
prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long-term
debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our
long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit
facilities.

As of December 31, 2005, long-term fixed rate borrowings represented approximately
61% of our total borrowings. Based on December 31, 2005 debt levels, an assumed 100
basis-point change in LIBOR would cause our annual interest cost to change by
approximately $48 million.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management’s Responsibilities

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting for MGM MIRAGE and subsidiaries (the “Company”).

Objective of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In establishing adequate internal control over financial reporting, management has
developed and maintained a system of internal control, policies and procedures designed
to provide reasonable assurance that information contained in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this annual report
is reliable, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact, and fairly presents in all material respects the financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented
in this annual report. Significant elements of the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting include, for example:

Management’s Evaluation

Management has evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
using the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As
permitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
management’s evaluation as of December 31, 2005 excludes
Mandalay Resort Group (“Mandalay”) and the business units
acquired in the merger with Mandalay which closed on April 25, 2005. Such
businesses represent approximately 47% of the Company’s total
assets as of December 31, 2005 and 29% of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. Based on its
evaluation as of December 31, 2005, management believes that the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting, excluding Mandalay, is effective in achieving the objectives described
above.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Deloitte & Touche LLP audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of
and for the period ended December 31, 2005 and issued their report thereon, which is
included in this annual report. Deloitte & Touche LLP has also issued an attestation
report on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting, excluding Mandalay, and such report is also included in this annual
report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM MIRAGE

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying “Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” that MGM MIRAGE and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. As described in “Management’s Annual Report
on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting,” management excluded
from their assessment the internal control over financial reporting
of Mandalay Resort Group (“Mandalay”) and the business
units acquired in the merger which closed on April 25, 2005. Such
businesses represent approximately 47% of the Company’s total
assets as of December 31, 2005 and 29% of the Company’s total
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2005. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of Mandalay  and the business units acquired in the merger. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board
of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2005 of the
Company and our report dated March 10, 2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and financial statement schedule.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM MIRAGE

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM MIRAGE and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included
in Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2005 and
2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 10,
2006 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of
the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

MGM MIRAGE AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION

MGM
MIRAGE (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation, incorporated on January 29,
1986. As of December 31, 2005, approximately 56% of the outstanding shares of the
Company’s common stock were owned by Tracinda Corporation, a Nevada corporation wholly
owned by Kirk Kerkorian. MGM MIRAGE acts largely as a holding company and, through
wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns and/or operates casino resorts. On April 25, 2005, the
Company completed its merger with Mandalay Resort Group
(“Mandalay”) — see Note 3.

The Company owns and operates the following casino resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada:
Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, Luxor, Treasure Island (“TI”),
New York-New York, Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Circus Circus Las Vegas and Slots-A-Fun. The
Boardwalk was closed in early 2006 in preparation for Project CityCenter (see below).
The Company owns three resorts in Primm, Nevada, at the California/Nevada state line –
Whiskey Pete’s, Buffalo Bill’s and the Primm Valley Resort – as well as two championship
golf courses located near the resorts. Other Nevada operations include Circus Circus
Reno, Colorado Belle and Edgewater in Laughlin, Gold Strike and Nevada Landing in Jean,
and Railroad Pass in Henderson. The Company has a 50% investment in Silver Legacy in
Reno, which is adjacent to Circus Circus Reno. In addition, the Company owns a 50%
interest in The Signature at MGM Grand, which is adjacent to MGM Grand Las Vegas. The
Signature at MGM Grand is a condominium-hotel development, with three towers currently
under construction. The Company also owns Shadow Creek, an exclusive world-class golf
course located approximately ten miles north of its Las Vegas Strip resorts.

The Company and its local partners own MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, which operates a
casino in an interim facility located in downtown Detroit, Michigan. The Company also
owns and operates two resorts in Mississippi – Beau Rivage in Biloxi and Gold Strike
Tunica. Beau Rivage sustained significant damage in late August 2005 as a result of
Hurricane Katrina and has been closed since. The Company expects to reopen Beau Rivage
in stages beginning in the third quarter of 2006. The Company has 50% interests in two resorts outside of
Nevada – Borgata and Grand Victoria. Borgata is a casino resort located on Renaissance
Point in the Marina area of Atlantic City, New Jersey. Boyd Gaming Corporation owns the
other 50% of Borgata and also operates the resort. The Company owns additional land
adjacent to Borgata, a portion of which consists of common roads, landscaping and master
plan improvements, a portion of which is being utilized for an expansion of Borgata, and
a portion of which is available for future development. Grand Victoria is a riverboat in
Elgin, Illinois that was previously owned by Mandalay. An affiliate of Hyatt Gaming owns
the other 50% of Grand Victoria and also operates the resort.

The Company owns 50% of MGM Grand Paradise Limited, a joint venture with Pansy Ho
Chiu-king formed to develop, build and operate a hotel-casino resort, MGM Grand Macau, in
Macau S.A.R. In April 2005, MGM Grand Paradise Limited obtained a subconcession allowing
it to conduct gaming operations. Construction of MGM Grand Macau, which is estimated to
cost approximately $1.1 billion including land and license
rights and preopening costs, began in the second quarter of 2005 and the resort is
anticipated to open in late 2007.

The Company owns 66 acres adjacent to Bellagio on which it is developing Project
CityCenter. Project CityCenter will feature a 4,000-room casino resort designed by
world-famous architect Cesar Pelli; two 400-room non-gaming boutique hotels, one of which
will be managed by luxury hotelier Mandarin Oriental; approximately 470,000 square feet
of retail shops, dining and entertainment venues; and approximately 2.3 million square
feet of residential space in over 2,900 luxury condominium and
condominium-hotel units in
multiple towers. The overall cost of Project CityCenter is estimated at approximately $7
billion, excluding preopening and land costs. After estimated proceeds of $2.5 billion
from the sale of residential units, net project cost is estimated at approximately $4.5
billion. Project City Center is expected to open in 2009.

Until July 2004, the Company owned and operated MGM Grand Australia and until
January 2004, the Company owned and operated the Golden Nugget Las Vegas in downtown Las
Vegas and the Golden Nugget Laughlin in Laughlin, Nevada. Until June 2003, the Company operated PLAYMGMMIRAGE.com, the Company’s
online gaming website based in the Isle of Man. See Note 4 for further information
regarding these discontinued operations.

Until
2005, the Company held an indirect interest in Triangle Casino in
Bristol through its 25% ownership of Metro Casinos Limited, a United
Kingdom gaming company. Metro Casinos Limited sold the Triangle
Casino in 2005.



NOTE 2 — SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Principles of consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates
which are 50% or less owned are accounted for under the equity method. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
Company’s operations are primarily in one segment – operation of casino resorts. Other
operations, and foreign operations, are not material.

Management’s use of estimates.

The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Those principles require the Company’s management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Financial statement impact of Hurricane Katrina

. The Company maintains insurance
covering both property damage and business interruption as a result of wind and flood
damage sustained at Beau Rivage. The deductible under this coverage is approximately
$15 million, based on the amount of damage incurred. Based on current estimates,
insurance proceeds are expected to exceed the net book value of damaged assets;
therefore, the Company will not record an impairment charge related to the storm and
upon ultimate settlement of the claim will likely record a gain. Damaged assets with a
net book value of $121 million have been written off, and a corresponding insurance
receivable has been recorded.

Business interruption coverage covers lost profits and other costs incurred during
the closure period and up to six months following the reopening of the facility.
Expected costs during the interruption period are less than the anticipated business
interruption proceeds; therefore, post-storm costs of $50 million through December 31,
2005 were offset by the expected recoveries and a corresponding insurance receivable was
recorded. Post-storm costs and expected recoveries are recorded net with “General and
administrative” expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income, except
for depreciation of non-damaged assets, which is classified as “Depreciation and
amortization.”

The insurance receivable is recorded within “Deposits and other assets, net” in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Through December 31, 2005, the Company
received $46 million from its insurers, leaving a net receivable of $125 million at
December 31, 2005.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents include investments and
interest bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of
acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost which approximates market value.
Book overdraft balances resulting from the Company’s cash management program are
recorded as accounts payable.

Accounts receivable and credit risk.

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of casino
accounts receivable. The Company issues markers to approved casino customers following
background checks and investigations of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2005, a
substantial portion of the Company’s receivables were due from customers residing in
foreign countries. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these
countries could affect the collectibility of such receivables.

Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically
non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when
management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously
written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is
maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their carrying amount, which
approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of
customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and
business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2005, no significant
concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been
recorded.

Inventories.

Inventories consist of food and beverage, retail merchandise and
operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
primarily by the average cost method for food and beverage and supplies and the retail
inventory or specific identification methods for retail merchandise.

Property and equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Gains or
losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the determination of
income. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment are
generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line
basis:

Buildings and improvements

30 to 45 years

Land improvements

10 to 20 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 10 years

Equipment

3 to 20 years



We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment
in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets.” For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset to be sold at the lower
of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value for assets to be
disposed of is estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a
discounted cash flow model.

For assets to be held and used, we review fixed assets for impairment whenever
indicators of impairment exist. If an indicator of impairment exists, we compare the
estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying
value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no
impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying
value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value,
with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still
under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. For a
discussion of recognized impairment losses, see Note 16.

Capitalized interest.

The interest cost associated with major development and
construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project. When no
debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended
on the project using the weighted-average cost of the Company’s outstanding borrowings.
Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or
development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase
price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill
and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually
and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual
impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth
quarter of each fiscal year. No impairments were indicated as a result of the annual
impairment reviews for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2005, 2004 or
2003.

Revenue recognition and promotional allowances.

Casino revenue is the
aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for
funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and for
chips in the customers’ possession (“outstanding chip liability”). Hotel, food and
beverage, entertainment and other operating revenues are recognized as services are
performed. Advance deposits on rooms and advance ticket sales are recorded as accrued
liabilities until services are provided to the customer.

Gaming revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives, including discounts
and points earned in point-loyalty programs. The retail value of accommodations, food
and beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross
revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. The estimated cost of providing
such promotional allowances is primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Advertising.

The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising
takes place. Advertising expense, which is generally included in general and
administrative expenses, was $99 million, $57 million and $54 million for 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Corporate expense.

Corporate expense represents unallocated payroll and aircraft
costs, professional fees and various other expenses not directly related to the
Company’s casino resort operations. In addition, corporate expense includes the costs
associated with the Company’s evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities,
which are expensed as incurred until development of a specific project has become
probable.

Preopening and start-up expenses.

The Company accounts for costs incurred during
the preopening and start-up phases of operations in accordance with Statement of
Position 98-5, “Reporting on the Costs of Start-up
Activities.” Preopening and start-up
costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as
preopening and start-up expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and
other expenses related to new or start-up operations and new customer initiatives.



Income per share of common stock.

The weighted-average number of common and common
equivalent shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share

Stock-based compensation.

The Company has accounted for stock-based compensation,
including employee stock option plans, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and the Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions involving
Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25,” and has disclosed
supplemental information in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), as amended by Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS 148”). The Company has not incurred compensation
expense for employee stock options when the exercise price is at least 100% of the
market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. For disclosure
purposes, employee stock options have been measured at fair value using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model and compensation has been assumed to be amortized
over the vesting periods of the options.

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 123
(revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS

123(R)”).

Under the original standard,
SFAS No. 123, companies had the option of recording stock options issued to employees at
fair value or intrinsic value, which generally leads to no expense being recorded. The
Company opted to use this intrinsic value method and make required disclosures of fair
value expense. SFAS 123(R) eliminates this intrinsic value
alternative. SFAS 123(R) was effective for the Company on
January 1, 2006, and all future share-based
payments must be recorded at fair value.

The Company has adopted nonqualified stock option plans and incentive stock option
plans which provide for the granting of stock options to eligible directors, officers
and employees. The plans are administered by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee
of the Board of Directors. Salaried officers, directors and other key employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to receive options. The exercise price in
each instance is 100% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date
of grant. The options have either 7-year or 10-year terms and in most cases are
exercisable in either four or five equal annual installments.

As of December 31, 2005, the aggregate number of stock options available for grant
was 6.5 million. A summary of the status of the Company’s stock option plans is
presented below:

NOTE 3 — ACQUISITION

On April 25, 2005, the Company closed its merger with Mandalay under which the
Company acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Mandalay for $71 in cash for
each share of Mandalay’s common stock. The acquisition expands the Company’s portfolio
of resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, provides additional sites for future development and
expands the Company’s employee and customer bases significantly. These factors result
in the recognition of certain intangible assets, discussed below, and significant
goodwill. The total acquisition cost included (in thousands):

Cash paid, net of cash acquired, was $4.4 billion. The transaction was accounted
for as a purchase and, accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the underlying
assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the
date of the acquisition. The purchase price allocation is preliminary and may be
adjusted up to one year after the acquisition. In particular, the Company is still
evaluating certain customer relationship intangible assets related to individual and
group hotel reservations as well as gaming loyalty program members.

The following table sets forth the preliminary allocation of purchase price (in
thousands):

The amount allocated to intangible assets includes the recognition of customer
lists with an estimated value of $12 million and an estimated useful life of five years
and trade names and trademarks with an estimated value of $234 million and an indefinite
life. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized.

The operating results for Mandalay are included in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income from the date of the acquisition. The following unaudited pro

NOTE 4 — DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In June 2003, the Company ceased operations of PLAYMGMMIRAGE.com, its online gaming
website (“Online”). In January 2004, the Company completed the sale of the Golden
Nugget Las Vegas in downtown Las Vegas and the Golden Nugget Laughlin in Laughlin,
Nevada (the “Golden Nugget Subsidiaries”), with net proceeds to the Company of $210
million. In July 2004, the Company completed the sale of the subsidiaries that owned
and operated MGM Grand Australia with net proceeds to the Company of $136 million.



The results of the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries, Online and MGM Grand Australia
are classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income for all periods presented. Net revenues of discontinued operations were $45
million and $231 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003.
Included in income from discontinued operations is an allocation of interest expense
based on the ratio of the net assets of the discontinued operations to the total
consolidated net assets and debt of the Company. Interest allocated to discontinued
operations was $2 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively. Included in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003
is a loss on disposal of Online of $7 million relating primarily to unrecoverable costs
of computer hardware and software. Included in the tax benefit from discontinued
operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 is $2 million of previously unrecognized
tax benefits relating to prior year operating losses of Online. Included in
discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 is a gain on the sale of
the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries of $8 million and a gain on sale of MGM Grand Australia
of $74 million.

Total interest incurred during 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $686 million, $401 million
and $353 million, respectively, of which $30 million, $23 million and $15 million,
respectively, was capitalized.

At December 31, 2005, the senior credit facility had total capacity of $7.0
billion. The senior credit facility matures in 2010 and consists of a $5.5 billion
revolving credit facility and $1.5 billion term loan facility. The current senior
credit facility was made available upon the closing of the Mandalay merger, and replaced
the Company’s previous $2.5 billion senior credit facility.

Interest on the senior credit facility is based on the bank reference rate or
Eurodollar rate. The Company’s borrowing rate on the senior credit facility was
approximately 5.3% at December 31, 2005 and 3.3% at December 31, 2004. Stand-by letters
of credit totaling $53 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2005, thereby
reducing the availability under the senior credit facility. At
December 31, 2005, the Company had approximately $2.2 billion of
available borrowings under the senior credit facility.

In June 2005, the Company issued $500 million of 6.625% senior notes due 2015 and
in September 2005, the Company issued an additional $375 million of 6.625% senior notes
due 2015. In 2004, the Company issued $525 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2014, $550
million of 6.75% senior notes due 2012, and $450 million of 6% senior notes due 2009.
The proceeds of the above offerings were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under the
Company’s senior credit facility.



In May 2005, the Company initiated a tender offer for several issuances of
Mandalay’s senior notes and senior subordinated notes totaling $1.5 billion, as required
by the change of control provisions contained in the respective indentures. Holders of
$155 million of Mandalay’s senior notes and senior subordinated notes redeemed their
holdings, resulting in a gain on early retirement of debt of $1 million, classified as
“Other, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Holders of
Mandalay’s floating rate convertible senior debentures with a principal amount of $394
million had the right to redeem the debentures for $566 million through June 30, 2005.
$388 million of principal of the convertible senior debentures were tendered for
redemption and redeemed for $558 million.

In February 2005, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 6.875% senior notes
due February 2008 at the present value of future interest payments plus accrued interest
at the date of redemption. The Company recorded a loss on retirement of debt of $20
million in the first quarter of 2005, classified as “Other, net” in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income. As a result of the redemption of the February 2008
senior notes and the repayment of the $300 million 6.95% senior notes that matured in
February 2005, the Company applied for, and received, release of collateral under its
senior credit facility and all of its senior notes. Therefore, the Company’s senior
credit facility and senior notes are now unsecured.

In August 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
$100 million of the Company’s public debt securities. Subsequently, the Company
repurchased $25 million of its senior notes and recorded a loss on early retirement of
debt of $3 million related to repurchase premiums and unamortized debt issue costs. In
2004, the Company repurchased an additional $49 million of its senior notes for $52
million. This resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of $6 million related to
repurchase premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs. The losses in both periods are
classified as “Other, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. In
December 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors renewed its authorization for up to $100
million of additional debt securities.

The Company attempts to limit its exposure to interest rate risk by managing the
mix of its long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under its bank
credit facilities. In the past, the Company has also utilized interest rate swap agreements
to manage this risk. At December 31, 2005, the Company had no outstanding interest rate
swaps. All of the Company’s interest rate swaps have met the criteria for using the
“shortcut method” allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133.
The amounts received for the termination of past interest rate swaps, including the last
$100 million swap terminated in May 2005, have been added to the carrying value of the
related debt obligations and are being amortized and recorded as a reduction of interest
expense over the remaining life of that debt.

The Company and each of its material subsidiaries, excluding MGM Grand Detroit, LLC
and the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, are directly liable for or unconditionally
guarantee the senior credit facility, senior notes, senior debentures, and senior
subordinated notes. MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is a guarantor under the senior credit
facility, but only to the extent that the proceeds of borrowings under such facilities
are made available to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC. See Note 18 for consolidating condensed
financial information of the subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantors.

The Company’s long-term debt obligations contain customary covenants requiring the
Company to maintain certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2005, the Company was
required to maintain a maximum leverage ratio (debt to EBITDA, as
defined) of 7.25:1 and
a maximum senior leverage ratio of 5.75:1. Also at December 31, 2005, the Company was
required to maintain a minimum coverage ratio (EBITDA to interest charges, as defined)
of 2.0:1. As of December 31, 2005, the Company’s leverage, senior leverage and interest
coverage ratios were 5.4:1, 4.5:1 and 2.9:1, respectively.

The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2005 was
approximately $12.5 billion, versus its book value of $12.4 billion. At December 31,
2004, the estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was approximately $5.9
billion, versus its book value of $5.5 billion. The estimated fair value of the
Company’s public debt securities was based on quoted market prices on or about December
31, 2005 and 2004. The estimated fair value of the Company’s senior credit facility was
assumed to approximate book value due to the short-term nature of the borrowings.

NOTE 11 — INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109
requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets, net of applicable reserves,
related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences. The
standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of
such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.

For U.S. federal income tax return purposes, the Company has a net operating loss
carryforward of $2 million, which will begin to expire in 2012. For state income tax
purposes, the Company has a New Jersey net operating loss carryforward of $112 million,
which equates to a deferred tax asset of $7 million, after federal tax effect, and
before valuation allowance. The New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards began to
expire in 2005.

At December 31, 2005, there is a $6 million valuation allowance provided on certain
New Jersey state net operating loss carryforwards and other New Jersey state deferred
tax assets and a $2 million valuation allowance related to certain foreign deferred tax
assets because management believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not”
criteria for recognition under SFAS 109. Management believes all other deferred tax
assets are more likely than not to be realized because of the future reversal of
existing taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. Accordingly,
there are no other valuation allowances provided at December 31, 2005.

As anticipated, the United States Treasury issued guidance during 2005 that
clarified provisions of the American Job Creation Act of 2004 (the “Act”) that provide
for a special one-time deduction of 85 percent on certain repatriated earnings of
foreign subsidiaries. This guidance clarified for the Company that the planned
repatriation of the net proceeds of its Australia operations would qualify for the
one-time deduction. Consequently, the Company repatriated the net proceeds during 2005
and secured the benefits of the deduction. Since the Company provided deferred
taxes in 2004 on the basis that the net proceeds would be repatriated without the benefit of the
one-time deduction, a tax benefit of $10 million was recorded in 2005 to reflect the
benefit of the Act. The Company considered the earnings of its Australia operations
permanently reinvested prior to the sale of such operations in 2004.

NOTE 12 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases.

The Company leases real estate and various equipment under operating and,
to a lesser extent, capital lease arrangements. Certain real estate leases provide for
escalation of rent based upon a specified price index and/or based upon periodic
appraisals.



At December 31, 2005, the Company was obligated under non-cancelable operating
leases and capital leases to make future minimum lease payments as follows:

obligations,” respectively, in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rental expense for operating leases was
$23 million, $19 million and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and
2003, respectively.

Detroit Development Agreement.

Under the August 2002 revised development agreement
with the City of Detroit, MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and the Company are subject to certain
obligations in exchange for the ability to develop a permanent casino complex. The
Company recorded an intangible asset (development rights, deemed to have an indefinite
life) in connection with its obligations under the revised development agreement.
Outstanding obligations include continued letter of credit support for $50 million of
bonds issued by the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit, which
mature in 2009. In addition, the City required an indemnification of up to $20 million
related to the Lac Vieux and certain other litigation, of which $2.5 million had been
paid as of December 31, 2005. In addition to the above obligations, the Company will
pay the City of Detroit 2% of gaming revenues (1% if annual revenues do not exceed $400
million) beginning January 1, 2006.

Until April 2005, the ability to construct the permanent casino facility was
subject to resolution of the Lac Vieux litigation. In April 2005, the 6

th

Circuit Court of Appeals ruled on the three pending appeals, approved the settlement
agreement between Lac Vieux and the two other Detroit casino developers, dismissed Lac
Vieux’s request for a reselection process for our subsidiary’s casino franchise and
lifted the injunction prohibiting the City and the Detroit developers from commencing
construction of the permanent hotel and casino complexes. As a result of the resolution
of the Lac Vieux litigation and the current status of the other
litigation to which the indemnification relates, the Company determined that the necessary accrual for the
indemnification to the City was $2.5 million, and recorded a reduction in accrued
liabilities and a corresponding reduction in the development rights intangible asset.

The Company has acquired the land and begun construction on the permanent casino
facility. The permanent facility is expected to open in late 2007 at a cost of $765
million, including land and preopening costs, and will feature a 400-room hotel,
100,000-square foot casino, numerous restaurant and entertainment amenities, and spa and
convention facilities. The complete design, timing and cost of the permanent facility
are at a preliminary stage, and are subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects.

Macau

. In connection with its investment in MGM Grand Paradise Limited, the
Company has committed to loan the entity up to $100 million, which will be accounted for
as an additional element of the Company’s investment in the venture.

New York Racing Association.

The Company has entered into a definitive agreement
with the New York Racing Association (“NYRA”) to manage video lottery terminals (“VLTs”)
at NYRA’s Aqueduct horseracing facility in metropolitan New York. The Company will
assist in the development of the approximately $170 million facility, including
providing project financing, and will manage the facility for a term of five years
(extended automatically if the financing provided by the Company is not fully repaid)
for a fee. Recent legislative changes will allow the Company to operate the VLTs past
the expiration date of the current NYRA franchise agreement.



United Kingdom.

In November 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with
Newcastle United PLC to create a 50-50 joint venture, which would build a major new
mixed-use development, including a regional casino, on a site adjacent to Newcastle
United’s football stadium. The Company made an equity investment of £5 million ($8.6
million based on exchange rates at December 31, 2005). The agreement is cancelable, and
the equity investment is refundable, if certain conditions are not met within specified
time frames, including obtaining a regional casino license and regulatory approvals, and
the implementation of an acceptable tax regime.

The Company had an agreement with the Earls Court and Olympia Group, which operates
large trade show facilities in London, to develop an entertainment
and gaming facility. In 2005, the agreement was terminated and the Company received a refund of its £1.75
million deposit ($3.2 million).

The Signature at MGM Grand.

In 2004, the venture obtained construction financing
for up to $210 million for the development of Tower 1. The Company has provided a
guaranty for up to 50% of the interest and principal obligations on the construction
financing. The remaining 50% of interest and principal obligations is guaranteed by
affiliates of the venture’s other member. These affiliates and the Company have also
jointly and severally provided a completion guaranty.

In 2005, the venture obtained construction financing for up to $230 million for the
development of Tower 2. The Company has provided a guaranty for up to 50% of the
interest and principal obligations on the construction financing, with such guaranty
decreasing by 50% relative to the principal when construction is 50% complete. The
remaining 50% of interest and principal obligations is guaranteed by affiliates of the
venture’s other investor. These affiliates and the Company have also jointly and
severally provided a completion guaranty. The Company recorded the value of its
guaranty obligations for Towers 1 and 2, approximately $3 million, in “Other long-term
liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

Other guarantees.

The Company is party to various guarantee contracts in the
normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of credit issued by
financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit facility limits the amount of
letters of credit that can be issued to $250 million, and the amount of available
borrowings under the senior credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of
credit. At December 31, 2005, the Company had provided a $50 million letter of credit
to support the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit bonds referred to
above, which are a liability of the Company.

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which
relate to routine matters incidental to its business. Management does not believe that
the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 13 — STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY

Stock split.

In May 2005, the Company completed a 2-for-1 stock split effected in
the form of a 100% stock dividend. The additional shares were issued on May 18, 2005 to
stockholders of record on May 4, 2005. All share and per share data in the accompanying
financial statements and notes thereto have been restated for all periods presented to
reflect the 100% stock dividend.

Stock repurchases.

Share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase programs
approved by the Board of Directors and publicly announced. Share repurchase activity

Restricted stock.

In May 2002, the Board of Directors approved a restricted stock
plan. The plan allowed for the issuance of up to 2 million shares of Company common
stock to certain key employees. The restrictions on selling 50% of
these shares lapsed on
the third anniversary date from the grant date and the restrictions
lapse on the remaining 50% on the fourth anniversary date
after the grant date. Through December 31, 2005, 1,806,000 shares were issued, with an
aggregate value of $32 million. This amount was recorded as deferred compensation in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized to operating expenses
on a straight-line basis through the period in which the restrictions fully lapse.
Amortization of deferred compensation was $7 million, $7 million and $8 million for the
years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In November 2002, the Board
of Directors determined that no more awards would be granted under the plan.

Through December 31, 2005, restrictions on 852,000 shares have lapsed and 120,000
shares were cancelled before the restrictions had lapsed, leaving 834,000 restricted
shares outstanding, all of which will become unrestricted in 2006. In 2005, certain
recipients of restricted shares elected to use a portion of the shares on which
restrictions lapsed in 2005 to pay required withholding taxes. Approximately 261,000
shares were surrendered, and became treasury shares, as a result of these elections.

NOTE 14 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Employees of the Company who are members of various unions are covered by
union-sponsored, collectively bargained, multi-employer health and welfare and defined
benefit pension plans. The Company recorded an expense of $161 million in 2005, $86
million in 2004 and $77 million in 2003 under such plans. The plans’ sponsors have not
provided sufficient information to permit the Company to determine its share of unfunded
vested benefits, if any.

The Company is self-insured for most health care benefits for its non-union
employees. The liability for claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not
reported is included in “Other accrued liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets.

The Company has retirement savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code for eligible employees. The plans allow employees to defer, within
prescribed limits, up to 30% of their income on a pre-tax basis through contributions to
the plans. The Company matches, within prescribed limits, a portion of eligible
employees’ contributions. In the case of certain union employees, the Company
contributions to the plan are based on hours worked. The Company recorded charges for
401(k) contributions of $19 million in 2005, $12 million in 2004 and $10 million in
2003.

The Company maintains a nonqualified deferred retirement plan for certain key
employees. The plan allows participants to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion of their
salary and bonus and accumulate tax deferred earnings, plus investment earnings on the
deferred balances, as a retirement fund. Participants receive a Company match of up to
4% of salary, net of any Company match received under the Company’s 401(k) plan. All
employee deferrals vest immediately. The Company matching contributions vest ratably
over a three-year period. The Company recorded charges for matching contributions of $2
million in 2005, $1 million in 2004 and $2 million in 2003.

The Company implemented a supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) for
certain key employees effective January 1, 2001. The SERP is a nonqualified plan under
which the Company makes quarterly contributions which are intended to provide a
retirement benefit that is a fixed percentage of a participant’s estimated final
five-year average annual salary, up to a maximum of 65%. Company contributions and
investment earnings on the contributions are tax-deferred and accumulate as a retirement
fund. Employees do not make contributions under this plan. A portion of the Company
contributions and investment earnings thereon vests after three years of SERP
participation and the remaining portion vests after both five years of SERP
participation and 10 years of continuous service. The Company recorded expense under
this plan of $6 million in 2005, $5 million in 2004 and $5 million in 2003.

Mandalay sponsored a defined benefit pension plan (the “Mandalay SERP”) under which
certain key employees earned supplemental pension benefits based upon their respective
years of service, compensation and tier category set out in the plan document. The
Mandalay SERP was terminated in July 2005 and lump-sum payouts to the plan participants
in the aggregate amount of $145 million were made. In purchase accounting, all
previously recognized amounts related to the SERP were eliminated and a liability was
recorded at the value of the lump-sum payouts as of the date of the merger,
approximately $146 million. Related investments intended to fund the Mandalay SERP of
$96 million were liquidated in July 2005 and used to fund a portion of the lump-sum
payouts.

been fully paid or otherwise resolved.

In 2004, restructuring costs include $3 million for contract termination costs
related to the Aqua restaurant at Bellagio and $2 million of workforce reduction costs
at MGM Grand Detroit as a result of the Company’s efforts to minimize the impact of a
gaming tax increase in Michigan.

In 2003, restructuring costs included $2 million related to the closure of the
Siegfried & Roy show, primarily for severance costs of employees involved in the show’s
production. Also, the Company terminated a restaurant lease and closed two marketing
offices, resulting in $4 million of contract termination charges. Other severance of $1
million in 2003 related primarily to restructuring of table games staffing at several
resorts.

In 2005, recognized impairments relate primarily to assets removed from service in
connection with new capital projects at several resorts, including Bellagio, TI, The
Mirage and Mandalay Bay. The amount of the impairments was based on the net book value
of the disposed assets. Abandoned projects included individually insignificant projects
at several resorts. Demolition costs related primarily to room remodel activity at MGM
Grand Las Vegas and the new showroom at The Mirage.

In 2004, there were no material unusual property transactions. In 2003, the
Company sold 315 acres of land in North Las Vegas, Nevada near Shadow Creek for
approximately $55 million, which resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $37 million.
Also in 2003, the Company recorded write-downs and impairments of assets abandoned or
replaced with new construction, primarily at MGM Grand Las Vegas in preparation for new
restaurants and the

KÀ

theatre. Demolition costs in 2004 and 2003 relate primarily to
preparation for the Bellagio standard room remodel, Bellagio
expansion and the

Borgata leases 10 acres from the Company on a long-term basis for use in its
current operations and for its expansion. Additionally Borgata leases nine acres from
the Company on a short-term basis for surface parking. The net reimbursements from
Borgata are related to Borgata’s responsibility for a portion of the master plan
improvements at Renaissance Pointe and the Company’s responsibility for environmental
cleanup costs incurred by Borgata. The rent payments from The
Signature of MGM Grand are for the sales office, which is located
inside MGM Grand Las Vegas. The tram payments to Monte Carlo were compensation
for lost business as a result of closing the tram between Bellagio and Monte Carlo in
preparation for the Bellagio expansion.

Primarily
all of the professional fees paid to related parties were for legal fees to a firm
affiliated with the Company’s general counsel and a former
director of the Company. At December 31, 2005, the Company owed the
firm $3.1 million.
