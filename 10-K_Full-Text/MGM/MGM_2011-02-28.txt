PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

MGM Resorts International is referred to as the
    “Company” or the “Registrant,” and together
    with our subsidiaries may also be referred to as “we,”
    “us” or “our.”

Overview

MGM Resorts International is one of the world’s leading and
    most respected companies with significant holdings in gaming,
    hospitality and entertainment. We believe the resorts we own,
    manage and invest in are among the world’s finest casino
    resorts. MGM Resorts International is a Delaware corporation
    that acts largely as a holding company; our operations are
    conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries.

Our strategy is to generate sustainable, profitable growth by
    creating and maintaining competitive advantages and through the
    execution of our business plan, which is focused on:

•

Owning, developing, operating and strategically investing in a
    strong portfolio of resorts;

•

Operating our resorts in a manner that emphasizes the delivery
    of excellent customer service with the goal of maximizing
    revenue and profit; and

•

Leveraging our strong brands and taking advantage of significant
    management experience and expertise.

Resort
    Portfolio

We execute our strategy through a portfolio approach, seeking to
    ensure that we own, manage and invest in resorts that are
    superior to our competitors’ resorts in the markets in
    which our resorts are located, as well as across our customer
    base. Our customer base is discussed below under “Resort
    Operation.”

We selectively acquire, invest in and develop resorts in markets
    with a stable regulatory history and environment. As seen in the
    table below, this means that a large portion of our resorts are
    located in Nevada. We target markets with growth potential and
    we believe there is growth potential in investing in and
    managing both gaming and non-gaming resorts. Our growth
    strategies are discussed in greater detail below under
    “Sustainable Growth and Leveraging Our Brand and Management
    Assets.”

Our
    Operating Resorts

We have provided certain information below about our resorts as
    of December 31, 2010. Except as otherwise indicated, we
    wholly own and operate the resorts shown below.

Form 10-K,

which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

Portfolio
    Strategy

We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the
    markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the
    premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital
    investments that target our goal of creating the best possible
    experiences for our guests. We have historically made
    significant investments in our resorts through the addition of
    new restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, and
    other new features and amenities. In addition, we have made
    regular capital investments to maintain the quality of our hotel
    rooms and public spaces. The quality of our resorts and
    amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous
    awards, such as several Four and Five Diamond designations from
    the American Automobile Association and Four and Five Star
    designations from Mobil Travel.

We also actively manage our portfolio of land holdings. We own
    approximately 670 acres of land on the Las Vegas
    Strip, with a meaningful portion of those acres undeveloped
    acreage or acreage we consider to be under-developed.

Risks
    Associated with Our Portfolio Strategy

Certain principal risk factors relating to our current portfolio
    of resorts are:

•

Our limited geographic diversification – our major
    resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip and some of our
    largest competitors operate in more gaming markets than we do;

•

There are a number of gaming facilities located closer to our
    customers’ homes than our resorts; and

•

Additional new resort casinos and expansion projects at existing
    Las Vegas resort casinos have recently opened and new resorts
    could open in future periods. We are unable to determine to what
    extent increased competition will affect our future operating
    results.

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a more detailed
    discussion of these and other risk factors.



Resort
    Operation

Our operating philosophy is to create resorts of memorable
    character, to treat our employees as valued and respected team
    members and to provide superior service for our guests. In
    addition, we also seek to develop competitive advantages in
    specific markets and among specific customer groups.

General

We primarily own and operate casino resorts that include gaming,
    hotel, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities.
    Over half of our net revenue is derived from non-gaming
    activities, a higher percentage than many of our competitors, as
    we provide a complete resort experience for our guests,
    including high quality non-gaming amenities for which our guests
    are willing to pay a premium.

As a resort-based company, our operating results are highly
    dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in
    turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and
    other amenities. Since we believe that the number of walk-in
    customers affects the success of our casino resorts, we design
    our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other
    hotels. We also generate a significant portion of our operating
    income from the high-end gaming segment, which can cause
    variability in our results.

Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers
    wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash
    or credit cards. Our resorts, like many in the industry,
    generate significant operating cash flow. Our industry is
    capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our
    resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing,
    fund capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future
    development.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature,
    though a variety of factors can affect the results of any
    interim period, including the timing of major Las Vegas
    conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special
    events for our high-end customers, and the level of play during
    major holidays, including New Year and Chinese New Year. Our
    significant convention and meeting facilities are utilized to
    maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during off-peak
    times, such as mid-week or traditionally slower leisure travel
    periods, which also leads to better labor utilization. Our
    results do not depend on key individual customers, although our
    success in marketing to customer groups, such as convention
    customers, or the financial health of customer segments, such as
    business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a
    particular country or region, can affect our results.

All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day
    of the year, with the exception of Grand Victoria which operates
    22 hours a day, every day of the year. At our wholly-owned
    resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and
    managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated
    by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or
    leased to third parties. We generally have an operating
    philosophy that favors ownership and management of amenities,
    since guests have direct contact with staff in these areas and
    we prefer to control all aspects of the guest experience;
    however, we do lease space to retail and food and beverage
    operators, particularly for branding opportunities and when
    capital investment by us is not desirable or feasible. We also
    operate many “managed” outlets, utilizing third-party
    management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants
    and nightclubs, as well as for branding opportunities.

Customers
    and Competition

Our casino resorts generally operate in highly competitive
    environments. We compete against other gaming companies, as well
    as other hospitality and leisure and business travel companies.
    Our primary methods of successful competition include:

•

Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel
    markets, and operating at superior sites within those markets;

•

Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and
    facilities, including luxurious guestrooms,

state-of-the-art

convention facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail
    and other amenities;

•

Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated
    employees who provide superior and friendly customer service;



•

Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment
    attractions; and

•

Developing distinctive and memorable marketing and promotional
    programs.

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large
    number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including
    major hotel casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel
    casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the
    center of the Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere
    in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip resorts also compete,
    in part, with each other. According to the Las Vegas Convention
    and Visitors Authority, there were approximately 149,000
    guestrooms in Las Vegas at December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009. At December 31, 2010, we operated
    approximately 28% of the guestrooms in Las Vegas. Las Vegas
    visitor volume was 37.3 million in 2010, a 3% increase from
    the 36.4 million reported for 2009.

The principal segments of the Las Vegas gaming market are
    leisure travel; premium gaming customers; conventions, including
    small meetings, trade associations, and corporate incentive
    programs; and tour and travel. Our luxury wholly-owned
    properties, including Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay
    Bay, and The Mirage, appeal to the upper end of each market
    segment, balancing their business by using the convention and
    tour and travel segments to fill the mid-week and off-peak
    periods. Our marketing strategy for New York-New York, Luxor and
    Monte Carlo is aimed at attracting middle- to
    upper-middle-income customers, largely from the leisure travel
    and, to a lesser extent, the tour and travel segments. Excalibur
    and Circus Circus Las Vegas generally cater to the
    value-oriented and middle-income leisure travel and tour and
    travel segments.

Outside Las Vegas, our other wholly-owned Nevada operations
    compete with each other and with many other similarly sized and
    larger operations. Our Nevada resorts located outside of Las
    Vegas appeal primarily to the value-oriented leisure traveler
    and the value-oriented local customer. A significant number of
    our customers at these resorts come from California. We believe
    the expansion of Native American gaming in California has had a
    negative impact on all of our Nevada resorts not located on the
    Las Vegas Strip, and additional expansion in California could
    have a further adverse effect on these resorts.

Outside Nevada, our wholly-owned resorts primarily compete for
    customers in local and regional gaming markets, where location
    is a critical factor to success. For instance, in Tunica,
    Mississippi, one of our competitors is closer to Memphis, the
    area’s principal market. In addition, we compete with
    gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure
    destinations in each region. For example, in Detroit, Michigan
    we also compete with a casino in nearby Windsor, Canada and with
    Native American casinos in Michigan. In Biloxi, Mississippi we
    also compete with regional riverboat and land-based casinos in
    Louisiana, Native American casinos in central Mississippi and
    with casinos in Florida and the Bahamas.

Aria, which we manage and of which we own 50% through the
    CityCenter joint venture (“CityCenter”), appeals to
    the upper end of each segment in the Las Vegas market and
    competes with our wholly-owned luxury casino resorts. Our other
    unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers against
    casino resorts in their respective markets. Much like our
    wholly-owned resorts, our unconsolidated affiliates compete
    through the quality of amenities, the value of the experience
    offered to guests, and the location of their resorts.

Our casino resorts also compete for customers with hotel casino
    operations located in other areas of the United States and
    other parts of the world, and for leisure and business travelers
    with non-gaming tourist destinations such as Hawaii, Florida and
    California. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent
    with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card
    parlors, and other forms of legalized gaming in the United
    States.

Marketing

We advertise on the radio, television, internet and billboards
    and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout
    the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail and
    through the use of social media. We also advertise through our
    regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and
    foreign cities. A key element of marketing to premium gaming
    customers is personal contact by our marketing personnel. Direct
    marketing is also important in the convention segment. We
    maintain internet websites to inform customers about our resorts
    and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms, make restaurant
    reservations and purchase show tickets. We actively utilize
    several social media sites to promote our brands, unique events,
    and special deals. We also operate call centers to allow
    customer contact by phone to make hotel and restaurant
    reservations and purchase show tickets.



We recently introduced a new players club loyalty program
    (“M life”). M life was introduced at our regional
    resorts in the third quarter of 2010, and to the remaining
    participating wholly-owned casino resorts and Aria on
    January 11, 2011. M life is our new player loyalty program
    that provides access to rewards, privileges, and members-only
    events. M life is a tiered system and allows customers to
    qualify for benefits across our participating resorts,
    regardless of where they play, encouraging customers to keep
    their total gaming spend within our casino resorts.

M life combines slots and table games play into one account and
    customers earn tiered rewards on both types of play. Customers
    earn “express comps,” which can be redeemed at
    restaurants, box offices, the M life players club, or kiosks at
    participating properties. Players can also redeem their express
    comps for M life “Moments,” which allow members to
    take advantage of unique and

once-in-a-lifetime

experiences such as picking the Bellagio Fountain songs for a
    day, being a trainer for a day with the dolphins at The Mirage
    and

meet-and-greets

with performers and celebrity chefs across our resort portfolio.
    Members of M life also continue to earn points redeemable
    for free play.

M life is currently a casino centered program but will expand to
    a broad-based program recognizing and rewarding customer
    spending across most channels focusing on wallet share capture,
    loyalty and frequency of visits. Advanced analytic techniques
    and new information technology will better identify customer
    preferences and predict future behavior allowing us to make
    customers more relevant offers, influence incremental visits and
    help build lasting customer relationships.

In addition to the loyalty program, we have re-branded our
    company magazine and developed an in-room M life
    television channel to highlight customers’ experiences and
    showcase “Moments” customers can earn through the
    accumulation of express comps. We believe that M life will
    enable us to more effectively market to our customers, as well
    as allow us to personalize customers’ experiences.

We also utilize our world-class golf courses in marketing
    programs at our Las Vegas Strip resorts. Our major Las Vegas
    resorts offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges
    at Shadow Creek in North Las Vegas. In connection with our
    marketing activities, we also invite our premium gaming
    customers to play Shadow Creek on a complimentary basis. We also
    use Primm Valley Golf Club for marketing purposes at our Las
    Vegas Strip resorts. Additionally, marketing efforts at Beau
    Rivage benefit from Fallen Oak golf course 20 minutes north of
    Beau Rivage.

Employees
    and Management

We believe that knowledgeable, friendly and dedicated employees
    are a key success factor in the casino resort industry.
    Therefore, we invest heavily in recruiting, training and
    retaining exceptional highly motivated employees, as well as
    seeking to hire and promote the strongest management team
    possible. We have numerous programs, both at the corporate and
    business unit level, designed to achieve these objectives. For
    example, our diversity initiative extends throughout our
    company, and focuses on the unique strengths of our individuals
    combined with a culture of collaborative teamwork to achieve
    greater performance. Our diversity program has been widely
    recognized and has received numerous awards. We believe our
    internal development programs, such as the MGM Resorts
    University and various leadership and management training
    programs, are best in class among our industry peers.

Technology

We utilize various types of technology to maximize revenue and
    efficiency in our operations. We continue to move forward on
    standardizing the technology platforms for our hotel and point
    of sale systems, along with several other key operational
    systems. The standardization of these systems provides us with
    one consistent operating platform, allowing us efficiencies in
    training, reducing complexity in system integration and
    interfaces, standardizing processes across our casino resorts,
    and providing our customers with better information in
    connection with the implementation of M life.

Technology is also an important part of our strategy in
    non-gaming and administrative operations. Our hotel systems
    include yield management software programs at many of our
    resorts that help us maximize occupancy and room rates.
    Additionally, these systems capture charges made by our
    customers during their stay, including allowing customers of our
    resorts to charge meals and services at our other resorts to
    their hotel accounts.



Corporate
    Sustainability

We continue to gain recognition for our comprehensive
    company-wide environmental responsibility initiatives. During
    2010, we were the first resorts in Nevada and Michigan to earn
    certification from Green Key, the largest international program
    evaluating sustainable hotel operations. We received
    certifications at 12 resorts, including “Five Green
    Key” (the highest possible) ratings at Aria, Vdara and
    Mandalay Bay. Many major travel service providers recognize the
    Green Key designation and identify our resorts for their
    continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations. We believe
    that our sustainability efforts are particularly beneficial in
    meeting and convention bookings, as corporations and
    associations seek to extend their environmentally responsible
    practices by doing business with like-minded, environmentally
    friendly companies.

In addition, we believe that incorporating the tenets of
    sustainability in our business decisions provides a platform for
    innovation. CityCenter is one of the world’s largest
    private green developments. Aria, Vdara, Crystals, Mandarin
    Oriental, Veer, and the Aria Convention Center all have received
    LEED

®

Gold certification by the U.S. Green Building Council. This
    marks the highest LEED achievement for any hotel, retail
    district or residential development in Las Vegas. With this
    accomplishment, CityCenter created a new standard for combining
    luxury and environmental responsibility within the large-scale
    hospitality industry.

Internal
    Controls

We have a strong culture of compliance, driven by our history in
    the highly regulated gaming industry and our belief that
    compliance is a value-added activity. Our system of internal
    controls and procedures - including internal control over
    financial reporting – is designed to promote reliable
    and accurate financial records, transparent disclosures,
    compliance with laws and regulations, and protection of our
    assets. Our internal controls start at the source of business
    transactions, and we have rigorous enforcement at both the
    business unit and corporate level.

Our corporate management also reviews each of our businesses on
    a regular basis and we have a corporate internal audit function
    that performs regular reviews regarding gaming compliance,
    internal controls over financial reporting, and operations.

In addition, we maintain a compliance committee that administers
    our company-wide compliance plan. The compliance plan is in
    place to promote compliance with gaming and other laws
    applicable to our operations in all jurisdictions, including
    performing background investigations on our current and
    potential employees, directors and vendors as well as thorough
    review of proposed transactions and associations.

In connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our
    casinos, we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all
    receipts and disbursements and other activities, including cash
    transaction reporting which is essential in our industry. Our
    controls surrounding cash transactions include locked cash boxes
    on the casino floor, daily cash counts performed by employees
    who are independent of casino operations, constant observation
    and supervision of the gaming area, observation and recording of
    gaming and other areas by closed-circuit television, constant
    computer monitoring of our slot machines, and timely analysis of
    deviations from expected performance.

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games
    volume at Aria, Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and
    The Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to
    the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at
    certain of those casinos as well. We maintain strict controls
    over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection
    from those customers who fail to timely pay their marker
    balances. These collection efforts are similar to those used by
    most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer
    accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency
    notices, direct personal contact and the use of outside
    collection agencies and civil litigation.

In our U.S. jurisdictions, amounts owed for markers which
    are not timely paid are enforceable under state laws and all
    other states are required to enforce a judgment for amounts
    owed, pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the
    U.S. Constitution. Amounts owed for markers that are not
    timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign
    countries, but the U.S. assets of foreign customers may be
    reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States.



Risks
    Associated With Our Operating Strategy

Certain principal risk factors relating to our operating
    strategy are:

•

Our guestroom, dining and entertainment prices are often higher
    than those of most of our competitors in each market, although
    we believe that the quality of our facilities and services is
    also higher;

•

Our resort casinos compete to some extent with each other for
    customers. Aria, Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay
    Bay and The Mirage, in particular, compete for some of the same
    premium gaming customers; MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay
    also compete to some extent against each other in the
    large-scale convention business and for large entertainment
    events; and

•

Additional new hotel casinos and expansion projects at existing
    Las Vegas hotel casinos have recently opened and new resorts
    could open in future periods. We are unable to determine the
    extent to which increased competition will affect our future
    operating results.

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a more detailed
    discussion of these and other risk factors.

Sustainable
    Growth and Leveraging Our Brand and Management Assets

In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on
    managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts, spending
    on new resorts or initiatives and repaying long-term debt. We
    believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new
    initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide
    profitable returns, although these decisions have been
    significantly affected by economic conditions over the past
    several years, as well as by the recent financial crisis, which
    limited our access to capital.

We regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition
    opportunities in both the domestic and international markets,
    but cannot at this time determine the likelihood of proceeding
    with specific development opportunities. Opportunities we
    evaluate may include the ownership, management and operation of
    gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada or in states
    other than Nevada or outside of the United States. We may
    undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation
    with one or more third parties.

We leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands
    through strategic partnerships and international expansion
    opportunities. We feel that several of our brands, particularly
    the “MGM Grand,” “Bellagio,” and
    “Skylofts” brands, are well suited to new projects in
    both gaming and non-gaming developments. We formed MGM
    Hospitality, LLC (“MGM Hospitality”) to focus on
    strategic resort development and management opportunities, with
    an emphasis on international opportunities which we believe
    offer the greatest opportunity for future growth. We have hired
    senior personnel with established backgrounds in the development
    and management of international hospitality operations to
    maximize the profit potential of MGM Hospitality’s
    operations. MGM Hospitality currently has management agreements
    for hotels in the Middle East, North Africa, India and China.

MGM Grand
    Abu Dhabi

In November 2007, we announced plans to develop a multi-billion
    dollar, large-scale, mixed-use development that will serve as an
    incoming gateway to Abu Dhabi, a United Arab Emirate, located at
    a prominent downtown waterfront site on Abu Dhabi Island. The
    project will be owned entirely by Mubadala Development Company
    (“Mubadala”); we will not have a capital investment in
    this project. Mubadala has informed us that they do not intend
    to proceed with the project on the same time frame and scope as
    originally contemplated. As a result, we are currently engaged
    in discussions with Mubadala regarding the restructuring of the
    project.

China

We have formed a joint venture with the Diaoyutai State
    Guesthouse in Beijing, People’s Republic of China, to
    develop luxury non-gaming hotels and resorts in China, initially
    targeting prime locations, including Beijing, in the
    People’s Republic of China. Our first resort, under the
    “MGM Grand” brand, is currently scheduled to open in
    late



2011 in Sanya, China. We have signed multiple technical and
    management services agreements for resorts that are expected to
    open over the next four years. We have minimal capital
    investments in these projects.

Vietnam

In November 2008, we and Asian Coast Development Ltd. announced
    plans to develop MGM Grand Ho Tram, which is expected to open in
    2013. MGM Grand Ho Tram will anchor a multi-property complex on
    the Ho Tram Strip in the Ba Ria Vung Tau Province in southwest
    Vietnam. MGM Grand Ho Tram will be owned and financed by Asian
    Coast Development Ltd. and we will provide technical assistance
    and operate the luxury-integrated resort upon completion. We
    will have no capital investment in this project.

Mashantucket
    Pequot Tribal Nation

We have an agreement with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation
    (“MPTN”), which owns and operates Foxwoods Casino
    Resort in Mashantucket, Connecticut for the casino resort owned
    and operated by MPTN located adjacent to the Foxwoods Casino
    Resort to carry the “MGM Grand” brand name. We earn a
    fee for MPTN to use the “MGM Grand” name.

Risks
    Associated With Our Growth and Brand Management
    Strategies

Certain principal risk factors relating to our growth strategy
    are:

•

Development and operation of gaming facilities in new or
    existing jurisdictions are subject to many contingencies, some
    of which are outside of our control and may include the passage
    of appropriate gaming legislation, the issuance of necessary
    permits, licenses and approvals, the availability of appropriate
    financing and the satisfaction of other conditions;

•

Operations in which we may engage in foreign territories are
    subject to risks pertaining to international operations that may
    include financial risks such as foreign currency, adverse tax
    consequences, inability to adequately enforce our rights; and
    regulatory and political risks such as foreign government
    regulations, general geopolitical risks including political and
    economic instability, hostilities with neighboring countries,
    and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships; and

•

Expansion projects involve risks and uncertainties. For example,
    the design, timing and costs of the projects may change and are
    subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects to the extent
    we are responsible for financing such projects.

See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a more detailed
    discussion of these and other risk factors.

Intellectual
    Property

Our principal intellectual property consists of, among others,
    Bellagio, The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, MGM Grand, Luxor,
    Excalibur, New York-New York, Circus Circus and Beau Rivage
    trademarks, all of which have been registered or allowed in
    various classes in the U.S. We are currently undergoing the
    application process for the MGM Resorts International trademark.
    In addition, we have also registered or applied to register
    numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties,
    facilities and development projects in the U.S. We have
    also registered

and/or

applied to register many of our trademarks in various other
    foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under
    which we market our properties and services. We consider these
    brand names to be important to our business since they have the
    effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the
    name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed
    attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark
    registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used
    and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and
    maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals
    for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our
    trademark rights.

Employees
    and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately
    45,000 full-time and 16,000 part-time employees of
    which 5,700 and 2,800, respectively, relate to CityCenter. At
    that date, we had collective bargaining contracts with unions



covering approximately 30,000 of our employees. We consider our
    employee relations to be good. The collective bargaining
    agreements covering most of our union employees are subject to
    renegotiation in 2012.

Regulation
    and Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain
    our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.
    Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the
    laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is
    located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the
    responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners,
    managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming
    operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result
    in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.

A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are
    subject is contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report
    on

Form 10-K,

which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local
    laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These
    laws and regulations include, but are not limited to,
    restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages,
    environmental matters, employees, currency transactions,
    taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and
    advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be
    interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and
    regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or
    regulations, or material differences in interpretations by
    courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our
    operating results.

Cautionary
    Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

This

Form 10-K

and our 2010 Annual Report to Stockholders contain
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as
    “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,”
    “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,”
    “expects,” “will,” “may” and
    similar references to future periods. Examples of
    forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
    statements we make regarding our ability to generate significant
    cash flow; and amounts that we expect to receive in federal tax
    refunds, amounts we will invest in capital expenditures, amounts
    we will pay under the CityCenter completion guarantee, and
    amounts we may receive from the sale of residential units at
    CityCenter. The foregoing is not a complete list of all
    forward-looking statements we make.

Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations
    and assumptions regarding our business, the economy and other
    future conditions. Because forward-looking statements relate to
    the future, they are subject to inherent uncertainties, risks,
    and changes in circumstances that are difficult to predict. Our
    actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by
    the forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of
    historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future
    performance. Therefore, we caution you against relying on any of
    these forward-looking statements. Important factors that could
    cause actual results to differ materially from those in the
    forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to,
    regional, national or global political, economic, business,
    competitive, market, and regulatory conditions and the following:

•

our substantial indebtedness and significant financial
    commitments and our ability to satisfy our obligations;

•

current and future economic and credit market conditions and our
    ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make
    planned expenditures;

•

restrictions and limitations in the agreements governing our
    senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness;

•

significant competition with respect to destination travel
    locations generally and with respect to our peers in the
    industries in which we compete;

•

the fact that we are subject to extensive regulation and the
    related cost of compliance or failure to comply with such
    regulations;

•

economic and market conditions in the markets in which we
    operate and in the locations in which our customers reside;

•

extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property
    damage or interrupt business;

•

the concentration of our major gaming resorts on the Las Vegas
    Strip;



•

investing through partnerships or joint ventures including
    CityCenter and MGM Macau decreases our ability to manage risk;

•

our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a
    rise in energy prices;

•

leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, are
    particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as
    terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility;

•

we extend credit to a significant portion of our customers and
    we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit
    players;

•

our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible
    losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our
    insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain
    similar insurance coverage in the future;

•

plans for future construction can be affected by a number of
    factors, including timing delays and legal challenges;

•

the outcome of pending and potential future litigation claims
    against us;

•

the fact that Tracinda Corporation (“Tracinda”) owns a
    significant amount of our common stock and may have interests
    that differ from the interests of other holders of our stock;

•

a significant portion of our labor force is covered by
    collective bargaining agreements; and

•

risks associated with doing business outside of the United
    States.

Any forward-looking statement made by us in this

Form 10-K

or our 2010 Annual Report speaks only as of the date on which it
    is made. Factors or events that could cause our actual results
    to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible
    for us to predict all of them. We undertake no obligation to
    publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a
    result of new information, future developments or otherwise,
    except as may be required by law.

You should also be aware that while we from time to time
    communicate with securities analysts, we do not disclose to them
    any material non-public information, internal forecasts or other
    confidential business information. Therefore, you should not
    assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any
    analyst, irrespective of the content of the statement or report.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events
    described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any
    other of our filings with the SEC could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows. Additional risks and uncertainties
    not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be
    immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our
    business, financial positions, results of operations or cash
    flows. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among
    other things, the risks described below.

Risks
    Related to our Substantial Indebtedness

•

Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial
    commitments could adversely affect our operations and financial
    results and impact our ability to satisfy our
    obligations.

As of December 31, 2010, we had
    approximately $12.3 billion of indebtedness, including
    $2.3 billion of borrowings outstanding under our senior
    credit facility, and had approximately $1.2 billion of
    available borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility.
    We have no other existing sources of borrowing availability,
    except to the extent we pay down further amounts outstanding
    under the senior credit facility. We have approximately
    $455 million of 2011 note maturities and estimated interest
    payments of $969 million in 2011 based on outstanding debt
    as of December 31, 2010. Any increase in the interest rates
    applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase
    the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available
    to fund our other liquidity needs. See “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations” for discussion of our liquidity and financial
    position. In addition, our substantial indebtedness and
    significant financial commitments could have important negative
    consequences, including:

-

increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry
    conditions;

-

limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in
    our business and industry;

-

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds;

-

making it more difficult for us to make payments on our
    indebtedness; and

-

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other less
    leveraged competitors.

Moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned
    and managed properties to remain attractive and competitive we
    must periodically invest significant capital to keep the
    properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished, which
    requires an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we
    cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations,
    funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Similarly, future
    development projects and acquisitions could require significant
    capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt,
    guarantees of third-party debt, or the incurrence of contingent
    liabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business,
    financial condition and results of operations. Events over the
    past several years, including the failures and near failures of
    financial services companies and the decrease in liquidity and
    available capital, have negatively affected the capital markets.

•

Current and future economic and credit market conditions
    could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our
    indebtedness and to make planned expenditures.

Our
    ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness
    and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and
    investments in joint ventures, such as CityCenter, depends on
    our ability to generate cash flow in the future and our ability
    to borrow under our senior credit facility to the extent of
    available borrowings. If adverse regional and national economic
    conditions persist, worsen, or fail to improve significantly, we
    could experience decreased revenues from our operations
    attributable to decreases in consumer spending levels and could
    fail to generate sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or
    fail to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants
    which we are subject to under our indebtedness. We cannot assure
    you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from
    operations or that future borrowings will be available to us
    under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to
    enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity
    needs.

We have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2013
    and 2014 and thereafter. Our ability to timely refinance and
    replace such indebtedness will depend upon the foregoing as well
    as on continued and sustained improvements in financial markets.
    If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely
    basis, we might



be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of
    certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other
    investments. There is no assurance that any of these
    alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on
    satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous
    to note holders, or on terms that would not require us to breach
    the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt
    agreements.

•

The agreements governing our senior credit facility and other
    senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that
    could significantly affect our ability to operate our business,
    as well as significantly affect our liquidity and therefore
    could adversely affect our results of operations.

Covenants
    governing our senior credit facility and certain of our debt
    securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:

-

pay dividends or distributions, repurchase or issue equity,
    prepay debt or make certain investments;

-

incur additional debt or issue certain disqualified stock and
    preferred stock;

-

incur liens on assets;

-

pledge or sell assets or consolidate with another company or
    sell all or substantially all assets;

-

enter into transactions with affiliates;

-

allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets; and

-

enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by
    events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or
    obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a
    default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger
    acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger
    cross defaults under other agreements governing our long-term
    indebtedness. Any default under the senior credit facility or
    the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect
    our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations
    and our ability to make payments on our debt, and could force us
    to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.

Risks
    Related to our Business

•

We face significant competition with respect to destination
    travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the
    industries in which we compete, and failure to effectively
    compete could materially adversely affect our business,
    financial condition results of operations and cash
    flow.

The hotel, resort and casino industries are
    highly competitive. We do not believe that our competition is
    limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort and
    gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our
    customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or
    hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination
    locations, competition will increase. Major competitors,
    including new entrants, have either recently expanded their
    hotel room capacity or are currently expanding their capacity or
    constructing new resorts in Las Vegas and Macau. Also, the
    growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas, including
    California, has increased the competition faced by our
    operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. In particular, as large
    scale gaming operations in Native American tribal lands has
    increased, particularly in California, competition has
    increased. In addition, competition could increase if changes in
    gaming restrictions in the U.S. and elsewhere result in the
    addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our
    customers than our casinos, such as has happened in California.
    In addition to competition with other hotels, resorts, and
    casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of
    the markets in which we operate. Our failure to compete
    successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract
    customers could adversely affect our business, financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flow.

•

Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the
    cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations
    may adversely affect our business and results of
    operations.

Our ownership and operation of gaming
    facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries,
    states, and provinces in which we operate. These laws,
    regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to
    jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility,
    financial stability and character of the owners and managers of
    gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or
    involved in gaming operations. As such, our gaming regulators
    can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or
    business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or,
    alternatively,



cease operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, unsuitable
    activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign
    unconsolidated affiliates in any jurisdiction could have a
    negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other
    jurisdictions. For a summary of gaming and other regulations
    that affect our business, see “Regulation and
    Licensing.” The regulatory environment in any particular
    jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could
    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In
    addition, we are subject to various gaming taxes, which are
    subject to possible increase at any time. Increases in gaming
    taxation could also adversely affect our results.

Further, our directors, officers, key employees and joint
    venture partners must meet approval standards of certain state
    regulatory authorities. If state regulatory authorities were to
    find a person occupying any such position or a joint venture
    partner unsuitable, we would be required to sever our
    relationship with that person or the joint venture partner may
    be required to dispose of their interest in the joint venture.
    State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the
    conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key
    employees or joint venture partners to ensure compliance with
    applicable standards. For example, as a result of the New Jersey
    Division of Gaming Enforcement (the “DGE”)
    investigation of our relationship with our joint venture partner
    in Macau we entered into a settlement agreement with the DGE
    under which we were required to sell our 50% ownership interest
    in Borgata and related leased land in Atlantic City.

Certain public and private issuances of securities and other
    transactions that we are party to also require the approval of
    some state regulatory authorities.

In addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to
    various federal, state and local laws and regulations affecting
    businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but
    are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning
    alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees,
    currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and
    marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could
    change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new
    laws and regulations could be enacted. For example, Illinois has
    enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places, including
    bars, restaurants, work places, schools and casinos. The
    likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other
    jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted,
    though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact
    our financial performance.

•

Our business is affected by economic and market conditions in
    the markets in which we operate and in the locations in which
    our customers reside.

Our business is particularly
    sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and
    corporate spending on conventions and business development.
    Economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by
    our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause
    a decline in demand for hotel and casino resorts, trade shows
    and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer.
    In addition, changes in discretionary consumer spending or
    consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the
    increased cost of travel, an unstable job market, perceived or
    actual disposable consumer income and wealth, or fears of war
    and future acts of terrorism. Aria, Bellagio, MGM Grand Las
    Vegas, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage in particular may be affected
    by economic conditions in the Far East, and all of our Nevada
    resorts are affected by economic conditions in the United
    States, and California in particular. A recession, economic
    slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting
    consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a
    reduction in visitation to our resorts, which would adversely
    affect our operating results. For example, the recent recession
    and downturn in consumer and corporate spending has had a
    negative impact on our results of operations. In addition, the
    weak housing and real estate market — both generally
    and in Nevada particularly — has negatively impacted
    CityCenter’s ability to sell residential units.

•

Extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause
    property damage or interrupt business, which could harm our
    business and results of operations.

Certain of our
    casino properties are located in areas that may be subject to
    extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to,
    hurricanes. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our
    operations, damage our properties, and reduce the number of
    customers who visit our facilities in such areas. Although we
    maintain both property and business interruption insurance
    coverage for certain extreme weather conditions, such coverage
    is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits,
    including limitation on the coverage period for business
    interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to
    fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims
    resulting from such



extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, such extreme weather
    conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected
    properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to
    decrease for an indefinite period.

•

Because our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las
    Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming
    company that is more geographically diversified.

Given
    that our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip,
    our business may be significantly affected by risks common to
    the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and
    availability of air services and the impact of any events which
    disrupt air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect
    our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of
    flights into or out of Las Vegas, but we rely on air traffic for
    a significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by
    major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices and lower
    demand can impact the number of visitors to our resorts.
    Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between
    Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large number of our
    customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any
    other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of
    customers who visit our facilities.

•

Investing through partnerships or joint ventures including
    CityCenter and MGM Macau decreases our ability to manage
    risk.

In addition to acquiring or developing hotels and
    resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business
    directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to
    continue to invest, as a co-venturer. Joint venturers often have
    shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets.
    Therefore, the operation of a joint venture is subject to
    inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the
    need to reach agreements on material matters. In addition, joint
    venture investments may involve risks such as the possibility
    that the co-venturer in an investment might become bankrupt or
    not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or
    have economic or business interests or goals that are
    inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a
    position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests
    or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions
    by a co-venturer might subject hotels and resorts owned by the
    joint venture to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to
    take action without the approval of our joint venture partners.
    Alternatively, our joint venture partners could take actions
    binding on the joint venture without our consent. Additionally,
    should a joint venture partner become bankrupt, we could become
    liable for our partner’s or co-venturer’s share of
    joint venture liabilities.

For instance, CityCenter, which is 50% owned and managed by us,
    has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely
    affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. If
    CityCenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we
    and our partners are unable to support future funding
    requirements, as necessary, such event could have adverse
    financial consequences to us. In addition, the agreements
    governing the indebtedness subject CityCenter and its
    subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive
    covenants, including restrictions on its ability to incur
    additional indebtedness, place liens upon assets, make
    distributions to us, make certain investments, consummate
    certain asset sales, enter into transactions with affiliates
    (including us) and merge or consolidate with any other person or
    sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of
    all or substantially all of its assets. The CityCenter amended
    and restated credit facility also requires CityCenter to meet an
    interest coverage ratio test commencing on September 30,
    2012. We cannot be sure that CityCenter will be able to meet
    this test or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the
    test.

In addition, in accordance with our joint venture agreement and
    the CityCenter credit facility, we provided a cost overrun
    guarantee which is secured by our interests in the assets of
    Circus Circus Las Vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land.

Also, the operation of MGM Macau, which is 50% owned by us, is
    subject to unique risks, including risks related to:
    (a) our ability to adapt to the different regulatory and
    gaming environment in Macau while remaining in compliance with
    the requirements of the gaming regulatory authorities in the
    jurisdictions in which we currently operate, as well as other
    applicable federal, state, or local laws in the United States
    and Macau; (b) potential political or economic instability;
    and (c) the extreme weather conditions in the region.

•

Our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a
    rise in energy prices could harm our operating
    results.

We are a large consumer of electricity and
    other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly,
    increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our
    operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline
    prices which affect our customers may result in reduced
    visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues.



•

Leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, are
    particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as
    terrorist attacks or acts of war or hostility.

We are
    dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air.
    Since most of our customers travel by air to our Las Vegas and
    Macau properties, any terrorist act, outbreak of hostilities,
    escalation of war, or any actual or perceived threat to the
    security of travel by air, could adversely affect our financial
    condition, results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore,
    although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage
    for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against
    loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms
    of terrorism continues to be unavailable.

•

We extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we
    may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit
    players.

We conduct our gaming activities on a credit
    and cash basis. Any such credit we extend is unsecured. Table
    games players typically are extended more credit than slot
    players, and high-stakes players typically are extended more
    credit than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end
    gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and
    variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming
    may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow
    and earnings in a particular quarter. We extend credit to those
    customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant,
    in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These
    large receivables could have a significant impact on our results
    of operations if deemed uncollectible. While gaming debts
    evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly
    referred to as a “marker,” and judgments on gaming
    debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and
    Nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states
    under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the
    U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that
    enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although
    courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts
    directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may
    be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from
    U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign
    nations.

•

Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all
    possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition,
    our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to
    obtain similar insurance coverage in the
    future.

Although we have “all risk” property
    insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers
    damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural
    disasters, acts of war, or terrorism), each policy has certain
    exclusions. In addition, our property insurance coverage is in
    an amount that may be significantly less than the expected
    replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a
    total loss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be
    adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty.
    In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes,
    nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation
    of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism,
    deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage and
    pollution, may not be covered at all under our policies.
    Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured
    losses.

In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty
    loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these
    events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be
    injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption
    insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may
    not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event.

We renew our insurance policies (other than our builder’s
    risk insurance) on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may
    become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy
    limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.

•

We face risks related to pending claims that have been, or
    future claims that may be, brought against us.

Claims
    have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various
    legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise
    from time to time. We may not be successful in the defense or
    prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which
    could result in settlements or damages that could significantly
    impact our business, financial condition and results of
    operations. Please see the further discussion in Item 3.
    “Legal Proceedings.”

•

Tracinda owns a significant amount of our common stock and
    may have interests that differ from the interests of other
    holders of our stock.

As of December 31, 2010,
    Tracinda beneficially owned approximately 27% of our outstanding
    common stock. Should Tracinda and its affiliates collectively
    cease to own more than 15% of our outstanding common stock, such
    an event will constitute a “change of control” under
    the indentures governing



certain of our outstanding secured notes. In that event, we
    would be required to offer to purchase those notes at 101% of
    the outstanding principal amount of those notes.

In addition, Tracinda may be able to exercise significant
    influence over us as a result of its significant ownership of
    our outstanding common stock. As a result, actions requiring
    stockholder approval that may be supported by other stockholders
    could be effectively blocked by Tracinda.

•

A significant portion of our labor force is covered by
    collective bargaining agreements.

Work stoppages and
    other labor problems could negatively affect our business and
    results of operations. Approximately 30,000 of our
    61,000 employees are covered by collective bargaining
    agreements. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees could
    have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, wage and
    or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be
    significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results
    of operations and to the extent that our non-union employees
    join unions, we would have greater exposure to risks associated
    with labor problems. The majority of our collective bargaining
    agreements expire in 2012.

•

We are subject to risks associated with doing business
    outside of the United States.

Our operations outside
    the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in
    conducting business under

non-United

States laws, regulations and customs. In particular, the risks
    associated with the operation of MGM Macau, which is 50% owned
    by us, or any future operations in which we may engage in any
    other foreign territories, include:

-

changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies
    in Macau;

-

changes in

non-United

States government programs;

-

possible failure to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the
    United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar
    anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;

-

general economic conditions and policies in China, including
    restrictions on travel and currency movements;

-

difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing

non-United

States operations;

-

different labor regulations;

-

changes in environmental, health and safety laws;

-

potentially negative consequences from changes in or
    interpretations of tax laws;

-

political instability and actual or anticipated military or
    political conflicts;

-

economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate
    fluctuations; and

-

uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.

These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an
    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial
    condition. For example, we are subject to compliance with the
    United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar
    anti-bribery laws, which generally prohibit companies and their
    intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign
    government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining
    business. While our employees and agents are required to comply
    with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies
    and procedures will always protect us from violations of these
    laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate
    ethics. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our
    operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money
    laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering
    laws or regulations by any of our properties could have an
    adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations
    or cash flows. The occurrence or allegation of these types of
    risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects,
    value, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are also exposed to a variety of market risks, including the
    effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the
    United States dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies
    of other countries, our United States dollar reported income
    from sources where revenue is dominated in the currencies of
    other such countries will decrease.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

CityCenter construction litigation.

In March 2010,
    Perini Building Company, Inc., general contractor for the
    CityCenter development project (the “Project”), filed
    a lawsuit in the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark
    County, State of Nevada, against MGM MIRAGE Design Group (a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which was the original
    party to the Perini construction agreement) and certain direct
    or indirect subsidiaries of CityCenter Holdings, LLC (the
    “CityCenter Owners”). Perini asserts that the Project
    was substantially completed, but the defendants failed to pay
    Perini approximately $490 million allegedly due and owing
    under the construction agreement for labor, equipment and
    materials expended on the Project. The complaint further charges
    the defendants with failure to provide timely and complete
    design documents, late delivery to Perini of design changes,
    mismanagement of the change order process, obstruction of
    Perini’s ability to complete the Harmon Hotel &
    Spa component, and fraudulent inducement of Perini to compromise
    significantly amounts due for its general conditions. The
    complaint advances claims for breach of contract, breach of the
    implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious breach
    of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust
    enrichment and promissory estoppel, and fraud and intentional
    misrepresentation. Perini seeks compensatory damages, punitive
    damages, attorneys’ fees and costs.



In April 2010, Perini served an amended complaint in this case
    which joins as defendants many owners of CityCenter residential
    condominium units (the “Condo Owner Defendants”), adds
    a count for foreclosure of Perini’s recorded master
    mechanic’s lien against the CityCenter property in the
    amount of approximately $491 million, and asserts the
    priority of this mechanic’s lien over the interests of the
    CityCenter Owners, the Condo Owner Defendants and the Project
    lenders in the CityCenter property.

The CityCenter Owners and the other defendants dispute
    Perini’s allegations, and contend that the defendants are
    entitled to substantial amounts from Perini, including offsets
    against amounts claimed to be owed to Perini and its
    subcontractors and damages based on breach of their contractual
    and other duties to CityCenter, duplicative payment requests,
    non-conforming work, lack of proof of alleged work performance,
    defective work related to the Harmon Hotel & Spa
    component, property damage and Perini’s failure to perform
    its obligations to pay Project subcontractors and to prevent
    filing of liens against the Project. Parallel to the court
    litigation CityCenter management conducted an extra-judicial
    program for settlement of Project subcontractor claims.
    CityCenter has resolved the claims of the majority of the 223
    first-tier subcontractors, with only several remaining for
    further proceedings along with trial of Perini’s claims and
    CityCenter’s Harmon-related counterclaim and other claims
    by CityCenter against Perini and its parent guarantor, Tutor
    Perini. In December 2010, Perini recorded an amended notice of
    lien reducing its lien to approximately $313 million.

The CityCenter Owners and the other defendants will continue to
    vigorously assert and protect their interests in the lawsuit.
    The range of loss beyond the claims asserted to date by Perini
    or any gain the joint venture may realize related to the
    defendants’ counterclaims cannot be reasonably estimated at
    this time.

Securities and derivative litigation.

In 2009
    various shareholders filed six lawsuits in Nevada federal and
    state court against the Company and various of its former and
    current directors and officers alleging federal securities laws
    violations

and/or

related breaches of fiduciary duties in connection with
    statements allegedly made by the defendants during the period
    August 2007 through the date of such lawsuit filings. In
    general, the lawsuits assert the same or similar allegations,
    including that during the relevant period defendants
    artificially inflated the Company’s common stock price by
    knowingly making materially false and misleading statements and
    omissions to the investing public about the Company’s
    financial statements and condition, operations, CityCenter, and
    the intrinsic value of the Company’s common stock; that
    these alleged misstatements and omissions thereby enabled
    certain Company insiders to derive personal profit from the sale
    of Company common stock to the public; that defendants caused
    plaintiffs and other shareholders to purchase Company common
    stock at artificially inflated prices; and that defendants
    imprudently implemented a share repurchase program to the
    detriment of the Company. The lawsuits seek unspecified
    compensatory damages, restitution and disgorgement of alleged
    profits, injunctive relief related to corporate governance

and/or

attorneys’ fees and costs.

The lawsuits are:

In re MGM MIRAGE Securities Litigation

, Case

No. 2:09-cv-01558-GMN-LRL.

In November 2009, the U.S. District Court for Nevada
    consolidated the Robert Lowinger v. MGM MIRAGE, et al.
    (Case

No. 2:09-cv-01558-RCL-LRL,

filed August 19, 2009) and Khachatur
    Hovhannisyan v. MGM MIRAGE, et al. (Case

No. 2:09-cv-02011-LRH-RJJ,

filed October 19, 2009) putative class actions under
    the caption “In re MGM MIRAGE Securities
    Litigation.” The cases name the Company and certain former
    and current directors and officers as defendants and allege
    violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

promulgated thereunder. These cases were transferred in July
    2010 to the Honorable Gloria M. Navarro. In October 2010 the
    court appointed several employee retirement benefits funds as
    co-lead plaintiffs and their counsel as co-lead and co-liaison
    counsel. In January 2011, lead plaintiffs filed a consolidated
    amended complaint, alleging that between August 2, 2007 and
    March 5, 2009, the Company, its directors and certain of
    its officers artificially inflated the market price of the
    Company’s securities by knowingly making materially false
    and misleading public statements and omissions concerning the
    Company’s financial condition, its liquidity, its access to
    credit, and the costs and progress of construction of the
    CityCenter development. The consolidated amended complaint
    asserts violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and

Rule 10b-5

thereunder. These cases remain pending before the court. The
    Company and the other defendants have yet to answer and plan to
    file motions to dismiss the cases.



Mario Guerrero v. James J. Murren, et al.

(Case

No. 2:09-cv-01815-KJD-RJJ,

filed September 14, 2009, U.S. District Court for the
    District of Nevada). This purported shareholder derivative
    action against certain of the Company’s former and current
    directors and officers alleges, among other things, breach of
    fiduciary duty by defendants’ asserted improper financial
    reporting, insider selling and misappropriation of information;
    and unjust enrichment. The Company is named as a nominal
    defendant. Plaintiff’s joint motion with the

Shamberger

plaintiff (see below), filed in October 2009
    and renewed in June 2010, to consolidate this case with the

Shamberger

case and to appoint lead plaintiffs and lead
    counsel remains pending. This case otherwise remains pending
    before the court.

Regina Shamberger v. J. Terrence Lanni, et
    al.

(Case

No. 2:09-cv-01817-PMP-GWF,

filed September 14, 2009, U.S. District Court for the
    District of Nevada). This purported shareholder derivative
    action against certain of the Company’s former and current
    directors and officers alleges, among other things, breach of
    fiduciary duty by defendants’ asserted insider selling and
    misappropriation of information; waste of corporate assets; and
    unjust enrichment. The Company is named as a nominal defendant.
    See

Guerrero

immediately above. This case otherwise
    remains pending before the court.

Charles Kim v. James J. Murren, et al.

(Case

No. A-09-599937-C,

filed September 23, 2009, Eighth Judicial District Court,
    Clark County, Nevada). This purported shareholder derivative
    action against certain of the Company’s former and current
    directors and officers alleges, among other things, breach of
    fiduciary duty by defendants’ asserted dissemination of
    false and misleading statements to the public, failure to
    maintain internal controls, and failure to properly oversee and
    manage the Company; unjust enrichment; abuse of control; gross
    mismanagement; and waste of corporate assets. The Company is
    named as a nominal defendant. This case remains pending before
    the court. See below.

Sanjay Israni v. Robert H. Baldwin, et
    al.

(Case

No. CV-09-02914,

filed September 25, 2009, Second Judicial District Court,
    Washoe County, Nevada). This purported shareholder derivative
    action against certain of the Company’s former and current
    directors and a Company officer alleges, among other things,
    breach of fiduciary duty by defendants’ asserted insider
    selling and misappropriation of information; abuse of control;
    gross mismanagement; waste of corporate assets; unjust
    enrichment; and contribution and indemnification. The Company is
    named as a nominal defendant. In May 2010, plaintiffs amended
    the complaint to, among other things, allege as additional bases
    for their claims defendants’ approval of the Company’s
    joint venture with Pansy Ho at MGM Macau. In May 2010 the Second
    Judicial District Court in Washoe County transferred this case
    to the Eighth Judicial District Court in Clark County, Nevada
    (Case No. A-10-619411-C), and in September 2010 the latter court
    consolidated this action with the Charles Kim v. James J.
    Murren, et al. shareholder derivative action, Case

No. A-09-599937-C.

In December 2010 and January 2011 the Company and its directors
    filed motions with the court to dismiss the derivative
    complaints in the Israni and Kim cases. The motion is scheduled
    for hearing in April 2011.

The Company will continue to vigorously defend itself against
    these claims.

Other

We and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other
    lawsuits, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to
    our business. We do not believe that the outcome of such pending
    litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a material
    adverse effect on the Company.

There were approximately 4,436 record holders of our common
    stock as of February 18, 2011.

We have not paid dividends on our common stock in the last two
    fiscal years. As a holding company with no independent
    operations, our ability to pay dividends will depend upon the
    receipt of dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries.
    Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains financial
    covenants that could restrict our ability to pay dividends and
    our senior credit facility and secured notes indentures contain
    restrictive covenants that limit our ability to pay dividends,
    subject to certain exceptions. Our Board of Directors
    periodically reviews our policy with respect to dividends, and
    any determination to pay dividends in the future will depend on
    our financial position, future capital requirements and
    financial debt covenants and any other factors deemed necessary
    by the Board of Directors. Moreover, should we pay any dividends
    in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue
    to pay such dividends.

Share
    Repurchases

Our share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase
    programs approved by our Board of Directors and publicly
    announced. We did not repurchase shares of our common stock
    during the quarter and year ended December 31, 2010. The
    maximum number of shares available for repurchase under our May
    2008 repurchase program was 20 million as of
    December 31, 2010.

comparability of the selected financial data presented above:

Acquisitions and Dispositions

•

In April 2007, we sold the Primm Valley Resorts.

•

In June 2007, we sold the Colorado Belle and Edgewater resorts
    in Laughlin, Nevada (the “Laughlin Properties”).

•

In 2007, we recognized a $1.03 billion pre-tax gain on the
    contribution of CityCenter to a joint venture.

•

In March 2009, we sold the Treasure Island casino resort
    (“TI”) in Las Vegas, Nevada and recorded a gain on the
    sale of $187 million.

The results of the Primm Valley Resorts and the Laughlin
    Properties are classified as discontinued operations for all
    applicable periods presented, including the gain on sales of
    such assets. The results of TI are not recorded as discontinued
    operations, as we believe significant customer migration
    occurred between TI and our other Las Vegas Strip resorts.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

The following narrative provides information about our
    liquidity, financial position, results of operations and other
    factors affecting our current and future operating results.

Executive
    Overview

Current
    Operations

At December 31, 2010, our operations primarily consisted of
    15 wholly-owned casino resorts and 50% investments in four other
    casino resorts.

Las Vegas, Nevada:

CityCenter (50% owned and managed by us), Bellagio, MGM Grand
    Las

Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay, The Mirage,
    Luxor, New York-New York, Excalibur, Monte Carlo and
    Circus Circus Las Vegas.

Other:

Circus Circus Reno and Silver Legacy (50% owned) in Reno,
    Nevada;

Gold Strike in Jean, Nevada; Railroad Pass in Henderson, Nevada;
    MGM

Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi,
    Mississippi and

Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Grand Victoria (50%
    owned) in

Elgin, Illinois; and MGM Macau (50% owned).

Other operations include the Shadow Creek golf course in North
    Las Vegas and Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi. We
    also own the Primm Valley Golf Club at the California state
    line, which is currently operated by a third party under a lease
    agreement.

The other 50% of CityCenter is owned by Infinity World
    Development Corp (“Infinity World”), a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates
    government decree entity. CityCenter consists of Aria, a
    4,004-room casino resort; Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas, a
    392-room non-gaming boutique hotel; Crystals, a retail district
    with 334,000 of currently leaseable square feet; and Vdara, a
    1,495-room luxury condominium-hotel. In addition, CityCenter
    features residential units in the Residences at Mandarin
    Oriental – 225 units and Veer –
    669 units. Aria, Vdara, Mandarin Oriental and Crystals all
    opened in December 2009 and the sales of residential units
    within CityCenter began closing in early 2010. We receive a
    management fee of 2% of revenues for the management of Aria and
    Vdara, and 5% of EBITDA (as defined in the agreements governing
    our management of Aria and Vdara). In addition, we receive an
    annual fee of $3 million for the management of Crystals.

Liquidity
    and Financial Position

We completed a series of capital markets transactions during
    2010 and extended our senior credit facility. As a result of
    these transactions, we believe we will have sufficient liquidity
    from expected future cash flows and availability under our
    senior credit facility to meet our financial obligations through
    2012. We have significant indebtedness and continue to evaluate
    opportunities to improve our financial condition, but we can
    provide no assurance that we will be able to repay or
    effectively refinance our indebtedness in future periods.

Capital Markets Transactions.

We completed the
    following transactions during 2010:

•

In March 2010, we issued $845 million of 9% senior
    secured notes due 2020 for net proceeds to us of approximately
    $826 million;

•

In April 2010, we issued $1.15 billion of 4.25% convertible
    senior notes due 2015 for net proceeds to us of
    $1.12 billion;

•

In October 2010, we issued 40.9 million shares of our
    common stock for total net proceeds to us of approximately
    $512 million. The underwriter exercised their overallotment
    option to purchase an additional 6.1 million shares from us
    in November 2010 and we received an additional approximately
    $76 million of net proceeds; and

•

In October 2010, we issued $500 million of 10% senior
    notes due 2016, issued at a discount to yield 10.25%, for net
    proceeds to us of approximately $486 million.



Senior Credit Facility.

Our senior credit facility
    was amended and restated in March 2010, and consisted of
    approximately $2.7 billion in term loans (of which
    approximately $874 million was required to be repaid by
    October 3, 2011) and a $2.0 billion revolving
    loan (of which approximately $302 million was required to
    be repaid by October 3, 2011). As discussed below, in
    November 2010 we repaid the outstanding balance of the loans
    maturing in 2011. As of December 31, 2010, our senior
    credit facility consisted of approximately $1.8 billion in
    term loans and $1.7 billion in revolving loans, and had
    approximately $1.2 billion of available revolving borrowing
    capacity.

We accounted for the modification related to extending the term
    loans as an extinguishment of debt because the applicable cash
    flows under the extended term loans are more than 10% different
    from the applicable cash flows under the previous loans.
    Therefore, the extended term loans were recorded at fair value
    resulting in a $181 million gain and a discount of
    $181 million to be amortized to interest expense over the
    term of the extended term loans. For the twelve months ended
    December 31, 2010, we recorded $31 million of interest
    related to the amortization of this discount. Fair value of the
    estimated term loans was based on trading prices immediately
    after the transaction. In addition, we wrote off
    $15 million of existing debt issuance costs related to the
    previous term loans and had expense of $22 million for new
    debt issuance costs incurred related to amounts paid to
    extending term loan lenders in connection with the modification.
    We also wrote off $2 million of existing debt issuance
    costs related to the reduction in capacity under the
    non-extending revolving portion of the senior credit facility.
    In total, we recognized a net pre-tax gain on extinguishment of
    debt of $142 million in “Other, net”
    non-operating income in the first quarter of 2010.

Because net proceeds from our October 2010 common stock offering
    were in excess of $500 million, we were required to ratably
    repay indebtedness under the senior credit facility of
    $6 million, which equaled 50% of such excess. We used the
    net proceeds from our October 2010 senior notes offering
    discussed above and a portion of the net proceeds from our
    October 2010 common stock offering to repay the remaining
    amounts owed to non-extending lenders under our senior credit
    facility. Loans and revolving commitments aggregating
    approximately $3.6 billion were extended to
    February 21, 2014. In November 2010, the underwriters of
    our common stock offering exercised their overallotment option
    and purchased an additional 6.1 million shares for net
    proceeds to us of $76 million, 50% of which was used to
    ratably repay indebtedness under the senior credit facility. As
    a result of these transactions we recorded a pre-tax loss on
    retirement of debt related to unamortized debt issuance costs
    and discounts of $9 million recorded in “Other,
    net” non-operating income in the fourth quarter of 2010.

The restated senior credit facility allows us to refinance
    indebtedness maturing prior to February 21, 2014, but
    limits our ability to prepay later maturing indebtedness until
    the extended facilities are paid in full. We may issue unsecured
    debt, equity-linked and equity securities to refinance our
    outstanding indebtedness; however, we are required to use net
    proceeds (a) from indebtedness issued in amounts in excess
    of $250 million over amounts used to refinance indebtedness
    and (b) from equity issued, other than in exchange for our
    indebtedness, in amounts in excess of $500 million (which
    limit we reached with our October 2010 stock offering) to
    ratably prepay the credit facilities, in each case, in an amount
    equal to 50% of the net cash proceeds of such excess.

Borgata

In its June 2005 report to the New Jersey Casino Control
    Commission (the “CCC”), on the application of Borgata
    for renewal of its casino license, the New Jersey Division of
    Gaming Enforcement (the “DGE”) stated that it was
    conducting an investigation of our relationship with our joint
    venture partner in Macau and that the DGE would report to the
    CCC any material information it deemed appropriate.

On May 18, 2009, the DGE issued a report to the CCC on its
    investigation. In the report, the DGE recommended, among other
    things, that: (i) our Macau joint venture partner be found
    to be unsuitable; (ii) we be directed to disengage
    ourselves from any business association with our Macau joint
    venture partner; (iii) our due diligence/compliance efforts
    were found to be deficient; and (iv) the CCC hold a hearing
    to address the report. In March 2010, the CCC approved our
    settlement agreement with the DGE pursuant to which we placed
    our 50% ownership interest in the Borgata Hotel
    Casino & Spa (“Borgata”) and related leased
    land in Atlantic City into a divestiture trust. Following the
    transfer of these interests into trust, we ceased to be
    regulated by the CCC or the DGE, except as otherwise provided by
    the trust agreement and the settlement agreement. Boyd Gaming
    Corporation (“Boyd”), who owns the other 50% interest,
    is not affected by the settlement.



The terms of the settlement mandate the sale of the trust
    property within a

30-month

period ending in September 2012. During the 18 months
    ending in September 2011, we have the right to direct the
    trustee to sell the trust property, subject to approval of the
    CCC. If a sale is not concluded by that time, the trustee is
    responsible for selling the trust property during the following

12-month

period. Prior to the consummation of the sale, the divestiture
    trust will retain any cash flows received in respect of the
    trust property, but will pay property taxes and other costs
    attributable to the trust property. We are the sole economic
    beneficiary of the trust and will be permitted to reapply for a
    New Jersey gaming license beginning 30 months after the
    completion of the sale of the trust assets. As of
    December 31, 2010, the trust has $188 million of cash
    and investments of which $150 million is held in treasury
    securities with maturities greater than 90 days and is
    recorded within “Prepaid expenses and other.”

As a result of our ownership interest in Borgata being placed
    into a trust we no longer have significant influence over
    Borgata; therefore, we discontinued the equity method of
    accounting for Borgata at the point the assets were placed in
    the trust, and account for our rights under the trust agreement
    under the cost method of accounting. We also reclassified the
    carrying value of our investment related to Borgata to
    “Other long-term assets, net.” Earnings and losses
    that relate to the investment that were previously accrued
    remain as a part of the carrying amount of the investment.
    Distributions received by the trust that do not exceed our share
    of earnings are recognized currently in earnings. However,
    distributions to the trust that exceed our share of earnings for
    such periods are applied to reduce the carrying amount of our
    investment. The trust received net distributions from the joint
    venture of $113 million for the year ended
    December 31, 2010. We recorded $94 million as a
    reduction of the carrying value and $19 million was
    recorded as “Other, net” non-operating income for the
    year ended December 31, 2010.

In connection with the settlement agreement discussed above, we
    entered into an amendment to our joint venture agreement with
    Boyd to permit the transfer of our 50% ownership interest into
    trust in connection with our settlement agreement with the DGE.
    In accordance with such agreement, Boyd received a priority
    partnership distribution of approximately $31 million
    (equal to the excess prior capital contributions by Boyd) upon
    successful refinancing of the Borgata credit facility in August
    2010.

In July 2010, we entered into an agreement to sell four
    long-term ground leases and their respective underlying real
    property parcels, approximately 11 acres, underlying the
    Borgata. The transaction closed in November 2010; the trust
    received net proceeds of $71 million and we recorded a gain
    of $3 million related to the sale in “Property
    transactions, net.”

In October 2010, we received an offer for our 50% economic
    interest in the Borgata based on an enterprise value of
    $1.35 billion for the entire asset and in October, 2010,
    our Board of Directors authorized submission of this offer to
    Boyd in accordance with the right of first refusal provisions
    included in the joint venture agreement. Subsequently, Boyd
    announced that it does not intend to exercise its right of
    refusal in connection with such offer. Based on Borgata’s
    September debt balances, the offer equated to approximately
    $250 million for our 50% interest. This was less than the
    carrying value of our investment in Borgata; therefore, we
    recorded an impairment charge of approximately $128 million
    at September 30, 2010, recorded in “Property
    transactions, net.” Since October 2010, we have continued
    to negotiate with the prospective purchaser as well as other
    parties that have expressed interest in the asset. There can be
    no assurance that the transaction will be completed as proposed
    or at all, and the final terms of any sale may differ materially
    from the ones disclosed above.

Effect of
    Economic Factors on Results of Operations

The state of the U.S. economy has negatively affected our
    results of operations over the past several years, and we expect
    to continue to be sensitive to certain aspects of the current
    economic conditions, including, for example, high unemployment
    and the weak housing market. The decrease in liquidity in the
    credit markets which began in late 2007 and accelerated in late
    2008 also significantly affected our results of operations and
    financial condition.

Uncertain economic conditions continue to affect our operating
    results, as businesses and consumers have altered their spending
    patterns which led to decreases in visitor volumes and customer
    spending. Businesses responded to the difficult economic
    conditions by reducing travel budgets. This factor, along with
    negative perceptions surrounding certain types of business
    travel, caused decreases in convention attendance in Las Vegas
    in 2009 and 2010. Convention and catering customers cancelled or
    postponed a significant number of events occurring



during 2009. Other conditions currently or recently present in
    the economic environment which tend to negatively affect our
    operating results include:

•

Weaknesses in employment and increases in unemployment;

•

Weak consumer confidence;

•

Weak housing market and significant declines in housing prices
    and related home equity; and

•

Decreases in airline capacity to Las Vegas.

Because of these economic conditions, we have increasingly
    focused on managing costs and continue to review all areas of
    operations for efficiencies. We continually manage staffing
    levels across all our resorts and have reduced our salaried
    management positions. We suspended company contributions to our
    401(k) plan and our nonqualified deferred compensation plans in
    2009, which remained suspended in 2009 and 2010. We reinstated a
    more limited 401(k) company contribution in 2011 and will
    continue to monitor the plan contributions as the economy
    changes.

Our results of operations are also affected by decisions we make
    related to our capital allocation, our access to capital, and
    our cost of capital – all of which are affected by the
    uncertain state of the global economy and the continued
    instability in the capital markets. For example, we will incur
    higher interest costs in connection with the amendments to our
    senior credit facility in 2009 and 2010. Also, our general cost
    of debt has increased over the past few years. These factors may
    affect our ability to access future capital and cause future
    borrowings to carry higher interest rates.

Impairment
    Charges

Investment in Borgata.

As previously noted, in
    October 2010 we received an offer equating to approximately
    $250 million for our 50% interest in the Borgata and our
    Board of Directors authorized submission of this offer to Boyd
    Gaming Corporation, who subsequently announced it did not intend
    to exercise its right of refusal. The proposed offer submitted
    was less than the carrying value of our investment in Borgata;
    therefore, we recorded an impairment charge of approximately
    $128 million in the third quarter of 2010 included in
    “Property transactions, net.”

Investment in CityCenter.

At September 30,
    2009, we reviewed our CityCenter investment for impairment using
    revised operating forecasts developed by CityCenter management
    late in the third quarter. In addition, the impairment charge
    related to CityCenter’s residential real estate under
    development discussed below further indicated that our
    investment may have experienced an

“other-than-temporary”

decline in value. Our discounted cash flow analysis for
    CityCenter included estimated future cash outflows for
    construction and maintenance expenditures and future cash
    inflows from operations, including residential sales. Based on
    our analysis, we determined the carrying value of our investment
    exceeded its fair value and we determined that the impairment
    was

“other-than-temporary.”

As a result, we recorded an impairment charge of
    $956 million included in “Property transactions,
    net.”

At June 30, 2010, we reviewed our CityCenter investment for
    impairment using revised operating forecasts developed by
    CityCenter management. Based on current and forecasted market
    conditions and because CityCenter’s results of operations
    through June 30, 2010 were below previous forecasts, and
    the revised operating forecasts were lower than previous
    forecasts, we concluded that we should review the carrying value
    of our investment. We determined that the carrying value of our
    investment exceeded our fair value determined using a discounted
    cash flow analysis and therefore an impairment was indicated. We
    intend to and believe we will be able to retain our investment
    in CityCenter; however, due to the extent of the shortfall and
    our assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering our
    investment, we determined that the impairment was

“other-than-temporary”

and recorded an impairment charge of $1.12 billion included
    in “Property transactions, net.”

At September 30, 2010, we recognized an increase of
    $232 million in our total net obligation under our
    CityCenter completion guarantee, and a corresponding increase in
    our investment in CityCenter. The increase primarily reflected a
    revision to prior estimates based on our assessment of the most
    current information derived from our close-out and litigation
    processes and does not reflect certain potential recoveries that
    CityCenter is pursuing as part of the litigation process. We
    completed an impairment review as of September 30, 2010 and
    as a



result recorded an additional impairment of $191 million in
    the third quarter of 2010 included in “Property
    transactions, net.”

The discounted cash flow analyses for our investment in
    CityCenter included estimated future cash inflows from
    operations, including residential sales, and estimated future
    cash outflows for capital expenditures. The June 2010 and
    September 2010 analyses used an 11% discount rate and a long
    term growth rate of 4% related to forecasted cash flows for
    CityCenter’s operating assets.

CityCenter Residential Inventory.

Included in loss
    from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended
    December 31, 2009 is our share of an impairment charge
    relating to CityCenter residential real estate under development
    (“REUD”). CityCenter was required to review its REUD
    for impairment as of September 30, 2009, mainly due to
    CityCenter’s September 2009 decision to discount the prices
    of its residential inventory by 30%. This decision and related
    market conditions led to CityCenter management’s conclusion
    that the carrying value of the REUD was not recoverable based on
    estimates of undiscounted cash flows. As a result, CityCenter
    was required to compare the fair value of its REUD to its
    carrying value and record an impairment charge for the
    shortfall. Fair value of the REUD was determined using a
    discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s
    expectations of future cash flows. The key inputs in the
    discounted cash flow analysis included estimated sales prices of
    units currently under contract and new unit sales, the
    absorption rate over the estimated sell-out period, and the
    discount rate. This analysis resulted in an impairment charge of
    approximately $348 million of the REUD. We recognized our
    50% share of such impairment charge, adjusted by certain basis
    differences, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $203 million.

Due to the completion of construction of the Mandarin Oriental
    residential inventory in the first quarter of 2010 and
    completion of the Veer residential inventory in the second
    quarter of 2010, CityCenter is required to carry its residential
    inventory at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less
    costs to sell. CityCenter determines fair value of its
    residential inventory using a discounted cash flow analysis
    based on management’s current expectations of future cash
    flows. The key inputs in the discounted cash flow analysis
    include estimated sales prices of units currently under contract
    and new unit sales, the absorption rate over the sell-out
    period, and the discount rate. These estimates are subject to
    management’s judgment and are highly sensitive to changes
    in the market and economic conditions, including the estimated
    absorption period. In the event current sales forecasts are not
    met, additional impairment charges may be recognized in future
    periods.

As a result of its impairment analyses of its residential
    inventory, CityCenter recorded impairment charges for the
    Mandarin Oriental residential inventory of $171 million and
    $20 million in the first and third quarter of 2010 and
    impairment charges for the Veer residential inventory of
    $57 million, $55 million and $27 million, in the
    second, third and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively.
    Impairment charges in the third quarter primarily related to an
    increase in final cost estimates for the residential inventory.
    We recognized our 50% share of such impairment charges,
    resulting in pre-tax charges of $166 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2010, respectively, included in
    “Income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates.”

CityCenter Harmon Impairment.

The Harmon
    Hotel & Spa (“Harmon”) was originally
    planned to include over 200 residential units and a 400-room
    non-gaming lifestyle hotel. In 2009, we announced that the
    opening of the Harmon hotel component would be delayed until we
    and our joint venture partner, Infinity World, mutually agreed
    to its completion, and that the residential component had been
    canceled.

During the third quarter of 2010, CityCenter management
    determined that it is unlikely that the Harmon will be completed
    using the building as it now stands. As a result, CityCenter
    recorded an impairment charge of $279 million in the third
    quarter of 2010 related to construction in progress assets. The
    impairment of Harmon did not affect our loss from unconsolidated
    affiliates, because we had previously recognized our 50% share
    of the impairment charge in connection with prior impairments of
    our investment balance.

M Resort Note.

At June 30, 2009, we reviewed
    our M Resort Note for impairment. Based on our review of the
    operating results of M Resort, as well as the M Resort’s
    management’s revised cash flow projections post-opening,
    which were significantly lower than original predictions due to
    market and general economic conditions, we determined that the
    fair value of the M Resort Note was $0, that the decline in
    value was

“other-than-temporary,”

and that the entire amount of the indicated impairment related
    to a credit loss. Based on these conclusions, we



recorded a pre-tax impairment of $176 million in the second
    quarter of 2009 within “Other, net.” Of that amount,
    $82 million was reclassified from accumulated other
    comprehensive loss, which amount was $54 million net of
    tax. We stopped recording accrued

“paid-in-kind”

interest as of May 31, 2009, and no longer hold this note.

Atlantic City Renaissance Pointe Land.

We reviewed
    the carrying value of our Renaissance Pointe land holdings for
    impairment at December 31, 2009 as we did not intend to
    pursue development of our MGM Grand Atlantic City project for
    the foreseeable future. Our Board of Directors subsequently
    terminated this project. Our Renaissance Pointe land holdings
    included a

72-acre

development site and included 11 acres of land subject to a
    long-term lease with the Borgata joint venture. The fair value
    of the development land was determined based on a market
    approach, and the fair value of land subject to the long-term
    lease with Borgata was determined using a discounted cash flow
    analysis using expected contractual cash flows under the lease
    discounted at a market capitalization rate. As a result of our
    review, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of
    $548 million in the 2009 fourth quarter, which was included
    in “Property transactions, net” related to our land
    holdings on Renaissance Pointe and capitalized development costs.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment.

We
    perform our annual impairment test related to goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets during the fourth quarter of
    each year. As a result of our 2008 analysis, we recognized a
    non-cash impairment charge of $1.2 billion. The impairment
    charge related solely to the goodwill and other indefinite-lived
    intangible assets recognized in the 2005 acquisition of Mandalay
    Resort Group, and represented substantially all of the goodwill
    recognized at the time of the Mandalay acquisition and a minor
    portion of the value of trade names related to the Mandalay
    resorts. The impairment charge resulted from factors affected by
    economic conditions at the time, including: 1) lower market
    valuation multiples for gaming assets; 2) higher discount
    rates resulting from turmoil in the credit and equity markets;
    and 3) cash flow forecasts for the Mandalay resorts. No
    impairment charges were required as a result of our 2010 and
    2009 analyses.

Monte
    Carlo Fire

We maintain insurance for both property damage and business
    interruption relating to catastrophic events, such as the
    rooftop fire at Monte Carlo in January 2008. Business
    interruption coverage covers lost profits and other costs
    incurred during the closure period and up to six months
    following re-opening.

We reached final settlement agreements for the Monte Carlo Fire
    in early 2009. In total, we received $74 million of
    proceeds from our insurance carriers. We recognized the
    $41 million of excess insurance recoveries in income in
    2009 and 2008, with recoveries offsetting a write-down of
    $4 million related to the net book value of damaged assets,
    demolition costs of $7 million, and operating costs of
    $21 million. In 2009, $15 million and $7 million
    of such excess insurance recoveries were recognized as offsets
    to “General and administrative” expense and
    “Property transactions, net,” respectively. In 2008,
    $9 million and $10 million of such excess insurance
    recoveries were recognized as offsets to “General and
    administrative” expense and “Property transactions,
    net,” respectively.

Key
    Performance Indicators

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino
    resorts, which includes offering gaming, hotel, dining,
    entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. Over half of
    our net revenue is derived from non-gaming activities as our
    operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience
    for our guests, including non-gaming amenities for which our
    guests are willing to pay a premium. Our significant convention
    and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and
    customer volumes during off-peak times such as mid-week or
    during traditionally slower leisure travel periods, which also
    leads to better labor utilization. We believe that we own
    several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have
    continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our
    competitive advantage.

As a resort-based company, our operating results are highly
    dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in
    turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and
    other amenities. We also generate a significant portion of our
    operating income from the high-end gaming segment, which can be
    a cause for variability in our results. Key performance
    indicators related to revenue are:

•

Gaming revenue indicators – table games drop and slots
    handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold”
    percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal
    table games hold percentage is in the range of



19% to 23% of table games drop and our normal slots hold
    percentage is in the range of 7.5% to 8.5% of slots handle;

•

Hotel revenue indicators – hotel occupancy (a volume
    indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price
    indicator); revenue per available room (“REVPAR,” a
    summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy
    rate).

Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers
    wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash
    or credit cards. Our resorts, like many in the industry,
    generate significant operating cash flow. Our industry is
    capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our
    resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing,
    fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash
    for future development.

We generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income
    from our resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada, which exposes us to
    certain risks, such as increased competition from new or
    expanded Las Vegas resorts, and from the expansion of gaming in
    California. We are also exposed to risks related to tourism and
    the general economy, including national and global economic
    conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature,
    though a variety of factors may affect the results of any
    interim period, including the timing of major Las Vegas
    conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special
    events for our high-end customers, and the level of play during
    major holidays, including New Year and Chinese New Year. We
    market to different customer segments to manage our hotel
    occupancy, such as targeting large conventions to increase
    mid-week occupancy. Our results do not depend on key individual
    customers, although our success in marketing to customer groups,
    such as convention customers, or the financial health of
    customer segments, such as business travelers or high-end gaming
    customers from a particular country or region, can affect our
    results.

Net revenues including reimbursed costs increased 1% from 2009.
    Excluding reimbursed costs, net revenues decreased 3% in 2010
    and 18% in 2009 largely due to the economic factors discussed in
    “Effect of Economic Factors on Results of Operations.”
    As discussed further in “Operating Results
    – Detailed Revenue Information,”



revenues have decreased across most lines of business. In
    response to this decrease in revenues, we have implemented cost
    savings efforts to reduce departmental operating expenses, but
    due to our leveraged business model a significant portion of the
    decline in revenue affected operating results.

Corporate expense decreased 14% in 2010 primarily as a result of
    higher legal and advisory costs associated with our activities
    to improve our financial position in 2009. Corporate expense in
    2009 increased 32% compared to 2008 due to the legal and
    advisory costs as well as the accrual of bonus expense in 2009;
    there was no bonus accrual in 2008 due to not meeting internal
    profit targets.

Depreciation and amortization expense in 2010 decreased 8% due
    to certain assets being fully depreciated. Depreciation and
    amortization expense decreased in 2009 due to certain assets
    becoming fully depreciated and the sale of TI. In addition,
    other transactions, events, and impairment charges had a
    significant impact on our earnings performance, the most
    significant of which are discussed in the “Executive
    Overview” section above.

Table games revenue in 2010 decreased 13% in 2010 on a same
    store basis, mainly as a result of lower overall table games
    volumes which decreased 6%, and lower hold percentage. Table
    games revenue in 2009 decreased 11%, or 9% on a same store
    basis, due to a decrease in overall table games volume, despite
    an increase of 33% for baccarat volume. Table games hold
    percentage was below the mid-point of our normal range in 2010
    and near the mid-point for 2009 and 2008.

Slots revenue decreased 2% in 2010, or 1% on a same store basis,
    as a result of a decrease in volume at our Las Vegas Strip
    resorts. Decreases at our Las Vegas Strip resorts were partially
    offset by a 5% increase in revenue at MGM Grand Detroit and a 3%
    increase in revenue at Gold Strike Tunica. Slots revenue
    decreased 12% in 2009, or 9% on a same store basis, driven by a
    decrease in volume at our Las Vegas Strip resorts. In 2009, most
    of our Las Vegas Strip resorts experienced decreases in the
    high single digits, while MGM Grand Detroit and Gold Strike
    Tunica experienced decreases in the low single digits.



Rooms revenue decreased 4% on a same store basis in 2010 and 24%
    on a same store basis in 2009 as a result of a decrease in
    occupancy and lower average room rates. The following table
    shows key hotel statistics for our Las Vegas Strip resorts:

Food and beverage, entertainment, and retail revenues in 2010
    and 2009 were negatively affected by lower customer spending and
    decreased occupancy at our resorts. In 2009, entertainment
    revenues benefited from the addition of

Terry Fator

at
    The Mirage and

The Lion King

at Mandalay Bay.

Reimbursed costs revenue represents reimbursement of costs,
    primarily payroll-related, incurred by us in connection with the
    provision of management services. We recognize costs reimbursed
    pursuant to management services as revenue in the period we
    incur the costs. Reimbursed costs, which are related mainly to
    our management of CityCenter, were $359 million,
    $99 million and $47 million for 2010, 2009, and 2008,

See discussion of our impairment charges under “Executive
    Overview.” Other property transactions during 2010 related
    primarily to write-downs of various discontinued capital
    projects. Other property transactions in 2009 primarily related
    to write-downs of various discontinued capital projects and
    offset by $7 million in insurance recoveries related to the
    Monte Carlo fire. Other property transactions in 2008 included
    $30 million related to the write-down of land and building
    assets of Primm Valley Golf Club. The 2008 period also included
    approximately $9 million of demolition costs associated
    with various room remodel projects as well as the write-down of
    approximately $27 million of various discontinued capital
    projects. These amounts were offset by a gain on the sale of an
    aircraft of $25 million and $10 million of insurance
    recoveries related to the Monte Carlo fire.

Operating results for CityCenter included $166 million and

    and 2009, respectively. As a result of the transfer of Borgata
    assets into trust in 2010, we no longer record Borgata income in
    income from unconsolidated affiliates. The 2009 results also
    included a $12 million charge related to development costs
    for our postponed joint venture project on the North Las Vegas
    Strip and $14 million related to insurance proceeds
    recognized at Borgata.

In 2010, gross interest costs increased due to higher interest
    rates on our senior credit facility and newly issued fixed rate
    borrowings. Included in interest expense in 2010 is
    $31 million of amortization of debt discount associated
    with the amendment of our senior credit facility during 2010. In
    2009, gross interest costs increased compared to 2008 mainly due
    to higher average debt balances during 2009, higher interest
    rates for borrowings under our senior credit facility in 2009,
    higher interest rates for newly issued fixed rate borrowings, as
    well as breakage fees for voluntary repayments of our revolving
    credit facility.

We did not have any capitalized interest in 2010, as we ceased
    capitalization of interest related to CityCenter in December
    2009 and we have no other qualifying capital projects ongoing.
    Capitalized interest increased in 2009 compared to 2008 due to
    higher CityCenter investment balances and higher weighted
    average cost of debt. The amounts presented above exclude
    non-cash gross interest and corresponding capitalized interest
    for 2008 and 2009 related to our CityCenter delayed equity
    contribution.

The income tax benefit on pre-tax loss in 2010 was provided
    essentially at the federal statutory rate of 35%. The income tax
    benefit provided on pre-tax loss in 2009 was greater than 35%
    primarily as a result of state tax benefit provided on the
    write-down of land in Atlantic City. The write-down of goodwill
    in 2008, which was treated as a permanently non-deductible item
    in our federal income tax provision, caused us to incur a
    provision for income tax expense in 2008 even though our pre-tax
    result was a loss for that year. Excluding the effect of the
    goodwill write-down, the effective tax rate from continuing
    operations for 2008 was 37.3%.

The net refund of cash taxes in 2010 was due primarily to the
    carryback to prior years of U.S. federal income tax net
    operating losses incurred in 2009. The net refund of cash taxes
    in 2009 was due primarily to refunds of taxes that were paid in
    2008. Cash taxes were paid in 2008 despite the pre-tax operating
    loss due to the non-deductible goodwill write-down and cash
    taxes paid on the gain from the CityCenter joint venture
    transaction that occurred in 2007. Since the CityCenter gain was
    realized in the fourth quarter of 2007, the associated income
    taxes were paid in 2008.

Non-GAAP Measures

“Adjusted EBITDA” is earnings before interest and
    other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and
    amortization, preopening and

start-up

expenses, and property transactions, net. “Adjusted
    Property EBITDA” is Adjusted EBITDA before corporate
    expense and stock compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA and
    Adjusted



Property EBITDA information is presented solely as a
    supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we
    believe that these measures are: 1) widely used measures of
    operating performance in the gaming industry, and 2) a
    principal basis for valuation of gaming companies.

We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and
    Adjusted Property EBITDA may be recurring in nature and should
    not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it
    is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results
    and trends compared to other periods because these items can
    vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions
    or events that may not be comparable between the periods being
    presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate
    specifically to current operating trends or be indicative of
    future results. For example, preopening and

start-up

expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are
    developing and constructing a major expansion project and
    dependent on where the current period lies within the
    development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the
    project(s). “Property transactions, net” includes
    normal recurring disposals and gains and losses on sales of
    assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also
    includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort
    or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset
    groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may
    not be comparable period over period. In addition, capital
    allocation, tax planning, financing and stock compensation
    awards are all managed at the corporate level. Therefore, we use
    Adjusted Property EBITDA as the primary measure of our operating
    resorts’ performance.

Adjusted EBITDA or Adjusted Property EBITDA should not be
    construed as an alternative to operating income or net income,
    as an indicator of our performance; or as an alternative to cash
    flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or
    as any other measure determined in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles. We have significant uses of cash
    flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes
    and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in
    Adjusted EBITDA. Also, other companies in the gaming and
    hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDA information
    may calculate Adjusted EBITDA in a different manner.

On a same store basis, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 15% in 2010.
    Excluding the $166 million impact from the residential real
    estate impairment charges at CityCenter and $58 million of
    forfeited residential deposits at CityCenter in 2010, and a
    $203 million impairment charge related to CityCenter real
    estate under development, $15 million of Monte Carlo
    insurance recoveries and $12 million of impairment related
    to our proposed North Las Vegas Strip joint venture
    project in 2009, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 20%. Adjusted EBITDA
    on a same store basis decreased 38% in 2009, mainly as a result
    of the factors previously discussed in “Operating
    Results – Detailed Revenue Information.”
    Excluding the real estate under development impairment, North
    Las Vegas Strip impairment and Monte Carlo insurance
    recoveries, Adjusted EBITDA decreased 27% in 2009.



On a same store basis, Adjusted Property EBITDA from
    wholly-owned operations decreased to $1.2 billion in 2010
    from $1.3 billion in 2009 as a result of previously
    discussed operating trends. Adjusted Property EBITDA from
    wholly-owned operations decreased 26% in 2009 compared to 2008.

Cash
    Flows – Operating Activities

Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our
    operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be
    affected by the timing of significant tax payments or refunds
    and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash flow from
    operating activities decreased 14% in 2010 due to a decrease in
    operating income excluding non-cash charges, partially offset by
    net tax refunds of $330 million during 2010. Cash flow from
    operating activities decreased 22% in 2009 primarily due to a
    decrease in operating income and the sale of TI. Operating cash
    flows also decreased due to a $47 million increase in our
    receivable from CityCenter, partially offset by increased
    distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. The 2008 period
    also included a significant tax payment, approximately
    $300 million, relating to the 2007 CityCenter joint venture
    transaction.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we held cash and cash
    equivalents of $499 million and $2.1 billion,
    respectively. On December 30, 2009, we borrowed the
    remaining availability of $1.6 billion under our senior
    credit facility and repaid such borrowings immediately after
    year end.



We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our
    resorts. Beyond our cash on hand, we utilize company-wide cash
    management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held in
    banks. Funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily into
    central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight
    or are used to repay borrowings under our bank credit facilities.

Cash
    Flows – Investing Activities

A significant portion of our investing activities over the past
    three years related to our CityCenter joint venture. In 2010, we
    made contributions of $553 million to CityCenter related to
    the completion guarantee, of which $124 million is payable
    to us from CityCenter from future condominium sales proceeds. In
    2009, we made equity contributions of $731 million to
    CityCenter. In 2008, we made loans and equity contributions
    totaling $1.15 billion.

In 2010, we recognized $135 million of distributions from
    unconsolidated affiliates within investing activities as a
    return of our investments, which primarily related to MGM Macau.
    We received a total of $192 million from MGM Macau in 2010,
    $59 million of which was recognized as cash flows from
    operating activities. In addition, our New Jersey trust account
    received $113 million of net distributions from Borgata and
    received $71 million from the sale of ground leases and
    underlying land. All amounts in the trust account, including the
    proceeds from the sale of our Borgata interest, will be
    distributed to us upon consummation of the sale of our Borgata
    interest. $150 million of the assets held in trust has been
    invested in treasury securities with maturities greater than
    90 days.

We received $746 million in net proceeds related to the
    sale of TI in 2009. The insurance recoveries classified as
    investing cash flows relate to the Monte Carlo fire in 2009 and
    2008.

Capital expenditures of $207 million in 2010 mainly relate
    to maintenance capital expenditures at various resorts and the
    purchase of an airplane.

Capital expenditures of $137 million in 2009 consisted
    primarily of room remodel projects and various property
    enhancements, including capitalized interest.

In 2008, capital expenditures of $782 million related to
    the following, including related capitalized interest:

•

$64 million for CityCenter people mover and related assets;

•

$19 million related to construction costs for MGM Grand
    Detroit;

•

$61 million of development costs related to MGM Grand
    Atlantic City;

•

$230 million related to room remodel projects; and

•

$408 million for various other property enhancements and
    amenities.

Cash
    Flows – Financing Activities

In 2010, excluding the $1.6 billion we repaid in early
    January on our senior credit facility, we repaid net debt of
    $290 million. We issued the following senior secured,
    convertible senior and senior notes during 2010:

•

$1.15 billion of 4.25% convertible senior notes due 2015
    and paid $81 million for capped call transactions entered
    into in connection with the issuance;

•

$845 million of 9% senior secured notes due
    2020; and

•

$500 million of 10% senior notes due 2016.

In the fourth quarter of 2010, we issued approximately
    47 million shares of our common stock for total net
    proceeds to us of approximately $588 million. Concurrently
    with our stock issuance, Tracinda sold approximately
    32 million shares of our common stock. We did not receive
    any proceeds from the sale of such common stock by Tracinda.

We repaid the following principal amounts of senior and senior
    subordinated notes during 2010:

•

$75 million 8.375% senior subordinated notes (redeemed
    prior to maturity essentially at par);

•

$297 million 9.375% senior notes (repaid at
    maturity); and

•

$782 million of our 8.5% senior notes (redeemed
    $136 million prior to maturity essentially at par and
    repaid $646 million at maturity).



Excluding the $1.6 billion borrowed under the senior credit
    facility in late December 2009 and repaid in early January 2010,
    we repaid net debt of $1.1 billion in 2009. In addition,
    pursuant to our development agreement, we repaid
    $50 million of bonds issued by the Economic Development
    Corporation of the City of Detroit. In May 2009, we issued
    approximately 164.5 million shares of our common stock at
    $7 per share, for total net proceeds to us of $1.2 billion.

We issued the following senior secured and senior notes during
    2009:

•

$650 million of 10.375% senior secured notes due 2014;

•

$850 million of 11.125% senior secured notes due
    2017; and

•

$475 million of 11.375% senior notes due 2018.

We repaid the following principal amounts of senior and senior
    subordinated notes during 2009:

•

$226.3 million 6.5% senior notes (redeemed
    $122.3 million prior to maturity essentially at par);

•

$820 million 6% senior notes (redeemed
    $762.6 million prior to maturity essentially at par and the
    remaining $57.4 million was repaid at maturity); and

•

$100 million 7.25% senior debentures (redeemed prior
    to maturity for $127 million).

In 2008, we borrowed net debt of $2.4 billion including
    $2.5 billion under our senior credit facility. Also in
    2008, we issued $750 million of 13% senior secured
    notes due 2013.

We repaid the following senior and senior subordinated notes at
    maturity during 2008:

•

$180.4 million of 6.75% senior notes; and

•

$196.2 million of 9.5% senior notes.

Also in 2008, we repurchased $345 million of principal
    amounts of various series of our outstanding senior notes at a
    purchase price of $263 million in open market repurchases
    as part of a repurchase program authorized by our Board of
    Directors. We redeemed at par $149.4 million of the
    principal amount of our 7% debentures due 2036 pursuant to
    a one-time put option by the holders of such debentures.

Our share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase
    programs approved by our Board of Directors and publicly
    announced. In May 2008, our Board of Directors approved a
    20 million share repurchase plan that was still fully
    available at December 31, 2010, subject to limitations
    under our agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. We
    did not repurchase any shares of common stock during 2010 and
    2009. In 2008, we repurchased 18.1 million shares at an
    average price of $68.36.

Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity

MGM Macau.

In September 2010, MGM China Holdings
    Limited, a Cayman Islands company formed by us and
    Ms. Pansy Ho, that would own the entity that operates MGM
    Macau, filed a proposed listing application on Form A1 with
    The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (“Hong Kong
    Exchange”) in connection with a possible listing of its
    shares on the main board of the Hong Kong Exchange. There have
    not been any decisions made regarding the timing or terms of any
    such listing, whether MGM China Holdings Limited will ultimately
    proceed with this transaction, or whether the application will
    be approved by the Hong Kong Exchange.

We received approximately $192 million from MGM Macau
    during 2010, which represents a full repayment of our interest
    and non-interest bearing notes to that entity.

Tax refunds.

We expect to receive tax refunds of
    approximately $175 million during 2011.

Borgata settlement.

As discussed in “Executive
    Overview — Borgata,” we entered into a settlement
    agreement with the DGE under which we will sell our 50%
    ownership interest in Borgata and related leased land in
    Atlantic City. Prior to the consummation of the sale, the
    divestiture trust will retain any cash flows received in respect
    of the trust property, but will pay property taxes and other
    costs attributable to the trust property. We have received
    significant distributions from Borgata in the past few years,
    and not having access to such distributions until the ultimate
    sale could negatively affect our liquidity in interim periods.



CityCenter July 2010 capital call.

We and Infinity
    World each made capital contributions to CityCenter of
    $32.5 million in July 2010. Our contribution was made
    through a reduction in our receivable from CityCenter. A portion
    of Infinity World’s cash contribution was used to repay an
    additional portion of the amounts owed to us for costs paid by
    us on behalf of the joint venture. If CityCenter is unable to
    generate sufficient cash flows to fund its future obligations,
    the joint venture may request additional capital contributions
    from its partners.

CityCenter January 2011 debt restructuring
    transactions.

In January 2011, CityCenter completed a
    series of transactions including issuance of $900 million
    in aggregate principal amount of 7.625% senior secured
    first lien notes due 2016 and $600 million in aggregate
    principal amount of 10.75%/11.50% senior secured second
    lien PIK toggle notes due 2017 in a private placement. The
    interest rate on the second lien notes is 11.50% if CityCenter
    pays interest in the form of additional debt. CityCenter
    received net proceeds from the offering of the notes of
    $1.46 billion after initial purchaser’s discounts and
    commissions but before other offering expenses.

Effective concurrently with the notes offering,
    CityCenter’s senior credit facility was amended and
    restated which extended the maturity of $500 million of the
    $1.85 billion outstanding loans until January 21,
    2015. The restated senior credit facility does not include a
    revolving loan component. All borrowings under the senior credit
    facility in excess of $500 million were repaid using the
    proceeds of the first lien notes and the second lien notes. In
    addition, net proceeds from the note offerings, together with
    equity contributions of $73 million from the members were
    used to fund the interest escrow account of $159 million
    for the benefit of the holders of the first lien notes and the
    lenders under the restated senior credit facility. The restated
    senior credit facility is secured, on a pari passu basis with
    the first lien notes, by a first priority lien on substantially
    all of CityCenter’s assets and those of its subsidiaries,
    except that any proceeds generated by the sale of Crystals
    outside of bankruptcy or foreclosure proceedings will be paid
    first to the lenders under the restated senior credit facility.

The restated senior credit facility also contains certain
    covenants, including financial covenants, which require
    CityCenter to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio (EBITDA
    to interest charges as defined in the agreement) of
    (i) 1.10 to 1.0 for the quarter ending September 30,
    2012; (ii) 1.15 to 1.0 for the quarter ending
    December 31, 2012; (iii) 1.25 to 1.0 for the quarters
    ending March 31, 2013 and June 30, 2013; and
    (iv) 1.50 to 1.0 for all quarters thereafter. In addition,
    the restated senior credit facility limits CityCenter’s
    capital expenditures to no more than $50 million per year
    (with unused amounts in any fiscal year rolling over to the next
    fiscal year, but not any fiscal year thereafter).

Principal
    Debt Arrangements

Our long-term debt consists of publicly held senior, senior
    secured, senior subordinated and convertible senior notes and
    our senior credit facility. We pay fixed rates of interest
    ranging from 4.25% to 13% on our senior, senior secured,
    convertible senior and subordinated notes. At December 31,
    2010, our senior credit facility had a capacity of
    $3.5 billion consisting of a term loan facility of
    $1.8 billion and a revolving credit facility of
    $1.7 billion and interest was based on a LIBOR margin of
    5.00%, with a LIBOR floor of 2.00%, and a base margin of 4.00%,
    with a base rate floor of 4.00%. See “Executive
    Overview” for more information related to the amendment and
    extension of our senior credit facility.

Our senior credit facility contains certain financial and
    non-financial covenants, including a quarterly minimum EBITDA
    test, based on a rolling

12-month

EBITDA and a covenant limiting annual capital expenditures.
    Further, our senior credit facility and certain of our debt
    securities contain restrictive covenants that, among other
    things, limit our ability to pay dividends or distributions,
    repurchase or issue equity, prepay debt or make certain
    investments; incur additional debt or issue certain disqualified
    stock and preferred stock; incur liens on assets; pledge or sell
    assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or
    substantially all assets; enter into transactions with
    affiliates; allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets; and
    enter into sale and lease-back transactions. We are in
    compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants
    under our senior credit facilities as of December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2010, we were required under our senior
    credit facility to maintain a minimum trailing annual EBITDA (as
    defined) of $1.0 billion, which increases to
    $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2011, $1.15 billion
    as of September 30, 2011, and $1.2 billion as of
    December 31, 2011, with additional periodic increases
    thereafter. As of December 31, 2010, we had annual EBITDA
    calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreement of



approximately $1.14 billion and were in compliance with the
    minimum EBITDA covenant. Additionally, we are limited to
    $400 million of annual capital expenditures (as defined)
    during 2010 and are limited to $500 million of annual
    capital expenditures in 2011. At December 31, 2010, we were
    in compliance with the maximum capital expenditures covenant.

All of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of
    our material subsidiaries, other than MGM Grand Detroit,
    LLC, our foreign subsidiaries and their U.S. holding
    companies, and our insurance subsidiaries. MGM Grand Detroit is
    a guarantor under the senior credit facility, but only to the
    extent that MGM Grand Detroit, LLC borrows under such facility.
    At December 31, 2010, the outstanding amount of borrowings
    related to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC was $450 million. In
    connection with our May 2009 senior credit facility amendment,
    MGM Grand Detroit granted lenders a security interest in its
    assets to secure its obligations under the senior credit
    facility.

Also in connection with our May 2009 senior credit facility
    amendment, we granted a security interest in Gold Strike Tunica
    and certain undeveloped land on the Las Vegas Strip to secure up
    to $300 million of obligations under the senior credit
    facility. In addition, substantially all of the assets of New
    York-New York serve as collateral for the 13% senior
    secured notes issued in 2008, substantially all of the assets of
    Bellagio and The Mirage serve as collateral for the 10.375% and
    11.125% senior secured notes issued in 2009, and
    substantially all of the assets of the MGM Grand serve as
    collateral for the 9.00% senior secured notes issued in
    2010. Upon the issuance of the 10.375%, 11.125%, and
    9.00% senior secured notes, the holders of our
    13% senior secured notes due 2013 obtained an equal and
    ratable lien in all collateral securing these notes. No other
    assets serve as collateral for our principal debt arrangements.

Off
    Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments in unconsolidated affiliates.

Our off
    balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in
    unconsolidated affiliates, which consist primarily of our
    investments in CityCenter, Grand Victoria, Silver Legacy, and
    MGM Macau. We have not entered into any transactions with
    special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative
    transactions. Our unconsolidated affiliate investments allow us
    to realize the proportionate benefits of owning a full-scale
    resort in a manner that minimizes our initial investment. We
    have not historically guaranteed financing obtained by our
    investees, and there are no other provisions of the venture
    agreements which we believe are unusual or subject us to risks
    to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of
    the resort.

CityCenter completion guarantee.

We entered into an
    unlimited completion and cost overrun guarantee with respect to
    CityCenter, secured by our interests in the assets of Circus
    Circus Las Vegas and certain adjacent undeveloped land. The
    terms of the completion guarantee provide that up to
    $250 million of net residential proceeds from the sale of
    condominium properties at CityCenter would be permitted by
    CityCenter’s lenders and our joint venture partner to fund
    construction costs that we will otherwise be obligated to pay
    under the completion guarantee, or to reimburse us for
    construction costs previously expended; however, the timing of
    receipt of such proceeds is uncertain.

As of December 31, 2010, we had funded $553 million
    under the completion guarantee. We have recorded a receivable
    from CityCenter of $124 million related to these amounts,
    which represents amounts reimbursable to us from CityCenter from
    future residential proceeds. At December 31, 2010 our
    remaining estimated net obligation under the completion
    guarantee was approximately $80 million which includes
    estimated litigation costs related to the resolution of disputes
    with contractors as to the final construction costs and reflects
    certain estimated offsets to the amounts claimed by the
    contractors. CityCenter has reached, or expects to reach,
    settlement agreements with most of these construction
    subcontractors; however, significant disputes remain with the
    general contractor and certain subcontractors. Amounts claimed
    by such parties exceed amounts included in our completion
    guarantee accrual by approximately $200 million. Moreover,
    we have not accrued for any contingent payments to CityCenter
    related to the Harmon Hotel & Spa component, which is
    unlikely to be completed using the building as it now stands. We
    do not believe we would be responsible for funding any
    additional remediation efforts that might be required with
    respect to the Harmon; however, our view is based on a number of
    developing factors, including with respect to ongoing litigation
    with CityCenter’s contractors, actions by local officials
    and other developments related to the CityCenter venture, that
    are subject to change. See “Legal Proceedings” for the
    discussion of Perini litigation.



In January 2011, we entered into an amended completion and cost
    overrun guarantee in connection with CityCenter’s restated
    senior credit facility agreement and issuance of
    $1.5 billion of senior secured first lien notes and senior
    secured second lien notes. Consistent with the previous
    completion guarantee, the terms of the amended completion
    guarantee provide for the application of an additional
    $124 million of net residential proceeds from sales of
    condominium properties at CityCenter to fund construction costs,
    or to reimburse us for construction costs previously expended;
    however, the timing of receipt of such proceeds is uncertain.

Letters of credit.

At December 31, 2010, we had
    outstanding letters of credit totaling $37 million.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of
    operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our
    consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
    the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate
    these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we
    consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in
    the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on
    our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
    Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about
    our critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed the
    processes to determine those estimates.



Allowance
    for Doubtful Casino Accounts Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games
    volume at Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and The
    Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the
    same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those
    casinos as well. We maintain strict controls over the issuance
    of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those
    customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These
    collection efforts are similar to those used by most large
    corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts,
    including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices,
    personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and
    civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable
    instruments in the United States. At December 31, 2010 and
    2009, approximately 36% and 40%, respectively, of our casino
    accounts receivable was owed by customers from the United
    States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some
    foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign
    customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the
    United States. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, approximately
    51% and 46%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable was
    owed by customers from the Far East.

We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino
    accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision
    for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the
    allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the
    allowance for doubtful casino accounts. At resorts where marker
    play is not significant, the allowance is generally established
    by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account
    balances. At resorts where marker play is significant, we apply
    standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a
    specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the
    collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified
    dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the
    customer’s financial condition, collection history and any
    other known information. We also monitor regional and global
    economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels
    are adequate.

The collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of
    factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and
    economic conditions in the customers’ home countries.
    Because individual customer account balances can be significant,
    the allowance and the provision can change significantly between
    periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known
    or as changes in a region’s economy occur.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino
    receivables:

The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino
    accounts receivable has increased in the current year due to a
    larger percentage of receivables over 180 days. At
    December 31, 2010, a 100 basis-point change in the
    allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino
    accounts receivable would change net income by $2 million,
    or less than $0.01 per share.

Fixed
    Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies

Property and equipment are stated at cost. For the majority of
    our property and equipment, cost has been determined based on
    estimated fair values in connection with the April 2005 Mandalay
    acquisition and the May 2000 Mirage Resorts acquisition.
    Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value
    of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to
    expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided
    on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of
    the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors,
    property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction
    subsidiaries. In addition, interest cost associated with major
    development and construction projects is capitalized as part of
    the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on
    amounts expended on the project



using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings,
    since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a
    development project. Capitalization of interest starts when
    construction activities begin and ceases when construction is
    substantially complete or development activity is suspended for
    more than a brief period.

We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for
    capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a
    maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment.
    When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine
    whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise
    impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. Our
    depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we
    make about our assets’ estimated useful lives. We determine
    the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar
    assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of
    the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change
    the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change
    prospectively.

Impairment
    of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible
    Assets

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived
    assets for impairment based on our classification as
    a) held for sale or b) to be held and used. Several
    criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for
    sale, including that management with the appropriate authority
    commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in
    relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For
    assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at
    the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of
    disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers
    received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held
    and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of
    impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash
    flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying
    value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the
    carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted
    cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment
    is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically
    measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is
    still under development, future cash flows include remaining
    construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether
    for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used,
    are recorded as operating expenses.

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in
    measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management
    must determine the usage of the asset. To the extent management
    decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an
    impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the
    lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means
    that some assets must be grouped, and management has some
    discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates
    are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ
    materially from our estimates.

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to
    determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that
    indicate a potential impairment. Potential factors which could
    trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to
    historical or projected operating results, negative industry or
    economic factors, or significant changes to our operating
    environment. We estimate future cash flows using our internal
    budgets. When appropriate, we discount future cash flows using a
    weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard
    capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our
    industry.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair
    market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. We
    review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least
    annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances.
    We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each
    fiscal year. Goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for
    impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our
    budgeted future results discounted using a weighted average cost
    of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing
    model based on guideline companies in our industry, and market
    indicators of terminal year capitalization rates. As of the date
    we completed our 2010 goodwill impairment analysis, the
    estimated fair values of our reporting units with associated
    goodwill were substantially in excess of their carrying values.
    Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license
    rights, which are tested for impairment using a discounted cash
    flow approach, and trademarks, which are tested for impairment
    using the relief-from-royalty method.

There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets
    for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are,
    by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ
    materially from our estimates. In addition, the



determination of capitalization rates and the discount rates
    used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent
    in large part on expectations of future market conditions.

See “Executive Overview” and “Results of
    Operations” for discussion of write-downs and impairments
    of long-lived assets, goodwill and intangible assets. Other than
    mentioned therein, we are not aware of events or circumstances
    through December 31, 2010 that would cause us to review any
    material long-lived assets, goodwill or indefinite-lived
    intangible assets for impairment.

Impairment
    of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

We evaluate our investments in unconsolidated affiliates for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying value of our investment may have experienced
    an

“other-than-temporary”

decline in value. If such conditions exist, we compare the
    estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to
    determine whether an impairment is indicated and determine
    whether the impairment is

“other-than-temporary”

based on our assessment of relevant factors, including
    consideration of our intent and ability to retain our
    investment. We estimate fair value using a discounted cash flow
    analysis based on estimates of future cash flows and market
    indicators of discount rates and terminal year capitalization
    rates. See “Executive Overview” for discussion of
    impairment charges recorded in 2010 and 2009 related to our
    investment in CityCenter.

Income
    Taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves,
    related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain
    temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent
    that realization of such benefit is more likely than not.
    Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. Except for certain
    state deferred tax assets and a foreign tax credit carryforward,
    we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax
    assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of
    existing taxable temporary differences. Given the negative
    impact of the U.S. economy on the results of our operations
    in the past several years and our expectations that we will
    continue to be adversely affected by certain aspects of the
    current economic conditions, we no longer rely on future
    operating income in assessing the realizability of our deferred
    tax assets and now rely only on the future reversal of existing
    taxable temporary differences. Accordingly, we concluded during
    2010 that realization of certain of our state deferred tax
    assets was no longer more likely than not and we provided a
    valuation allowance in the amount of $32 million, net of
    federal effect, with a corresponding reduction in income tax
    benefit. Since the future reversal of existing U.S. federal
    taxable temporary differences currently exceed the future
    reversal of existing U.S. federal deductible temporary
    differences, we continue to conclude that it is more likely than
    not that our U.S. federal deferred tax assets, other than the
    foreign tax credit carryforward, are realizable. Should we
    continue to experience operating losses of the same magnitude we
    have experienced in the past several years, it is reasonably
    possible in the near term that the future reversal of our
    U.S. federal deductible temporary differences could exceed
    the future reversal of our U.S. federal taxable temporary
    differences, in which case we would record a valuation allowance
    for such excess with a corresponding reduction of federal income
    tax benefit on our statement of operations.

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax
    authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes
    subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be
    accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities.

We assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax
    position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than
    not” threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of
    benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
    realized. We review uncertain tax positions at each balance
    sheet date. Liabilities we record as a result of this analysis
    are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax
    accounts, and are classified as current (“Other accrued
    liabilities”) or long-term (“Other long-term
    liabilities”) based on the time until expected payment.
    Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if
    any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal
    jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign
    jurisdictions, although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions
    are not material.

As of December 31, 2010, we were no longer subject to
    examination of our U.S. consolidated federal income



tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2005. The IRS
    completed its examination of our consolidated federal income tax
    returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years during 2010 and we paid
    $12 million in tax and $4 million in associated
    interest with respect to adjustments to which we agreed. In
    addition, we submitted a protest to IRS Appeals of certain
    adjustments to which we do not agree. The opening Appeals
    conference has been scheduled to occur in the first quarter of
    2011. It is reasonably possible that the issues subject to
    Appeal may be settled within the next 12 months. During the
    fourth quarter of 2010, the IRS opened an examination of our
    consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2005 through
    2009 tax years.

The IRS informed us during the fourth quarter of 2010 that they
    would initiate an audit of the 2007 through 2009 tax years of
    CityCenter Holdings LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate treated as
    a partnership for income tax purposes. The IRS also informed us
    that they would initiate an audit of the 2008 through 2009 tax
    years of MGM Grand Detroit LLC, a subsidiary treated as a
    partnership for income tax purposes. Neither of these audits was
    initiated in 2010 but we anticipate that both will be initiated
    in early 2011.

We reached settlement during 2010 with IRS Appeals with respect
    to the audit of the 2004 through 2006 tax years of MGM Grand
    Detroit, LLC. At issue was the tax treatment of payments made
    under an agreement to develop, own and operate a hotel casino in
    the City of Detroit. We will owe $1 million in tax as a
    result of this settlement.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, a tentative settlement was
    reached with IRS Appeals with respect to the audit of the 2003
    and 2004 tax years of a cost method investee of ours that is
    treated as a partnership for income tax purposes. The
    adjustments to which we agreed in such settlement will be
    included in any settlement that we may reach with respect to the
    2003 and 2004 examination of our consolidated federal income tax
    return.

The IRS closed during 2010 its examination of the federal income
    tax return of Mandalay Resort Group for the pre-acquisition year
    ended April 25, 2005 and issued a “No-Change
    Letter.” The statutes of limitations for assessing tax for
    all Mandalay Resort Group pre-acquisition years are now closed.

As of December 31, 2010, other than the exceptions noted
    below, we were no longer subject to examination of our various
    state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2006.
    The state of Illinois during 2010 initiated an audit of our
    Illinois combined returns for the 2006 and 2007 tax years. It is
    reasonably possible that this audit will close and all issues
    will be settled in the next 12 months. The state of New
    Jersey began audit procedures during 2010 of a cost method
    investee of ours for the 2003 through 2006 tax years. The City
    of Detroit previously indicated that it would audit a Mandalay
    Resort Group subsidiary return for the pre-acquisition year
    ended April 25 but no audit was initiated and the statute of
    limitations for assessing tax expired in 2010. No other state or
    local income tax returns of ours are currently under exam.

Stock-based
    Compensation

We account for stock options and stock appreciation rights
    (“SARs”) measuring fair value using the

Black-Scholes

model. For restricted stock units, compensation expense is
    calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the
    date of grant. There are several management assumptions required
    to determine the inputs into the Black-Scholes model. Our
    volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly
    affect the fair value of stock options and SARs. The extent of
    the impact will depend, in part, on the extent of awards in any
    given year. In 2010, we granted 3.8 million SARs with a
    total fair value of $27 million. In 2009, we granted
    6.8 million SARs with a total fair value of
    $37 million. In 2008, we granted 4.9 million SARs with
    a total fair value of $72 million.

For 2010 awards, a 10% change in the volatility assumption (71%
    for 2010; for sensitivity analysis, volatility was assumed to be
    64% and 78%) would have resulted in a $2 million, or 8%,
    change in fair value. A 10% change in the expected term
    assumption (4.8 years for 2010; for sensitivity analysis,
    expected term was assumed to be 4.3 years and
    5.3 years) would have resulted in a $1 million, or 4%,
    change in fair value. These changes in fair value would have
    been recognized over the four to five-year vesting period of
    such awards. It should be noted that a change in the expected
    term would cause other changes, since the risk-free rate and
    volatility assumptions are specific to the term; we did not
    attempt to adjust those assumptions in performing the
    sensitivity analysis above.



Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Certain amendments to Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) Topic 810, “Consolidation,” became
    effective for us beginning January 1, 2010. Such amendments
    include changes to the quantitative approach to determine the
    primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”). An enterprise must determine if its variable
    interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest
    in a VIE by evaluating whether 1) the enterprise has the
    power to direct activities of the VIE that have a significant
    effect on economic performance, and 2) the enterprise has
    an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
    from the entity that could potentially be significant to the
    VIE. The amendments to ASC 810 also require ongoing
    reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE. The adoption of these amendments did not
    have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

Market
    Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in
    market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign
    currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is
    interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term
    debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by
    managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and
    short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities. A change
    in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our
    future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments.
    As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is
    acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash
    flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect
    would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when
    the debt matures.

As of December 31, 2010, long-term variable rate borrowings
    represented approximately 19% of our total borrowings. Assuming
    a 100 basis-point increase in LIBOR over the 2% floor specified
    in our senior credit facility, our annual interest cost would
    change by approximately $23 million based on gross amounts
    outstanding at December 31, 2010. The following table
    provides additional information about our gross long-term debt

MANAGEMENT’S
    ANNUAL REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management’s
    Responsibilities

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined
    in

Sections 13a-

15(f) and

15d-

15(f)
    of the Exchange Act) for MGM Resorts International and
    subsidiaries (the “Company”).

Objective
    of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

In establishing adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, management has developed and maintained a system of
    internal control, policies and procedures designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that information contained in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements and other
    information presented in this annual report is reliable, does
    not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
    state a material fact, and fairly presents in all material
    respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented in this
    annual report. These include controls and procedures designed to
    ensure that this information is accumulated and communicated to
    the Company’s management, including its principal executive
    officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to all
    timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Significant
    elements of the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting include, for example:

•

Hiring skilled accounting personnel and training them
    appropriately;

•

Written accounting policies;

•

Written documentation of accounting systems and procedures;

•

Segregation of incompatible duties;

•

Internal audit function to monitor the effectiveness of the
    system of internal control;

•

Oversight by an independent Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors.

Management’s
    Evaluation

Management, with the participation of the Company’s
    principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has
    evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting using the criteria established in Internal
    Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
    Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on
    its evaluation as of December 31, 2010, management believes
    that the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting is effective in achieving the objectives described
    above.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Deloitte & Touche LLP audited the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 and issued their report thereon, which is
    included in this annual report. Deloitte & Touche LLP
    has also issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and
    such report is also included in this annual report.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM Resorts International

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2010, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s
    management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
    control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the
    effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting,
    included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    the consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2010.
    Our report dated February 28, 2011 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
    schedule.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM Resorts International

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and
    the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits
    also included the financial statement schedule of Valuation and
    Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2). These
    financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MGM
    Resorts International and subsidiaries as of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010, in conformity with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
    opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
    relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as
    a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 28, 2011,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

MGM
    RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 —

ORGANIZATION

MGM Resorts International (the “Company”) is a
    Delaware corporation, formerly named MGM MIRAGE. As of
    December 31, 2010, approximately 27% of the outstanding
    shares of the Company’s common stock were owned by Tracinda
    Corporation, a Nevada corporation wholly-owned by Kirk Kerkorian
    (“Tracinda”). Tracinda has significant influence with
    respect to the election of directors and other matters, but it
    does not have the power to solely determine these matters. MGM
    Resorts International acts largely as a holding company and,
    through wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns

and/or

operates casino resorts.

The Company owns and operates the following casino resorts in
    Las Vegas, Nevada: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, The Mirage,
    Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Monte Carlo, Excalibur,
    and Circus Circus Las Vegas. Operations at MGM Grand Las Vegas
    include management of The Signature at MGM Grand Las Vegas, a
    condominium-hotel consisting of three towers. Other Nevada
    operations include Circus Circus Reno, Gold Strike in Jean, and
    Railroad Pass in Henderson. The Company and its local partners
    own and operate MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan. The
    Company also owns and operates two resorts in Mississippi: Beau
    Rivage in Biloxi and Gold Strike Tunica. The Company also owns
    Shadow Creek, an exclusive world-class golf course located
    approximately ten miles north of its Las Vegas Strip resorts,
    Primm Valley Golf Club at the California/Nevada state line and
    Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi.

The Company owns 50% of CityCenter, located between Bellagio and
    Monte Carlo. The other 50% of CityCenter is owned by Infinity
    World Development Corp (“Infinity World”), a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab
    Emirates government decree entity. CityCenter consists of Aria,
    a 4,004-room casino resort; Mandarin Oriental Las Vegas, a
    392-room non-gaming boutique hotel; Crystals, a retail district
    with 334,000 of currently leaseable square feet; and Vdara, a
    1,495-room luxury condominium-hotel. In addition, CityCenter
    features residential units in the Residences at Mandarin
    Oriental – 225 units and Veer –
    669 units. Aria, Vdara, Mandarin Oriental and Crystals all
    opened in December 2009 and the residential units within
    CityCenter began closing in early 2010. The Company receives a
    management fee of 2% of revenues for the management of Aria and
    Vdara, and 5% of EBITDA (as defined in the agreements governing
    the Company’s management of Aria and Vdara). In addition,
    the Company receives an annual fee of $3 million for the
    management of Crystals.

The Company has 50% interests in MGM Macau, Grand Victoria and
    Silver Legacy. Pansy Ho Chiu-King owns the other 50% of MGM
    Macau. Grand Victoria is a riverboat casino in Elgin, Illinois;
    an affiliate of Hyatt Gaming owns the other 50% of Grand
    Victoria and also operates the resort. Silver Legacy is located
    in Reno, adjacent to Circus Circus Reno, and the other 50% is
    owned by Eldorado LLC.

The Company also has a 50% economic interest in Borgata Hotel
    Casino & Spa (“Borgata”) located on
    Renaissance Pointe in the Marina area of Atlantic City, New
    Jersey; the Company’s interest is held in trust and
    currently offered for sale. Boyd Gaming Corporation
    (“Boyd”) owns the other 50% of Borgata and also
    operates the resort. See Note 5 for further discussion of
    Borgata.

The Company owns additional land adjacent to Borgata, a portion
    of which consists of common roads, landscaping and master plan
    improvements, and a portion of which was planned for a
    wholly-owned development, MGM Grand Atlantic City. As part of
    the settlement discussed in Note 5, the Company has agreed
    that an affiliate of the Company would withdraw its license
    application for this development.

MGM Hospitality seeks to leverage the Company’s management
    expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic
    partnerships and international expansion opportunities. The
    Company has entered into management agreements for hotels in the
    Middle East, North Africa, India and China.

NOTE 2 —

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Principles of consolidation.

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
    subsidiaries. The Company’s investments in unconsolidated
    affiliates which are 50% or less owned are accounted for under
    the equity method. The Company does not have a variable interest
    in any variable interest entities. All



intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
    consolidation. The Company’s operations are primarily in
    one segment: the operation of casino resorts. Other operations
    and foreign operations are not material.

Management’s use of estimates.

The consolidated
    financial statements have been prepared in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. These principles require the Company’s management
    to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
    amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
    assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
    and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
    reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
    estimates.

Reclassifications.

The consolidated financial
    statements for prior years reflect certain reclassifications,
    which have no effect on previously reported net income, to
    conform to the current year presentation. The prior year
    reclassifications relate to the classification of reimbursed
    costs as separate financial statement line items, while in past
    periods these costs were recorded to “Other” revenues
    and expenses. The total amounts reclassified to reimbursed costs
    revenue and expense for the years ended 2009 and 2008 were
    $99 million and $47 million, respectively.

Fair value measurements.

Fair value measurements
    affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments
    of its long-lived assets, investments in unconsolidated
    affiliates, cost method investments, goodwill, and other
    intangibles. Fair value measurements also affect the
    Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets
    and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would
    be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in
    an orderly transaction between market participants at the
    measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that
    includes: “Level 1” inputs, such as quoted prices
    in an active market; “Level 2” inputs, which are
    observable inputs for similar assets; or
    “Level 3” inputs, which are unobservable inputs.

The Company uses fair value measurements when assessing
    impairment of its investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The
    Company estimates such fair value using a discounted cash flow
    analysis utilizing “Level 3” inputs, including
    market indicators of discount rates and terminal year
    capitalization rates. See Note 5 for further discussion.

In connection with its accounting for the March 2010 amended and
    restated credit facility as discussed in Note 8, the
    Company estimated fair value of its senior credit facility using
    “Level 1” inputs. The Company also uses
    “Level 1” inputs for its long-term debt fair
    value disclosures.

The Company used fair value measurements in the accounting for
    its investment in The M Resort LLC 6% convertible note and
    embedded call option (the “M Resort Note”). As of
    June 30, 2009, the fair value of the convertible note and
    embedded call option was measured using “Level 3”
    inputs. See below under “Investment in The M Resort LLC
    convertible note” for further discussion of the valuation
    of the M Resort Note.

At December 31, 2009, the fair value of the Company’s
    carrying value of its Renaissance Pointe land holdings was
    measured using “Level 2” and
    “Level 3” inputs. See below under “Property
    and Equipment” for further discussion of the Renaissance
    Pointe impairment.

During 2008, the Company used “Level 2” inputs to
    evaluate the fair value of its Primm Valley Golf Club
    (“PVGC”). See below under “Property and
    Equipment” for further discussion of the PVGC impairment.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents
    include investments and interest bearing instruments with
    maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition.
    Such investments are carried at cost, which approximates market
    value. Book overdraft balances resulting from the Company’s
    cash management program are recorded as accounts payable,
    construction payable, or other accrued liabilities, as
    applicable.

Accounts receivable and credit risk.

Financial
    instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casino
    accounts receivable. The Company issues markers to approved
    casino customers following background checks and investigations
    of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2010, a substantial
    portion of the Company’s receivables was due from customers
    residing in foreign countries. Business or economic conditions
    or other significant events in these countries could affect the
    collectibility of such receivables.

Accounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are
    initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when
    management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of
    accounts previously written off are



recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful
    accounts is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables
    to their net carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The
    allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer
    accounts as well as historical collection experience and current
    economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of
    December 31, 2010, no significant concentrations of credit
    risk existed for which an allowance had not already been
    recorded.

Inventories.

Inventories consist primarily of food
    and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are
    stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
    primarily using the average cost method for food and beverage
    and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is
    determined using the retail inventory method or specific
    identification method.

Property and equipment.

Property and equipment are
    stated at cost. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and
    equipment are included in the determination of income.
    Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Property and
    equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated
    useful lives on a straight-line basis:

Buildings and improvements

20 to 40 years

Land improvements

10 to 20 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 20 years

Equipment

3 to 20 years

The Company evaluates its property and equipment and other
    long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as
    a) held for sale or b) to be held and used. Several
    criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for
    sale, including that management with the appropriate authority
    commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in
    relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For
    assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the
    lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell,
    as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received,
    or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used,
    the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of
    impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future
    cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the
    carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows
    exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the
    undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then
    an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset,
    typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an
    asset is still under development, future cash flows include
    remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses,
    whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used,
    are recorded as operating expenses.

The Company reviewed the carrying value of its Renaissance
    Pointe land holdings for impairment at December 31, 2009 as
    management did not intend to pursue its MGM Grand Atlantic City
    project for the foreseeable future. The Company’s Board of
    Directors subsequently terminated this project. The
    Company’s Renaissance Pointe land holdings include a

72-acre

development site and included 11 acres of land subject to a
    long-term lease with the Borgata joint venture. The fair value
    of the development land was determined based on a market
    approach and the fair value of land subject to the long-term
    lease with Borgata was determined using a discounted cash flow
    analysis using expected contractual cash flows under the lease
    discounted at a market capitalization rate. As a result, the
    Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of
    $548 million in the 2009 fourth quarter, which was included
    in “Property transactions, net,” related to its land
    holdings on Renaissance Pointe and capitalized development costs.

During 2008, the Company concluded that the Primm Valley Golf
    Club (“PVGC”) should be reviewed for impairment due to
    its recent operating losses and the Company’s expectation
    that such operating losses will continue. The estimated future
    undiscounted cash flows of PVGC did not exceed its carrying
    value. The Company determined the estimated fair value of PVGC
    to be approximately $14 million based on the comparable
    sales approach. The carrying value of PVGC exceeds its estimated
    fair value and as a result, the Company recorded an impairment
    charge of $30 million which is included in “Property
    transactions, net” for the year ended December 31,
    2008.

Capitalized interest.

The interest cost associated
    with major development and construction projects is capitalized
    and included in the cost of the project. When no debt is
    incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on
    amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost
    of the Company’s outstanding



borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project
    is substantially complete or development activity is suspended
    for more than a brief period.

Investment in The M Resort LLC convertible note.

At
    June 30, 2009, the Company determined that the fair value
    of the M Resort Note was $0, that the decline in value was

“other-than-temporary,”

and that the entire amount of the indicated impairment related
    to a credit loss. The conclusion that the decline in value was

“other-than-temporary”

was based on the Company’s assessment of actual results
    since the opening of the M Resort and M Resort’s
    management’s revised cash flow projections since its
    opening, which were significantly lower than original
    predictions due to market and general economic conditions. Based
    on the conclusions above, the Company recorded a pre-tax
    impairment charge of $176 million – the accreted
    value as of May 31, 2009 – in the second quarter
    of 2009 within “Other, net” non-operating expense. Of
    that amount, $82 million was reclassified from accumulated
    other comprehensive loss, which amount was $54 million net
    of tax. The Company stopped recording accrued

“paid-in-kind”

interest as of May 31, 2009, and no longer holds this note.

Investments in and advances to unconsolidated
    affiliates.

The Company has investments in
    unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method.
    Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the
    Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses,
    as well as capital contributions to and distributions from these
    companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are
    recognized as a return of investment and recorded as investing
    cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash
    flows.

The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated
    affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its investment
    may have experienced an

“other-than-temporary”

decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares
    the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value
    to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines
    whether the impairment is

“other-than-temporary”

based on its assessment of all relevant factors, including
    consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain
    its investment. The Company estimates fair value using a
    discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results
    of the investee and market indicators of terminal year
    capitalization rates. See Note 5 for results of the
    Company’s review of its investment in certain of its
    unconsolidated affiliates.

Goodwill and other intangible assets.

Goodwill
    represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value
    of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for
    impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in
    certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual
    impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No
    impairments were indicated as a result of the annual impairment
    review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in
    2010 and 2009. See Note 6 for results of the Company’s
    2008 annual impairment tests.

Goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment
    using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated
    future results of the Company’s reporting units discounted
    using the Company’s weighted average cost of capital and
    market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates. The
    implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill is
    compared to the carrying value of that goodwill. The implied
    fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair
    value of the reporting unit to its assets and liabilities and
    the amount remaining, if any, is the implied fair value of
    goodwill. If the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than
    its carrying value then it must be written down to its implied
    fair value. License rights are tested for impairment using a
    discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks are tested for
    impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. If the fair
    value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its
    carrying amount, an impairment loss must be recognized equal to
    the difference.

Revenue recognition and promotional
    allowances.

Casino revenue is the aggregate net
    difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities
    recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play
    occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the
    customers’ possession (“outstanding chip
    liability”). Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and
    other operating revenues are recognized as services are
    performed. Advance deposits on rooms and advance ticket sales
    are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided
    to the customer.



Gaming revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives,
    including discounts and points earned in point-loyalty programs.
    The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other
    services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross
    revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. The
    estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is
    primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Reimbursed expenses.

The Company recognizes costs
    reimbursed pursuant to management services as revenue in the
    period it incurs the costs. Reimbursed costs related mainly to
    the Company’s management of CityCenter and totaled
    $359 million for 2010, $99 million for 2009 and
    $47 million for 2008.

Loyalty programs.

In 2010, the Company’s
    primary point-loyalty program in operation at most of its
    wholly-owned resorts and Aria was Players Club. In Players Club,
    customers earn points based on their slots play, which can be
    redeemed for cash or free play at any of the Company’s
    participating resorts. The Company records a liability based on
    the points earned multiplied by the redemption value less an
    estimate for points not expected to be redeemed and records a
    corresponding reduction in casino revenue. Customers’
    overall level of table games and slots play is also tracked and
    used by management in awarding discretionary
    complimentaries – free rooms, food and beverage and
    other services – for which no accrual is recorded.
    Other loyalty programs at the Company’s resorts typically
    operate in a similar manner, though they generally are available
    only to customers at the individual resorts. At both
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the total company-wide
    liability for point-loyalty programs was $47 million.

The Company implemented a new loyalty program (“M
    life”) at MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, and Gold Strike
    Tunica during the third quarter of 2010 and at its participating
    Las Vegas resorts in January 2011. Customers continue to earn
    points based on their slots play, which can be redeemed for free
    play at any of the Company’s participating resorts. Under
    the new program, customers also earn credits (“express
    comps”) based on their slots play and table games play,
    which can be redeemed for complimentary services, including
    hotel rooms, food and beverage, and entertainment. The Company
    records a liability for the estimated costs of providing
    services for express comps based on the express comps earned
    multiplied by a cost margin less an estimate for express comps
    not expected to be redeemed and records a corresponding expense
    in the casino department.

Advertising.

The Company expenses advertising costs
    the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense,
    which is generally included in general and administrative
    expenses, was $123 million, $118 million, and
    $122 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Corporate expense.

Corporate expense represents
    unallocated payroll and aircraft costs, professional fees and
    various other expenses not directly related to the
    Company’s casino resort operations. In addition, corporate
    expense includes the costs associated with the Company’s
    evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, which are
    expensed as incurred until development of a specific project has
    become probable.

Preopening and

start-up

expenses.

Preopening and

start-up

costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred.
    Costs classified as preopening and

start-up

expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and
    other expenses related to new or

start-up

operations and new customer initiatives.

Property transactions, net.

The Company classifies
    transactions such as write-downs and impairments, demolition
    costs, and normal gains and losses on the sale of assets as
    “Property transactions, net.” See Note 14 for a
    detailed discussion of these amounts.



Income per share of common stock.

    weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares
    used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share
    consisted of the following:

The Company had a loss from continuing operations for the years
    ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Therefore, the
    approximately 28 million, 29 million and
    26 million shares, respectively, underlying outstanding
    stock-based awards were excluded from the computation of diluted
    earnings per share for these periods because to include these
    awards would be anti-dilutive. In addition, the effect of an
    assumed conversion of the Company’s convertible senior
    notes due 2015 would be anti-dilutive.

Currency translation.

The Company translates the
    financial statements of foreign subsidiaries which are not
    denominated in US dollars. Balance sheet accounts are translated
    at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date.
    Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of
    exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments
    resulting from this process are charged or credited to other
    comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income includes
    net income (loss) and all other non-stockholder changes in
    equity, or other comprehensive income. Elements of the
    Company’s other accumulated comprehensive loss are reported
    in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    stockholders’ equity, and the cumulative balance of these
    elements consisted of the following:

Financial statement impact of Monte Carlo
    fire.

The Company maintains insurance for both property
    damage and business interruption relating to catastrophic
    events, such as the rooftop fire at Monte Carlo in January 2008.
    Business interruption insurance covers lost profits and other
    costs incurred during the closure period and up to six months
    following re-opening.

Non-refundable insurance recoveries received in excess of the
    net book value of damaged assets,

clean-up

and
    demolition costs, and post-event costs are recognized as income
    in the period received or committed based on the Company’s
    estimate of the total claim for property damage and business
    interruption compared to the recoveries received at that time.
    Gains on insurance recoveries related to business interruption
    are recorded within “General and administrative”
    expenses and gains related to property damage are recorded
    within “Property transactions, net.” Insurance
    recoveries related to business interruption are classified as
    operating cash flows and recoveries related to property damage
    are classified as investing cash flows in the statement of cash
    flows.

The Company settled its final claim with its insurance carriers
    related to the Monte Carlo fire in 2009 for a total of
    $74 million. The pre-tax impact on the Company’s
    statements of operations for the year ended December 31,
    2009 related to such insurance recoveries included a
    $15 million reduction of “General and
    administrative” expense and a $7 million offset to
    “Property transactions, net.” In 2008, $9 million
    and $10 million of such excess insurance recoveries were
    recognized as offsets to “General and administrative”
    expense and “Property transactions, net,” respectively.



Sale of TI.

On March 20, 2009, the Company
    closed the sale of the Treasure Island casino resort
    (“TI”) to Ruffin Acquisition, LLC for net proceeds to
    the Company of approximately $746 million and recognized a
    pre-tax gain of $187 million related to the sale, which is
    included within “Property transactions, net.” In
    connection with the sale of TI, including the transfer of all of
    the membership interests of TI, TI was released as a guarantor
    of the outstanding indebtedness of the Company and its
    subsidiaries.

As a result of the sale, the Company evaluated TI’s
    operations for potential treatment as discontinued operations.
    The Company concluded significant customer migration would occur
    because there was a shared customer base through the
    Company’s customer loyalty rewards program and because of
    the physical proximity of TI to the Company’s other Las
    Vegas Strip resorts. Most of the loyalty rewards program
    customers of TI were also customers of one or more of the
    Company’s other resorts. The Company retained the ability
    to market to these customers after the sale and believes the
    loyalty rewards program is an important factor in the migration
    of customer play to the Company’s other resorts. The
    Company expects the cash flow benefits of such migration to
    continue for an indefinite period. Therefore, the results of the
    TI operations through the time of sale have not been classified
    as discontinued operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards.

Certain
    amendments to Accounting Standards Codification
    (“ASC”) Topic 810, “Consolidation,” became
    effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2010. Such
    amendments include changes to the quantitative approach to
    determine the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”). An enterprise must determine if its variable
    interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest
    in a VIE by evaluating whether 1) the enterprise has the
    power to direct activities of the VIE that have a significant
    effect on economic performance, and 2) the enterprise has
    an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits
    from the entity that could potentially be significant to the
    VIE. The amendments to ASC 810 also require ongoing
    reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary
    beneficiary of a VIE. The adoption of these amendments did not
    have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated
    financial statements.

CityCenter

Completion guarantee.

In accordance with the
    CityCenter joint venture agreement, as amended, and the
    CityCenter bank credit facility, as amended, the Company has
    provided an unlimited completion and cost overrun
    guarantee – see Note 10 for further discussion.
    The terms of the completion guarantee provide up to
    $250 million of net residential proceeds from the sale of
    condominium properties at CityCenter would be permitted by
    CityCenter’s lenders and the Company’s joint venture
    partner to fund construction costs that the Company would
    otherwise be obligated to pay under the completion guarantee, or
    to reimburse the Company for construction costs previously
    expended; however, the timing of receipt of such proceeds is
    uncertain. As of December 31, 2010, the Company has funded
    $553 million under the completion guarantee. The Company
    has recorded a receivable from CityCenter of $124 million
    related to these amounts, which represents amounts reimbursable
    to the Company from CityCenter from future residential proceeds.
    At December 31, 2010, the Company’s remaining
    estimated net obligation under the completion guarantee was
    $80 million.

Distributions.

The joint venture agreement provides
    that the first $494 million of available distributions must
    be distributed on a priority basis to Infinity World, with the
    next $494 million of distributions made to the Company, and
    distributions shared equally thereafter.

Contributions.

As of December 31, 2009 the
    Company and Infinity World had made all required equity
    contributions. In July 2010, the Company and Infinity World made
    additional capital contributions of $32.5 million each. The
    Company’s contribution was made through a reduction in its
    receivable from CityCenter. A portion of Infinity World’s
    cash contribution was used to repay an additional portion of the
    amounts owed to the Company for costs paid by the Company on
    behalf of the joint venture. In connection with the debt
    restructuring transactions discussed below, the Company and
    Infinity World made equity contributions of approximately
    $37 million each in January 2011.

Investment impairments.

At June 30, 2010 the
    Company reviewed its CityCenter investment for impairment using
    revised operating forecasts developed by CityCenter management.
    Based on current and forecasted market conditions and because
    CityCenter’s results of operations through June 30,
    2010 were below previous forecasts, and the revised operating
    forecasts were lower than previous forecasts, management
    concluded it should review the carrying value of its investment.
    The Company determined that the carrying value of its investment
    exceeded its fair



value determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and
    therefore an impairment was indicated. The Company intends to
    and believes it will be able to retain its investment in
    CityCenter; however, due to the extent of the shortfall and the
    Company’s assessment of the uncertainty of fully recovering
    its investment, the Company determined that the impairment was

“other-than-temporary”

and recorded an impairment charge of $1.12 billion included
    in “Property transactions, net.”

At September 30, 2010, the Company recognized an increase
    of $232 million in its total net obligation under its
    CityCenter completion guarantee, and a corresponding increase in
    its investment in CityCenter. The increase primarily reflects
    revisions to prior estimates based on the Company’s
    assessment of the most current information derived from the
    CityCenter close-out and litigation processes and does not
    reflect certain potential recoveries that are being pursued as
    part of the litigation process. The Company completed an
    impairment review as of September 30, 2010 and as a result
    recorded an additional impairment of $191 million in the
    third quarter of 2010, included in “Property transactions,
    net.”

The discounted cash flow analyses for the Company’s
    investment in CityCenter included estimated future cash inflows
    from operations, including residential sales, and estimated
    future cash outflows for capital expenditures. The June 2010 and
    September 2010 analyses used an 11% discount rate and a
    long-term growth rate of 4% related to forecasted cash flows for
    CityCenter’s operating assets.

At September 30, 2009, the Company reviewed its CityCenter
    investment for impairment using revised operating forecasts
    developed by CityCenter management late in the third quarter. In
    addition, the impairment charge related to CityCenter’s
    residential real estate under development discussed below
    further indicated that the Company’s investment may have
    experienced an

“other-than-temporary”

decline in value. The Company’s discounted cash flow
    analysis for CityCenter included estimated future cash outflows
    for construction and maintenance expenditures and future cash
    inflows from operations, including residential sales. Based on
    its analysis, the Company determined the carrying value of its
    investment exceeded its fair value and determined that the
    impairment was

“other-than-temporary.”

The Company recorded an impairment charge of $956 million
    included in “Property transactions, net.”

Impairments of residential inventory.

Included in
    loss from unconsolidated affiliates for the year ended
    December 31, 2010 is the Company’s share of impairment
    charges relating to completed CityCenter residential inventory.
    Due to the completion of construction of the Mandarin Oriental
    residential inventory in the first quarter of 2010 and
    completion of the Veer residential inventory in the second
    quarter of 2010, CityCenter is required to carry its residential
    inventory at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less
    costs to sell. CityCenter determines fair value of its
    residential inventory using a discounted cash flow analysis
    based on management’s expectations of future cash flows.
    The key inputs in the discounted cash flow analysis include
    estimated sales prices of units currently under contract and new
    unit sales, the absorption rate over the sell-out period, and
    the discount rate. These estimates are subject to
    management’s judgment and are highly sensitive to changes
    in the market and economic conditions, including the estimated
    absorption period. In the event current sales forecasts are not
    met, additional impairment charges may be recognized in future
    periods.

As a result of its impairment analyses of residential inventory,
    CityCenter recorded impairment charges for the Mandarin Oriental
    residential inventory of $171 million and $20 million
    in the first and third quarter of 2010, respectively and
    impairment charges for the Veer residential inventory of
    $57 million, $55 million and $27 million, in the
    second, third and fourth quarters of 2010, respectively.
    Impairment charges in the third quarter primarily related to an
    increase in final cost estimates for the residential inventory.
    The Company recognized its 50% share of such impairment charges,
    resulting in pre-tax charges of $166 million for the year
    ended December 31, 2010, respectively, included in
    “Income (loss) from unconsolidated affiliates.”

Included in loss from unconsolidated affiliates for the year
    ended December 31, 2009 is the Company’s share of an
    impairment charge relating to CityCenter residential real estate
    under development (“REUD”). CityCenter was required to
    review its REUD for impairment as of September 30, 2009,
    mainly due to CityCenter’s September 2009 decision to
    discount the prices of its residential inventory by 30%. This
    decision and related market conditions led to CityCenter
    management’s conclusion that the carrying value of the REUD
    was not recoverable based on estimates of undiscounted cash
    flows. As a result, CityCenter was required to compare the fair
    value of its REUD to its



carrying value and record an impairment charge for the
    shortfall. Fair value of the REUD was determined using a
    discounted cash flow analysis based on management’s current
    expectations of future cash flows. The key inputs in the
    discounted cash flow analysis included estimated sales prices of
    units currently under contract and new unit sales, the
    absorption rate over the sell-out period, and the discount rate.
    This analysis resulted in an impairment charge of approximately
    $348 million of the REUD. The Company recognized its 50%
    share of such impairment charge, adjusted by certain basis
    differences, resulting in a pre-tax charge of $203 million.

Harmon impairment.

The Harmon Hotel & Spa
    (“Harmon”) was originally planned to include over 200
    residential units and a 400-room non-gaming lifestyle hotel. In
    2009, the Company announced that the opening of the Harmon hotel
    component would be delayed until the Company and its joint
    venture partner, Infinity World, mutually agreed to its
    completion, and that the residential component had been canceled.

During the third quarter of 2010, CityCenter management
    determined that it is unlikely that the Harmon will be completed
    using the building as it now stands. As a result, CityCenter
    recorded an impairment charge of $279 million in the third
    quarter of 2010 related to construction in progress assets. The
    impairment of Harmon did not affect the Company’s loss from
    unconsolidated affiliates, because the Company’s 50% share
    of the impairment charge had previously been recognized by the
    Company in connection with prior impairments of its investment
    balance.

January 2011 debt restructuring transactions.

In
    January 2011, CityCenter completed a series of transactions
    including issuance of $900 million in aggregate principal
    amount of 7.625% senior secured first lien notes due 2016
    and $600 million in aggregate principal amount of
    10.75%/11.50% senior secured second lien PIK toggle notes
    due 2017 in a private placement. The interest rate on the second
    lien notes is 11.50% if CityCenter pays interest in the form of
    additional debt. CityCenter received net proceeds from the
    offering of the notes (the “notes offering”) of
    $1.46 billion after initial purchaser’s discounts and
    commissions but before other offering expenses.

Effective concurrently with the notes offering,
    CityCenter’s senior credit facility was amended and
    restated which extended the maturity of $500 million of the
    $1.85 billion outstanding loans until January 21,
    2015. The restated senior credit facility does not include a
    revolving loan component. All borrowings under the senior credit
    facility in excess of $500 million were repaid using the
    proceeds of the first lien notes and the second lien notes. In
    addition, net proceeds from the note offerings, together with
    equity contributions of $73 million from the members were
    used to fund the interest escrow account of $159 million
    for the benefit of the holders of the first lien notes and the
    lenders under the restated senior credit facility. The restated
    senior credit facility is secured, on a pari passu basis with
    the first lien notes, by a first priority lien on substantially
    all of CityCenter’s assets and those of its subsidiaries,
    except that any proceeds generated by the sale of Crystals
    outside of bankruptcy or foreclosure proceedings will be paid
    first to the lenders under the restated senior credit facility.

Borgata

In its June 2005 report to the New Jersey Casino Control
    Commission (the “CCC”), on the application of Borgata
    for renewal of its casino license, the New Jersey Division of
    Gaming Enforcement (the “DGE”) stated that it was
    conducting an investigation of the Company’s relationship
    with its joint venture partner in Macau and that the DGE would
    report to the CCC any material information it deemed appropriate.

On May 18, 2009, the DGE issued a report to the CCC on its
    investigation. In the report, the DGE recommended, among other
    things, that: (i) the Company’s Macau joint venture
    partner be found to be unsuitable; (ii) the Company be
    directed to disengage itself from any business association with
    its Macau joint venture partner; (iii) the Company’s
    due diligence/compliance efforts be found to be deficient; and
    (iv) the CCC hold a hearing to address the report. In March
    2010, the CCC approved the Company’s settlement agreement
    with the DGE pursuant to which the Company placed its 50%
    ownership interest in Borgata and related leased land in
    Atlantic City into a divestiture trust. Following the transfer
    of these interests into trust, the Company ceased to be
    regulated by the CCC or the DGE, except as otherwise provided by
    the trust agreement and the settlement agreement. Boyd Gaming
    Corporation’s (“Boyd”) 50% interest is not
    affected by the settlement.

The terms of the settlement mandate the sale of the trust
    property within a

30-month

period ending in September 2012. During the 18 months
    ending September 2011, the Company has the right to direct the
    trustee to sell the trust property, subject to approval of the
    CCC. If a sale is not concluded by that time, the trustee is
    responsible for selling the trust property during the following

12-month

period. Prior to the consummation of the sale, the divestiture
    trust will retain any cash flows received in respect of the
    trust property, but will pay property taxes and other costs
    attributable to the trust property. The Company is the sole
    economic beneficiary of the trust and will be permitted to
    reapply for a New Jersey gaming license beginning 30 months
    after the completion of the sale of the trust assets. As of
    December 31, 2010, the trust had $188 million of cash
    and investments of which $150 million is held in treasury
    securities with maturities greater than 90 days and is
    recorded within “Prepaid expenses and other.”

As a result of the Company’s ownership interest in Borgata
    being placed into a trust the Company no longer has significant
    influence over Borgata; therefore, the Company discontinued the
    equity method of accounting for Borgata at the point the assets
    were placed in the trust, and accounts for its rights under the
    trust agreement under the cost method of accounting. The Company
    also reclassified the carrying value of its investment related
    to Borgata to “Other long-term assets, net.” Earnings
    and losses that relate to the investment that were previously
    accrued remain as a part of the carrying amount of the
    investment. Distributions received by the trust that do not
    exceed the Company’s share of earnings are recognized
    currently in earnings. However, distributions to the trust that
    exceed the Company’s share of earnings for such periods are
    applied to reduce the carrying amount of its investment. The
    trust received net distributions from the joint venture of
    $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. The
    Company recorded $94 million as a reduction of the carrying
    value and $19 million was recorded as “Other,
    net” non-operating income in the year ended
    December 31, 2010.

In connection with the settlement agreement discussed above, the
    Company entered into an amendment to its joint venture agreement
    with Boyd to permit the transfer of its 50% ownership interest
    into trust in connection with the Company’s settlement
    agreement with the DGE. In accordance with such agreement, Boyd
    received a priority



partnership distribution of approximately $31 million
    (equal to the excess prior capital contributions by Boyd) upon
    successful refinancing of the Borgata credit facility in August
    2010.

In July 2010, the Company entered into an agreement to sell four
    long-term ground leases and their respective underlying real
    property parcels, approximately 11 acres, underlying the
    Borgata. The transaction closed in November 2010 and the Company
    received net proceeds of $71 million and recorded a gain of
    $3 million related to the sale in “Property
    transactions, net.”

In October 2010, the Company received an offer for its 50%
    economic interest in the Borgata based on an enterprise value of
    $1.35 billion for the entire asset and on October 12,
    2010, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
    submission of this offer to Boyd in accordance with the right of
    first refusal provisions included in the joint venture
    agreement. Subsequently, Boyd announced that it does not intend
    to exercise its right of refusal in connection with such offer.
    Based on Borgata’s September debt balances, the offer
    equated to slightly in excess of $250 million for the
    Company’s 50% interest. This was less than the carrying
    value of the Company’s investment in Borgata; therefore,
    the Company recorded an impairment charge of approximately
    $128 million at September 30, 2010, recorded in
    “Property transactions, net.” Since October 2010, the
    Company has continued to negotiate with the prospective
    purchaser as well as other parties that have expressed interest
    in the asset. There can be no assurance that the transaction
    will be completed as proposed or at all, and the final terms of
    any sale may differ materially from the ones disclosed above.

Macau

In September, 2010, MGM China Holdings Limited, a Cayman Islands
    company formed by the Company and Ms. Pansy Ho, that would
    own the entity that operates MGM Macau, filed a proposed listing
    application on Form A1 with The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
    Limited (“Hong Kong Exchange”) in connection with a
    possible listing of its shares on the main board of the Hong
    Kong Exchange. There have not been any decisions made regarding
    the timing or terms of any such listing, whether MGM China
    Holdings Limited will ultimately proceed with this transaction,
    or whether the application will be approved by the Hong Kong
    Exchange.

The Company received approximately $192 million from MGM
    Macau during the fourth quarter of 2010, which represents a full
    repayment of its interest and non-interest bearing notes to that
    entity. The Company recognized $59 million (representing
    cumulative equity method earnings to date recognized by the
    Company) of such distributions as a cash flow from operating
    activities and $133 million as a cash flow from investing
    activities in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash
    flows.

Basis
    Differences

The Company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates do
    not equal the venture-level equity due to various basis
    differences. Basis differences related to depreciable assets are
    being amortized based on the useful lives of the related assets
    and liabilities and basis differences related to non –
    depreciable assets are not being amortized. Differences between
    the Company’s venture-level equity and investment balances

$

There were no changes in the recorded balances of goodwill in
    2010 or 2009. Goodwill remaining for the Mirage Resorts
    acquisition relates to Bellagio and The Mirage. The estimated
    fair values of Bellagio and Mirage are substantially in excess
    of their carrying values including goodwill. Goodwill related to
    the Mandalay Resort Group acquisition was primarily assigned to
    Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur and Gold Strike Tunica. As a
    result of the Company’s annual impairment test of goodwill
    in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recognized a non-cash
    impairment charge of goodwill of $1.2 billion –
    included in “Property transactions, net.” Such charge
    solely related to goodwill recognized in the Mandalay
    acquisition and represents the Company’s total accumulated
    impairment losses related to goodwill since January 1, 2002
    when the Company adopted new accounting rules for goodwill and
    intangible assets. Assumptions used in such analysis were
    affected by current market conditions including: 1) lower
    market valuation multiples for gaming assets; 2) higher
    discount rates resulting from turmoil in the credit and equity
    markets; and 3) current cash flow forecasts for the
    affected resorts. The remaining balance of the Mandalay
    acquisition goodwill primarily relates to goodwill assigned to
    Gold Strike Tunica. The fair value of Gold Strike Tunica is
    substantially in excess of its carrying value including goodwill.

The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets balance of
    $334 million includes trademarks and trade names of
    $217 million related to the Mandalay acquisition. As a
    result of the Company’s annual impairment test in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 of indefinite-lived intangible assets,
    the Company recognized a non-cash impairment charge of
    $12 million – included in “Property
    transactions, net.” Such charge solely related to trade
    names recognized in the Mandalay acquisition. The fair value of
    the trade names was determined using the relief-from-royalty
    method and was negatively affected by the factors discussed
    above relating to the impairment of goodwill. The Company’s
    indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of
    development rights in Detroit and trademarks.

The Company’s remaining finite–lived intangible assets
    consist primarily of lease acquisition costs amortized over the
    life of the related leases, and certain license rights amortized
    over their contractual life.

As of December 31, 2010, long-term debt due within one year
    of the balance sheet date is classified as long-term because the
    Company has both the intent and ability to repay these amounts
    with available borrowings under



the senior credit facility. At December 31, 2009,
    outstanding senior notes due within one year of the balance
    sheet date were classified as current obligations as the
    Company’s senior credit facility was fully drawn.

Senior credit facility.

The Company’s senior
    credit facility was amended and restated in March 2010, and
    consisted of approximately $2.7 billion in term loans (of
    which approximately $874 million was required to be repaid
    by October 3, 2011) and a $2.0 billion revolving
    loan (of which approximately $302 million was required to
    be repaid by October 3, 2011). As discussed below, in
    November 2010, the Company repaid the outstanding balance of the
    loans maturing in October 3, 2011. As of December 31,
    2010, the Company’s senior credit facility consisted of
    approximately $1.8 billion in term loans and
    $1.7 billion in revolving loans and had approximately
    $1.2 billion of available revolving borrowing capacity.

Interest on the senior credit facility is based on a LIBOR
    margin of 5.00%, with a LIBOR floor of 2.00%, and a base rate
    margin of 4.00%, with a base rate floor of 4.00%. The weighted
    average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the senior
    credit facility at December 31, 2010 and December 31,
    2009 was 7.0% and 6.0%, respectively.

The Company accounted for the modification related to the
    extending term loans as an extinguishment of debt because the
    applicable cash flows under the extended term loans were more
    than 10% different from the applicable cash flows under the
    previous loans. Therefore, the extended term loans were recorded
    at fair value resulting in a $181 million gain and a
    discount of $181 million to be amortized to interest
    expense over the term of the extended term loans. In the year
    ended December 31, 2010, the Company recognized
    $31 million of interest expense related to such discount
    amortization. Fair value of the estimated term loans was based
    on trading prices immediately after the transaction. In
    addition, the Company wrote off $15 million of existing
    debt issuance costs related to the previous term loans and
    expensed $22 million for new debt issuance costs incurred
    related to amounts paid to extending term loan lenders in
    connection with the modification. The Company also wrote off
    $2 million of existing debt issuance costs related to the
    reduction in capacity under the non-extending revolving portion
    of the senior credit facility. In total, the Company recognized
    a net pre-tax gain on extinguishment of debt of
    $142 million in “Other, net” non-operating income
    in the first quarter of 2010.

Because net proceeds from the Company’s October 2010 common
    stock offering were in excess of $500 million, the Company
    was required to ratably repay indebtedness under the senior
    credit facility of $6 million, which equaled 50% of such
    excess. The Company used the net proceeds from its October 2010
    senior notes offering and a portion of the net proceeds from its
    October 2010 common stock offering discussed in Note 11 to
    repay the remaining amounts owed to non-extending lenders under
    its senior credit facility. Loans and revolving commitments
    aggregating approximately $3.6 billion were extended to
    February 21, 2014. In November 2010, the underwriters of
    the Company’s common stock offering exercised their
    overallotment option and purchased an additional
    6.1 million shares for net proceeds to the Company of
    $76 million, 50% of which was used to ratably repay
    indebtedness under the senior credit facility. As a result of
    these transactions the Company recorded a pre-tax loss on
    retirement of debt related to unamortized debt issuance costs
    and discounts of $9 million recorded in “Other,
    net” non-operating revenue in the fourth quarter.

The restated senior credit facility allows the Company to
    refinance indebtedness maturing prior to February 21, 2014,
    but limits its ability to prepay later maturing indebtedness
    until the extended facilities are paid in full. The Company may
    issue unsecured debt, equity-linked and equity securities to
    refinance its outstanding indebtedness; however, the Company is
    required to use net proceeds (a) from indebtedness issued
    in amounts in excess of $250 million over amounts used to
    refinance indebtedness and (b) from equity issued, other
    than in exchange for its



indebtedness, in amounts in excess of $500 million (which
    limit the Company reached with its October 2010 stock offering)
    to ratably prepay the credit facilities, in each case, in an
    amount equal to 50% of the net cash proceeds of such excess.

The senior credit facility contains certain financial and
    non-financial covenants, including a quarterly minimum EBITDA
    test, based on a rolling

12-month

EBITDA and a covenant limiting annual capital expenditures.
    Further, the senior credit facility and certain of the
    Company’s debt securities contain restrictive covenants
    that, among other things, limit its ability to pay dividends or
    distributions, repurchase or issue equity, prepay debt or make
    certain investments; incur additional debt or issue certain
    disqualified stock and preferred stock; incur liens on assets;
    pledge or sell assets or consolidate with another company or
    sell all or substantially all assets; enter into transactions
    with affiliates; allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets;
    and enter into sale and lease-back transactions. The Company is
    in compliance with all covenants, including financial covenants
    under its senior credit facilities as of December 31, 2010.

At December 31, 2010, the Company was required under its
    senior credit facility to maintain a minimum trailing annual
    EBITDA (as defined) of $1.0 billion, which increases to
    $1.1 billion as of March 31, 2011, $1.15 billion
    as of September 30, 2011, and $1.2 billion as of
    December 31, 2011, with additional periodic increases
    thereafter. As of December 31, 2010, the Company had annual
    EBITDA calculated in accordance with the terms of the agreement
    of approximately $1.14 billion and was in compliance with
    the minimum EBITDA covenant. Additionally, the Company is
    limited to $400 million of annual capital expenditures (as
    defined) during 2010. At December 31, 2010, the Company was
    in compliance with the maximum capital expenditures covenant.

The Company and each of its subsidiaries, excluding MGM Grand
    Detroit, LLC, the Company’s foreign subsidiaries and their
    U.S. holding companies and the Company’s insurance
    subsidiaries, are directly liable for or unconditionally
    guarantee the senior credit facility, senior notes, senior
    debentures, and senior subordinated notes. MGM Grand Detroit,
    LLC is a guarantor under the senior credit facility, but only to
    the extent that MGM Grand Detroit, LLC borrows under such
    facilities. At December 31, 2010, the outstanding amount of
    borrowings related to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC was
    $450 million. See Note 16 for consolidating condensed
    financial information of the subsidiary guarantors and
    non-guarantors.

Senior notes.

In February 2010, the Company repaid
    the $297 million of outstanding principal amount of its
    9.375% senior subordinated notes due 2010 at maturity.
    During the second quarter of 2010, the Company repurchased
    $136 million principal amount of its 8.5% senior notes
    due 2010 and $75 million principal amount of its
    8.375% senior notes due 2011 essentially at par. In
    September 2010, the Company repaid the remaining
    $646 million of outstanding principal of its
    8.5% senior notes due 2010 at maturity.

In March 2010, the Company issued $845 million of
    9% senior secured notes due 2020 for net proceeds to the
    Company of approximately $826 million. The notes are
    secured by the equity interests and substantially all of the
    assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and otherwise rank equally in
    right of payment with the Company’s existing and future
    senior indebtedness. Upon the issuance of such notes, the
    holders of the Company’s 13% senior notes due 2013
    obtained an equal and ratable lien in all collateral securing
    these notes. The Company used the net proceeds from the senior
    note issuance to permanently repay approximately
    $820 million of loans previously outstanding under its
    credit facility.

In October 2010, the Company issued $500 million of
    10% senior notes due 2016, issued at a discount to yield
    10.25%, for net proceeds to the Company of approximately
    $486 million. The notes are unsecured and otherwise rank
    equally in right of payment with the Company’s existing and
    future senior indebtedness.

During 2009, the Company executed the following transactions
    related to its senior notes and senior secured notes:

•

In May, 2009, issued $650 million of 10.375% senior
    secured notes due 2014 and $850 million of
    11.125% senior secured notes due 2017 for total net
    proceeds to the Company of approximately $1.4 billion;

•

In June, 2009, redeemed $100 million of 7.25% senior
    debentures at a cost of $127 million, $762.6 million
    of 6.0% senior notes due October 2009, essentially at par,
    and $122.3 million of 6.5% senior notes due July



2009, essentially at par and recorded a loss on early retirement
    of debt of $38 million related to these transactions in
    “Other, net;”

•

In September 2009, issued $475 million of
    11.375% senior notes due 2018 for net proceeds to the
    Company of $451 million; and

•

In October 2009, redeemed the remaining $57.4 million of
    its 6.0% notes at maturity.

Senior convertible notes.

In April 2010, the Company
    issued $1.15 billion of 4.25% convertible senior notes due
    2015 for net proceeds to the Company of $1.12 billion. The
    notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company and rank
    equally in right of payment with the Company’s other
    existing senior unsecured indebtedness. The Company used the net
    proceeds from the senior convertible note issuance to
    temporarily repay amounts outstanding under its senior credit
    facility.

The notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of
    approximately 53.83 shares of the Company’s common
    stock per $1,000 principal amount of the notes, representing an
    initial conversion price of approximately $18.58 per share of
    the Company’s common stock. The initial conversion rate was
    determined based on the closing trading price of the
    Company’s common stock on the date of the transaction, plus
    a 27.5% premium. The terms of the notes do not provide for any
    beneficial conversion features.

In connection with the offering, the Company entered into capped
    call transactions to reduce the potential dilution of the
    Company’s stock upon conversion of the notes. The capped
    call transactions have a cap price equal to approximately $21.86
    per share. The Company paid approximately $81 million for
    the capped call transactions, which is reflected as a decrease
    in “Capital in excess of par value,” net of
    $29 million of associated tax benefits.

Financial instruments that are indexed to an entity’s own
    stock and are classified as stockholders’ equity in an
    entity’s statement of financial position are not considered
    within the scope of derivative instruments. The Company
    performed an evaluation of the embedded conversion option and
    capped call transactions, which included an analysis of
    contingent exercise provisions and settlement requirements, and
    determined that the embedded conversion option and capped call
    transactions are considered indexed to the Company’s stock
    and should be classified as equity, and therefore are not
    accounted for as derivative instruments. Accordingly, the entire
    face amount of the notes was recorded as debt until converted or
    retired at maturity, and the capped call transactions were
    recorded within equity as described above.

Maturities of long-term debt.

    Company’s long-term debt as of December 31, 2010 were

The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets, net of
    applicable reserves, related to net operating loss carryforwards
    and certain temporary differences. The Company recognizes future
    tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefit is
    more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is
    applied.

The 2009 components of the Company’s net deferred tax
    liability disclosed in the table above reflect adjustments to
    correct amounts previously presented. The primary impact was to
    move $349 million and $55 million of deferred tax
    liabilities from “Property and equipment” and
    “Accruals, reserves, and other,” respectively, to
    “Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates.” These
    adjustments have no impact on the Company’s consolidated
    balance sheet or statement of operations, and the Company does
    not believe the adjustments to the 2009 footnote presentation
    are material to the consolidated financial statements.

As of December 31, 2010, the Company has excess financial
    reporting basis over the tax basis of its foreign corporate
    joint venture in Macau in the amount of $37 million that
    management does not consider to be essentially



permanent in duration. The Company has not provided deferred
    taxes for such excess because there would be sufficient
    creditable foreign taxes to offset all U.S. income tax that
    would result from the future repatriation of the foreign
    earnings that created such excess basis.

For U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company generated
    in 2010 a net operating loss of $1.2 billion and general
    business tax credits of $7 million. Approximately
    $552 million of the net operating loss will be carried back
    to prior tax years. Consequently, the Company has recorded the
    expected refund from this carryback in “Income tax
    receivable” at December 31, 2010. The remaining
    $645 million of the net operating loss will be carried
    forward and will expire if not utilized by 2030. In addition,
    the carryback will create an alternative minimum tax credit
    carryforward of $12 million that will not expire and a
    general business tax credit carryforward of $6 million that
    will expire if not utilized by 2029. The general business tax
    credit of $7 million generated in 2010 will expire if not
    utilized by 2030. The Company has a charitable contribution
    carryforward of $5 million that will begin to expire in
    2014 and a foreign tax credit carryforward of $2 million
    that will expire if not utilized by 2015.

The Company at December 31, 2010, was close to the
    ownership change threshold set forth in Internal Revenue Code
    section 382 as a result of transactions in its stock over
    the past several years. Should an ownership change occur in a
    future period, the Company’s U.S. federal income tax
    net operating losses and tax credits incurred prior to the
    ownership change would generally be subject to a post-change
    annual usage limitation equal to the value of the Company at the
    time of the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax
    exempt rate at such time as established by the IRS. The Company
    does not anticipate that this limitation would prevent the
    utilization of the Company’s net operating losses and tax
    credits prior to their expiration or materially impact the cash
    taxes payable in future years.

For state income tax purposes, the Company has Illinois and
    Michigan net operating loss carryforwards of $46 million
    and $154 million, respectively, which equates to deferred
    tax assets, after federal tax effect and before valuation
    allowance, of $2 million and $6 million, respectively.
    The Illinois and Michigan net operating loss carryforwards will
    begin to expire if not utilized by 2021 and 2019, respectively.
    The Company has New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards of
    $49 million, which equates to a deferred tax asset of
    $3 million, after federal tax effect, and before valuation
    allowance. The New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards will
    expire if not utilized by various dates from 2011 through 2030.

On January 13, 2011, the state of Illinois enacted
    increases to its corporate income tax rate and also suspended
    the use of net operating loss carryforwards for three years,
    effective beginning 2011. The Company does not anticipate that
    these tax law changes will have a material impact on its
    Illinois deferred tax liability.

At December 31, 2010, there is a $34 million valuation
    allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain state
    deferred tax assets. In addition, there is a valuation allowance
    of $2 million on the foreign tax credit because management
    believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than
    not” criteria for recognition. Given the negative impact of
    the U.S. economy on the results of operations in the past
    several years and expectations that the Company will continue to
    be adversely affected by certain aspects of the current economic
    conditions, the Company no longer relies on future operating
    income in assessing the realizability of its deferred tax assets
    and now relies only on the future reversal of existing taxable
    temporary differences. Accordingly, the Company concluded during
    2010 that realization of certain of its state deferred tax
    assets was no longer more likely than not and the Company
    provided an additional valuation allowance in the amount of
    $32 million, net of federal effect, with a corresponding
    reduction in income tax benefit. Since the future reversal of
    existing U.S. federal taxable temporary differences
    currently exceeds the future reversal of existing
    U.S. federal deductible temporary differences, the Company
    continued to conclude that it is more likely than not that its
    U.S. federal deferred tax assets, other than the foreign tax
    credit carryforward, are realizable. Should the Company continue
    to experience operating losses of the same magnitude it has
    experienced in the past several years, it is reasonably possible
    in the near term that the future reversal of its
    U.S. federal deductible temporary differences could exceed
    the future reversal of its U.S. federal taxable temporary
    differences, in which case the Company would record a valuation
    allowance for such excess with a corresponding reduction of
    federal income tax benefit on its statement of operations.

The Company assesses its tax positions using a two-step process.
    A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely
    than not” threshold, and is measured at the largest amount
    of benefit that is greater than 50 percent



likely of being realized. Uncertain tax positions must be
    reviewed at each balance sheet date. Liabilities recorded as a
    result of this analysis must generally be recorded separately
    from any current or deferred income tax accounts, and at
    December 31, 2010, the Company has classified
    $16 million as current in “Other accrued
    liabilities” and $144 million as long-term in
    “Other long-term obligations,” based on the time until
    expected payment.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross
    unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was
    $30 million and $34 million at December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. The Company had
    $26 million and $24 million in interest related to
    unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of December 31, 2010
    and 2009, respectively. No amounts were accrued for penalties as
    of either date. Income tax expense for the years ended
    December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 includes interest related
    to unrecognized tax benefits of $8 million,
    $8 million, and $6 million, respectively.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal
    jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign
    jurisdictions, although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions
    are not material. As of December 31, 2010, the Company is
    no longer subject to examination of its U.S. consolidated
    federal income tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2005.
    The IRS completed its examination of the Company’s
    consolidated federal income tax returns for the 2003 and 2004
    tax years during 2010 and the Company paid $12 million in
    tax and $4 million in associated interest with respect to
    adjustments to which it agreed. In addition, the Company
    submitted a protest to IRS Appeals of certain adjustments to
    which it does not agree. The opening Appeals conference has been
    scheduled to occur in the first quarter of 2011. It is
    reasonably possible that the issues subject to Appeal may be
    settled within the next 12 months. During the fourth
    quarter of 2010, the IRS opened an examination of the
    Company’s consolidated federal income tax returns for the
    2005 through 2009 tax years.

The IRS informed the Company during the fourth quarter of 2010
    that they would initiate an audit of the 2007 through 2009 tax
    years of CityCenter Holdings LLC, an unconsolidated affiliate
    treated as a partnership for income tax purposes. The IRS also
    informed the Company that they would initiate an audit of the
    2008 through 2009 tax years of MGM Grand Detroit LLC, a
    subsidiary treated as a partnership for income tax purposes.
    Neither of these audits were initiated in 2010 but the Company
    anticipates that both will be initiated in early 2011.

The Company reached settlement during 2010 with IRS Appeals with
    respect to the audit of the 2004 through 2006 tax years of MGM
    Grand Detroit, LLC. At issue was the tax treatment of payments
    made under an agreement to develop, own and operate a hotel
    casino in the City of Detroit. The Company will owe
    $1 million in tax as a result of this settlement.

During the fourth quarter of 2010, the Company and its joint
    venture partner reached tentative settlement with IRS Appeals
    with respect to the audit of the 2003 and 2004 tax years of a
    cost method investee of the Company’s that is treated as a
    partnership for income tax purposes. The adjustments to which
    the Company agreed in such settlement will be included in any
    settlement that it may reach with respect to the 2003 and 2004
    examination of its consolidated federal income tax return.

The IRS closed during 2010 its examination of the federal income
    tax return of Mandalay Resort Group for the



pre-acquisition year ended April 25, 2005 and issued a
    “No-Change Letter.” The statute of limitations for
    assessing tax for all Mandalay Resort Group pre-acquisition
    years are now closed.

As of December 31, 2010, other than the exceptions noted
    below, the Company was no longer subject to examination of its
    various state and local tax returns filed for years ended prior
    to 2006. The state of Illinois during 2010 initiated an audit of
    its Illinois combined returns for the 2006 and 2007 tax years.
    It is reasonably possible that this audit will close and all
    issues will be settled in the next 12 months. The state of
    New Jersey began audit procedures during 2010 of a cost method
    investee of the Company’s for the 2003 through 2006 tax
    years. The City of Detroit previously indicated that it would
    audit a Mandalay Resort Group subsidiary return for the
    pre-acquisition year ended April 25 but no audit was initiated
    and the statute of limitations for assessing tax expired in
    2010. No other state or local income tax returns of the
    Company’s are currently under exam.

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the
    total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
    2010 may decrease by a range of $0 to $28 million
    within the next twelve months on the expectation during such
    period of possible settlement of certain issues under appeal in
    connection with the IRS audit of the Company’s 2003 and
    2004 consolidated federal income tax returns.

NOTE 10 —

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases.

The Company leases real estate and various
    equipment under operating and, to a lesser extent, capital lease
    arrangements. Certain real estate leases provide for escalation
    of rent based upon a specified price index

and/or

based
    upon periodic appraisals.

At December 31, 2010, the Company was obligated under
    non-cancellable operating leases and capital leases to make
    future minimum lease payments as follows:

    expense for operating leases, including rental expense of
    discontinued operations, was $26 million for 2010,
    $24 million for 2009, and $29 million for 2008.

CityCenter completion guarantee.

The Company entered
    into a completion guarantee requiring an unlimited completion
    and cost overrun guarantee from the Company, secured by its
    interests in the assets of Circus Circus Las Vegas and certain
    adjacent undeveloped land. The terms of the completion guarantee
    provide for the ability to utilize up to $250 million of
    net residential proceeds to fund construction costs, though the
    timing of receipt of such proceeds is uncertain.

As of December 31, 2010 the Company has funded
    $553 million under the completion guarantee. The Company
    has recorded a receivable from CityCenter of $124 million
    related to these amounts, which represents amounts reimbursable
    to the Company from CityCenter from future residential proceeds.
    The Company has a



remaining estimated net obligation under the completion
    guarantee of $80 million which includes estimated
    litigation costs related to the resolution of disputes with
    contractors as to the final construction costs and reflects
    certain estimated offsets to the amounts claimed by the
    contractors. CityCenter has reached, or expects to reach,
    settlement agreements with most of the construction
    subcontractors. However, significant disputes remain with the
    general contractor and certain subcontractors. Amounts claimed
    by such parties exceed amounts included in the Company’s
    completion guarantee accrual by approximately $200 million.
    Moreover, the Company has not accrued for any contingent
    payments to CityCenter related to the Harmon Hotel &
    Spa component, which is unlikely to be completed using the
    building as it now stands. The Company does not believe it would
    be responsible for funding any additional remediation efforts
    that might be required with respect to the Harmon; however, the
    Company’s view is based on a number of developing factors,
    including with respect to on-going litigation with
    CityCenter’s contractors, actions by local officials and
    other developments related to the CityCenter venture, that are
    subject to change.

In January 2011, the Company entered into an amended completion
    and cost overrun guarantee in connection with CityCenter’s
    restated senior credit facility agreement and issuance of
    $1.5 billion of senior secured first lien notes and senior
    secured second lien notes, as previously discussed. Consistent
    with the terms of the previous completion guarantee, the terms
    of the amended completion guarantee provide for the ability to
    utilize the remaining $124 million of net residential
    proceeds to fund construction costs, or to reimburse the Company
    for construction costs previously expended, though the timing of
    receipt of such proceeds is uncertain.

CityCenter construction litigation.

In March 2010,
    Perini Building Company, Inc., general contractor for the
    CityCenter development project (the “Project”), filed
    a lawsuit in the Eighth Judicial District Court for Clark
    County, State of Nevada, against MGM MIRAGE Design Group (a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company which was the original
    party to the Perini construction agreement) and certain direct
    or indirect subsidiaries of CityCenter Holdings, LLC (the
    “CityCenter Owners”). Perini asserts that the Project
    was substantially completed, but the defendants failed to pay
    Perini approximately $490 million allegedly due and owing
    under the construction agreement for labor, equipment and
    materials expended on the Project. The complaint further charges
    the defendants with failure to provide timely and complete
    design documents, late delivery to Perini of design changes,
    mismanagement of the change order process, obstruction of
    Perini’s ability to complete the Harmon Hotel &
    Spa component, and fraudulent inducement of Perini to compromise
    significantly amounts due for its general conditions. The
    complaint advances claims for breach of contract, breach of the
    implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious breach
    of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust
    enrichment and promissory estoppel, and fraud and intentional
    misrepresentation. Perini seeks compensatory damages, punitive
    damages, attorneys’ fees and costs.

In April 2010, Perini served an amended complaint in this case
    which joins as defendants many owners of CityCenter residential
    condominium units (the “Condo Owner Defendants”), adds
    a count for foreclosure of Perini’s recorded master
    mechanic’s lien against the CityCenter property in the
    amount of approximately $491 million, and asserts the
    priority of this mechanic’s lien over the interests of the
    CityCenter Owners, the Condo Owner Defendants and the Project
    lenders in the CityCenter property.

The CityCenter Owners and the other defendants dispute
    Perini’s allegations, and contend that the defendants are
    entitled to substantial amounts from Perini, including offsets
    against amounts claimed to be owed to Perini and its
    subcontractors and damages based on breach of their contractual
    and other duties to CityCenter, duplicative payment requests,
    non-conforming work, lack of proof of alleged work performance,
    defective work related to the Harmon Hotel & Spa
    component, property damage and Perini’s failure to perform
    its obligations to pay Project subcontractors and to prevent
    filing of liens against the Project. Parallel to the court
    litigation CityCenter management conducted an extra-judicial
    program for settlement of Project subcontractor claims.
    CityCenter has resolved the claims of the majority of the 223
    first-tier subcontractors, with only several remaining for
    further proceedings along with trial of Perini’s claims and
    CityCenter’s Harmon-related counterclaim and other claims
    by CityCenter against Perini and its parent guarantor, Tutor
    Perini. In December 2010, Perini recorded an amended notice of
    lien reducing its lien to approximately $313 million.

The CityCenter Owners and the other defendants will continue to
    vigorously assert and protect their interests in



the lawsuit. The range of loss beyond the claims asserted to
    date by Perini or any gain the joint venture may realize related
    to the defendants’ counterclaims cannot be reasonably
    estimated at this time.

Other litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters
    incidental to its business. Management does not believe that the
    outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect
    on the Company’s financial position, results of operations
    or cash flows.

Other guarantees.

The Company is party to various
    guarantee contracts in the normal course of business, which are
    generally supported by letters of credit issued by financial
    institutions. The Company’s senior credit facility limits
    the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to
    $250 million, and the amount of available borrowings under
    the senior credit facility is reduced by any outstanding letters
    of credit. At December 31, 2010, the Company had provided
    $37 million of total letters of credit.

NOTE 11 —

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

2010 stock offering.

In October 2010, the Company
    issued 40.9 million shares of its common stock for total
    net proceeds to the Company of $512 million. Concurrently
    with the Company’s issuance, Tracinda sold approximately
    27.8 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The
    Company did not receive any proceeds from the sale of such
    common stock by Tracinda. In November 2010, the underwriter
    exercised its ability to purchase an additional 6.1 million
    shares from the Company and 4.2 million shares from
    Tracinda to cover overallotments, with net proceeds to the
    Company of approximately $76 million. Proceeds from the
    common stock offering were used to repay outstanding amounts
    under the Company’s senior credit facility (see
    Note 8) and for general corporate purposes. Giving
    effect to the common stock offering, the Company has
    approximately 3.3 million authorized shares in excess of
    its outstanding shares, the underwriter’s overallotment
    option, and shares underlying its outstanding convertible senior
    notes and share-based awards.

2009 stock offering.

In May 2009, the Company issued
    approximately 164.5 million shares, including approximately
    21.5 million shares issued as a result of the underwriters
    exercising their over-allotment option, of its common stock at
    $7 per share, for total net proceeds to the Company of
    approximately $1.1 billion. A portion of the shares were
    previously held by the Company as treasury stock and a portion
    of the shares were newly issued. Proceeds from the common stock
    offering and concurrent offering of senior secured notes were
    used to repay outstanding amounts under the Company’s
    senior credit facility and redeem certain outstanding senior
    debentures and senior notes and for general corporate purposes.

Stock repurchases.

Share repurchases are only
    conducted under repurchase programs approved by the Board of
    Directors and publicly announced. At December 31, 2010, the
    Company had 20 million shares available for repurchase
    under the May 2008 authorization, subject to limitations under
    the Company’s agreements governing its long-term
    indebtedness. The Company did not repurchase any shares during
    2010 or 2009. The Company repurchased 18.1 million shares
    in 2008 for $1.24 billion and an average price of $68.36.

NOTE 12 —

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Information about the Company’s share-based
    awards.

The Company adopted an omnibus incentive plan
    in 2005 which, as amended, allows it to grant stock options,
    stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock,
    restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and other stock-based
    awards to eligible directors, officers and employees of the
    Company and its subsidiaries. The plans are administered by the
    Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board
    of Directors. The Committee has discretion under the omnibus
    plan regarding which type of awards to grant, the vesting and
    service requirements, exercise price and other conditions, in
    all cases subject to certain limits, including:

•

As amended, the omnibus plan allows for the issuance of up to
    35 million (20 million prior to an August 2008
    amendment) shares or share-based awards; and

•

For stock options and SARs, the exercise price of the award must
    be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock on the
    date of grant and the maximum term of such an award is
    10 years.

Stock options and SARs granted under all plans generally have
    terms of either seven or ten years, and in most cases vest in
    either four or five equal annual installments. RSUs granted vest
    ratably over 4 years. The Company’s practice is to
    issue new shares upon exercise or vesting of awards.



Activity under share-based payment plans.

As of
    December 31, 2010, the Company had an aggregate of
    approximately 11 million shares of common stock available
    for grant as share-based awards under the Company’s omnibus
    incentive plan. Such capacity is limited to 3.3 million
    shares as a result of the Company’s fourth quarter 2010
    common stock offering discussed in Note 11. A summary of
    activity under the Company’s share-based payment plans for
    the year ended December 31, 2010 is presented below:

In 2009, the Company began to net settle stock option exercises,
    whereby shares of common stock are issued equivalent to the
    intrinsic value of the option less applicable taxes.
    Accordingly, the Company no longer receives proceeds from the
    exercise of stock options.

As of December 31, 2010, there was a total of
    $58 million of unamortized compensation related to stock
    options and stock appreciation rights expected to vest, which is
    expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of
    2.0 years. As of December 31, 2010, there was a total
    of $36 million of unamortized compensation related



to restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized
    over a weighted-average period of 1.5 years.
    $27 million of such unamortized compensation relates to the
    RSUs granted in the Company’s 2008 exchange offer. RSUs
    granted to corporate officers are subject to certain performance
    requirements determined by the Committee. Such performance
    requirements do not apply to RSUs granted in the exchange offer.

Recognition of compensation cost.

The Company
    recognizes the estimated fair value of stock options and SARs
    granted under the Company’s omnibus plan based on the
    estimated fair value of these awards measured at the date of
    grant using the Black-Scholes model. For restricted stock units,
    compensation cost is calculated based on the fair market value
    of its stock on the date of grant. For stock options awards
    granted prior to January 1, 2006, the unamortized expense
    is being recognized on an accelerated basis. For all awards
    granted after January 1, 2006, such expense is being
    recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of
    the awards. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, with
    such estimate updated periodically and with actual forfeitures
    recognized currently to the extent they differ from the
    estimate. The Company capitalizes stock-based compensation
    related to employees dedicated to construction activities. In
    addition, the Company charges CityCenter for stock-based
    compensation related to employees dedicated to CityCenter.

Expected volatility is based in part on historical volatility
    and in part on implied volatility based on traded options on the
    Company’s stock. The expected term considers the
    contractual term of the option as well as historical exercise
    and forfeiture behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on
    the rates in effect on the grant date for U.S. Treasury
    instruments with maturities matching the relevant expected term
    of the award.

NOTE 13 —

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

Employees of the Company who are members of various unions are
    covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained,
    multi-employer health and welfare and defined benefit pension
    plans. The Company recorded an



expense of $205 million in 2010, $177 million in 2009,
    and $192 million in 2008 under such plans. The plans’
    sponsors have not provided sufficient information to permit the
    Company to determine its share of unfunded vested benefits, if
    any.

The Company is self-insured for most health care benefits and
    workers compensation for its non-union employees. The liability
    for health care claims filed and estimates of claims incurred
    but not reported was $18 million and $20 million at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The workers
    compensation liability for claims filed and estimates of claims
    incurred but not reported was $24 million and
    $27 million as of December 31, 2010 and
    December 31, 2009, respectively. Both liabilities are
    included in “Other accrued liabilities.”

The Company has retirement savings plans under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for eligible
    employees. The plans allow employees to defer, within prescribed
    limits, up to 30% of their income on a pre-tax basis through
    contributions to the plans. The Company suspended contributions
    to the plan in 2009, though certain employees at MGM Grand
    Detroit and Four Seasons were still eligible for matching
    contributions. In the case of certain union employees, the
    Company contributions to the plan are based on hours worked. The
    Company recorded charges for 401(k) contributions of
    $3 million in 2010, $2 million in 2009 and
    $25 million in 2008. The Company reinstated a more limited
    401(k) company contribution in 2011 and will continue to monitor
    the plan contributions as the economy changes.

The Company maintains nonqualified deferred retirement plans for
    certain key employees. The plans allow participants to defer, on
    a pre-tax basis, a portion of their salary and bonus and
    accumulate tax deferred earnings, plus investment earnings on
    the deferred balances, as a deferred tax savings. Through
    December 31, 2008 participants earned a Company match of up
    to 4% of salary, net of any Company match received under the
    Company’s 401(k) plan. In 2009, the Company suspended
    contributions to the plan. All employee deferrals vest
    immediately. The Company matching contributions vest ratably
    over a three-year period. The Company recorded charges for
    matching contributions of $1 million in 2008.

The Company also maintains nonqualified supplemental executive
    retirement plans (“SERP”) for certain key employees.
    Until September 2008, the Company made quarterly contributions
    intended to provide a retirement benefit that is a fixed
    percentage of a participant’s estimated final five-year
    average annual salary, up to a maximum of 65%. The Company has
    indefinitely suspended these contributions. Employees do not
    make contributions under these plans. A portion of the Company
    contributions and investment earnings thereon vest after three
    years of SERP participation and the remaining portion vests
    after both five years of SERP participation and 10 years of
    continuous service. The Company recorded expense under this plan
    of $4 million in 2008.

Pursuant to the amendments of the nonqualified deferred
    retirement plans and SERP plans during 2008, and consistent with
    certain transitional relief provided by the Internal Revenue
    Service pursuant to rules governing nonqualified deferred
    compensation, the Company permitted participants under the plans
    to make a one-time election to receive, without penalty, all or
    a portion of their respective vested account balances. Based on
    elections made, the Company made payments to participants of
    $62 million in 2009. In addition, the Company made payments
    of $57 million to participants in 2008 related to previous
    versions of these plans that were terminated during the year.

Because income per share amounts are calculated using the
    weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent
    shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share
    amounts for the four quarters does not equal the total income
    per share amounts for the year.

As discussed in Note 5, in 2010 the Company recorded a
    $1.3 billion impairment charge related to its CityCenter
    investment and a $166 million charge related to its share
    of the CityCenter residential real estate impairment. The
    impairment of the CityCenter investment was recorded in the
    second and third quarters and resulted in an impact to diluted
    loss per share of $1.64 in the second quarter, $0.27 in the
    third quarter, and $1.88 for the full year of 2010. The
    residential real estate impairment charges were recorded in each
    of the four quarters of 2010. The impact to diluted loss per
    share was $0.13 in the first quarter, $0.04 in the second
    quarter, $0.07 in the third quarter, $0.02 in the fourth quarter
    and $0.24 on the full year of 2010.

As discussed in Note 5, the Company recorded a
    $128 million impairment charge related to its investment in
    Borgata. The impairment was recorded in the third quarter of
    2010, and resulted in a $0.17 impact on third quarter of 2010
    diluted loss per share and a $0.18 impact on full year 2010
    diluted loss per share.

As discussed in Note 9, the Company recorded a
    $32 million reduction in the Company’s income tax
    benefit as a result of providing reserves for certain
    state-level deferred tax assets. The reduction was recorded in
    the fourth quarter of 2010, and resulted in a $0.07 impact on
    fourth quarter diluted loss per share and a $0.07 impact on full
    year 2010 diluted loss per share.

As discussed in Note 5, in 2009 the Company recorded a
    $956 million impairment charge related to its CityCenter
