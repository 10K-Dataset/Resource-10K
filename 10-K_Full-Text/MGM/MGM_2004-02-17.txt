PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

MGM MIRAGE is referred to as the “Company” or the “Registrant,”
and may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our”. The Company,
formerly known as MGM Grand, Inc., is one of the largest gaming
companies in the world. We own what we believe to be the world’s
finest collection of casino resorts. Our strategy is predicated on
creating resorts of memorable character, treating our employees well
and providing superior service for our guests. The Company was
organized as a Delaware corporation on January 29, 1986. We have
grown significantly through the March 1, 1999 acquisition of
Primadonna Resorts, Inc. and the May 31, 2000 acquisition of Mirage
Resorts, Incorporated (“Mirage Resorts” or “Mirage”).

Our Operating Casino Resorts

We have provided below certain information about our casino
resorts as of December 31, 2003, excluding the Golden Nugget Las Vegas
and the Golden Nugget Laughlin. We completed the sale of the
subsidiaries operating these resorts (the “Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries”) in January 2004. Except as otherwise indicated, we
wholly own and operate the resorts shown below.


Las Vegas Strip Resorts

Bellagio

Bellagio is an elegant European-style luxury resort located on an
approximately 90-acre site with 1,450 feet of frontage at the center
of the Las Vegas Strip. The resort overlooks an eight-acre lake
inspired by Lake Como in Northern Italy. Each day, more than 1,000
fountains in the lake come alive at regular intervals in a
choreographed ballet of water, music and lights. Bellagio features
casual and gourmet restaurants in both indoor and outdoor settings,
including the world-famous Le Cirque, Olives, Aqua and Picasso
restaurants; upscale retail boutiques, including those leased to
Armani, Chanel, Gucci, Hermes, Prada, Fred Leighton, Tiffany & Co.
and Yves Saint Laurent; and extensive meeting, convention and banquet
space. Bellagio’s specially designed theatre is home to the
spectacular show

“O”

produced and performed by the talented Cirque du
Soleil organization. Bellagio also offers Light, an upscale
nightclub, Caramel, a sophisticated lounge and nightclub, as well as
several other bars and lounges. The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art
features rotating exhibitions of original masterpieces from museums
and private collections. The surroundings of Bellagio are lushly
landscaped with classical gardens and European fountains and pools.
Inside, a botanical conservatory is filled with vibrant colors and
pleasing scents that change with the seasons. Bellagio has received
the prestigious Five Diamond award from AAA for the last three years,
as has Picasso. Le Cirque also earned the award in 2003.

We are expanding Bellagio with the addition of a new Spa Tower,
which will add 928 guest rooms and suites and new restaurant, retail and
meeting space, and expand the existing spa and salon facilities. We
expect to complete the expansion in late 2004. We are also in the
process of remodeling all of Bellagio’s existing standard rooms.

MGM Grand Las Vegas – The City of Entertainment

MGM Grand Las Vegas is a destination resort located on
approximately 116 acres, with over 350 feet of frontage on the Las
Vegas Strip and 1,450 feet of frontage on Tropicana Avenue. MGM Grand

and a private dining room catering to our premium gaming customers.
MGM Grand Las Vegas features an extensive array of restaurants,
including Craftsteak, opened in 2002 by the James Beard award-winning

Fiamma Trattoria, Stephen Hanson’s award-winning Italian restaurant.
Other amenities include the Studio 54 nightclub, Tabu, the Ultra
Lounge, several other bars and lounges, numerous retail shopping
outlets, a 380,000 square foot state-of-the-art conference center, and
a 6.6 acre pool and spa complex.

Entertainment facilities at MGM Grand Las Vegas include a
746-seat showroom providing celebrity entertainment and the La Femme
Theatre. The MGM Grand Garden is a special events center with a
capacity of over 16,000 seats, and provides a venue for concerts by
such stars as Madonna, Paul McCartney, Britney Spears, the Rolling
Stones, Billy Joel and others, as well as championship boxing and
other sporting events. We are currently in the process of remodeling
the former EFX! Theater for a future show by Cirque du Soleil,
expected to open in 2004.

MGM Grand Las Vegas will be the south terminal stop of a four
mile elevated public transit monorail currently being constructed by
The Las Vegas Monorail Company, a Nevada nonprofit corporation. When
completed, the monorail will connect eight hotel-casinos on the east
side of the Las Vegas Strip to the Las Vegas Convention Center. The
monorail is scheduled to open in March 2004.

The Mirage

The Mirage is a luxurious, tropically themed destination resort
located on approximately 100 acres, shared with TI, with
2,200 feet of combined Strip frontage near the center of the Las Vegas
Strip. The exterior of the resort is landscaped with palm trees,
abundant foliage and more than four acres of lagoons and other water
features centered around a 54-foot volcano and waterfall. Each
evening, the volcano erupts at regular intervals, with flames that
spectacularly illuminate the front of the resort. Inside the front
entrance is an atrium with a tropical garden and additional water
features capped by a 100-foot-high glass dome, designed to replicate
the sights, sounds and fragrances of the South Seas. Located at the
rear of the hotel, adjacent to the swimming pool area, is a dolphin
habitat with nine Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and

The Secret Garden
of Siegfried & Roy

, an attraction that allows guests to view the
beautiful exotic animals of Siegfried & Roy, the world-famous
illusionists.



The Mirage features a wide array of restaurants, including
Renoir, a recipient of the AAA Five Diamond award for the past three
years. Entertainment at The Mirage includes a show featuring Danny
Gans, the renowned singer/impersonator, in The Danny Gans Theatre.
The Mirage also has numerous retail shopping outlets and 170,000
square feet of convention space, including the 90,000-square foot
Mirage Events Center. In 2004, The Mirage will open its newly
designed buffet and a 16,000-square foot nightclub.

Treasure Island (“TI”)

TI is a Caribbean-themed hotel-casino resort located next to The
Mirage. TI and The Mirage are connected by a monorail. TI recently
launched a new branding and marketing campaign, including a new logo
and new marquee sign. TI features several restaurants, bars and
lounges, including the recently opened Mist. The showroom at TI
features

Mystère

, a unique choreographic mix of magic, special effects
and feats of human prowess produced and performed by Cirque du Soleil.
The Sirens of TI Show is performed at the front of the resort,
providing a significant presence to visitors on the Las Vegas Strip
and beckoning visitors into TI. In recognition of its superior
customer service and facilities, TI has been awarded the Four Diamond
rating by AAA. We are planning to remodel the buffet at TI and open
several new restaurants and a nightclub in 2004.

New York-New York Hotel and Casino

New York-New York is a themed destination resort on the Las Vegas
Strip at Tropicana Avenue, covering approximately 20 acres. The
architecture at New York-New York replicates many of New York City’s
landmark buildings and icons, including the Statue of Liberty, the
Empire State Building, Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge and a Coney
Island-style roller coaster. The casino features highly themed
interiors including

Park Avenue

with retail shops, a

Central Park

setting in the central casino area, and

Little Italy

with its
traditional food court set inside a typical residential neighborhood.
New York-New York also features several specialty leased restaurants,
numerous bars and lounges, including nationally-recognized Coyote Ugly
and ESPNZone and the recently opened Irish pub, Nine Fine Irishmen.
Entertainment includes

Zumanity

by Cirque du Soleil, which opened in
August 2003, and Rita Rudner.

Monte Carlo Resort & Casino

Monte Carlo is located on approximately 46 acres with 600 feet of
frontage on the Las Vegas Strip, approximately one-half mile south of
Bellagio. We own 50% of this resort in a joint venture with Mandalay
Resort Group, which manages the resort. Monte Carlo has a palatial
style reminiscent of the Belle Époque, the French Victorian
architecture of the late 19th century. The resort has amenities such
as fine dining at Andre’s, a brew pub featuring live entertainment, a
health spa, a beauty salon, a 1,200-seat theatre featuring the
world-renowned magician Lance Burton, a large pool area and lighted
tennis courts.

Boardwalk Hotel and Casino

The Boardwalk is located between Bellagio and Monte Carlo on the
Las Vegas Strip. This facility includes 654 hotel rooms and 32,000
square feet of casino space. Other amenities at the Boardwalk include
a coffee shop, a buffet, an entertainment lounge, a gift shop,
interior meeting space and two outdoor swimming pools.

Other Nevada Resorts

Primm Valley Resorts

Primm Valley Resorts consists of three hotel-casinos and three
gas stations on both sides of Interstate 15 at the California/Nevada
state line in Primm, Nevada (about 40 miles south of Las Vegas) and
the Primm Valley Golf Club nearby in California. Buffalo Bill’s
Resort & Casino, Primm Valley Resort & Casino, Whiskey Pete’s Hotel &
Casino, Primm Valley Golf Club and three gas stations including the
Primm Center (collectively, the “Primm Valley Resorts”) form a major
destination location and offer visitors driving from California the
first opportunity to wager upon entering Nevada and the last
opportunity before leaving.

Primm Valley Resorts offer an array of amenities and attractions,
including a 25,000-square foot conference center, numerous owned and
leased restaurants, and a variety of amusement rides. The 6,100-seat
Star of the Desert Arena hosts top-name entertainers. Connected to
Primm Valley Resorts is the Fashion Outlet of Las Vegas, a shopping
mall containing approximately 400,000 square feet of retail space with
over 100 retail outlet stores. The Fashion Outlet is owned and
operated by a third party.



Golf Resorts

We own and operate an exclusive world-class golf course, Shadow
Creek, located approximately ten miles north of our Las Vegas Strip
resorts. Shadow Creek is ranked 7

th

in Golf Digest’s ranking of
America’s 100 Greatest Public Courses. We also own and operate the
Primm Valley Golf Club, located four miles south of Primm in
California, which includes two 18-hole championship courses. All of
these golf courses were designed by renowned golf course architect Tom
Fazio.

Other Resorts

MGM Grand Detroit

MGM Grand Detroit is our interim casino facility in Detroit,
Michigan. The facility’s interior is decorated in an Art Deco motif
with themed bars, a VIP lounge and several restaurants, including our
signature upscale restaurant, the Hollywood Brown Derby. The site is
conveniently located off the Howard Street exit from the John C. Lodge
Expressway in downtown Detroit, and has parking for over 3,000
vehicles in two parking garages and additional on-site covered
parking.

Beau Rivage

Beau Rivage is a luxurious beachfront resort located on a 41-acre
site with 1,400 feet of frontage where Interstate 110 meets the Gulf
Coast in Biloxi, Mississippi. The graceful driveway leading to Beau
Rivage is lined with intricate gardens and stately oak trees and large
trees fill the resort’s skylit atrium lobby. Distinctive restaurants
offer a variety of dining experiences, including a café nestled in the
atrium gardens, Port House, a steak and seafood restaurant surrounded
by tropical fish and coral reefs, and Anna Mae, featuring creative and
contemporary Asian cuisine. Adjoining its lavish health spa and salon
is a lushly landscaped swimming pool and café overlooking the Gulf of
Mexico. Beau Rivage also offers a state-of-the-art convention center,
a shopping esplanade, a 1,600-seat theatre and a brew pub with live
entertainment. Beau Rivage is rated as a Four Diamond resort by AAA.

Borgata

The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa is located on 29 acres at
Renaissance Pointe in Atlantic City, New Jersey and opened July 3,
2003. In addition to its 2,000 guest rooms and suites and extensive
gaming floor, Borgata includes several specialty restaurants, retail
shops, a European-style health spa, meeting space and unique
entertainment venues. Borgata is the first new casino in Atlantic
City in over 13 years. We own 50% of the limited liability company
that owns Borgata, through our contribution of the underlying land and
$133 million of cash to the venture. Boyd Gaming Corporation owns 50%
of Borgata through cash contributions of $223 million and also
operates the resort. Borgata obtained a $630 million secured bank
credit facility, which is non-recourse to MGM MIRAGE, to fund the
project costs. Borgata was completed at a cost of approximately $1.1
billion.

MGM Grand Australia

MGM Grand Australia is located on 18 acres of beachfront property
in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia. The resort includes a
public and private casino, hotel, restaurants and other facilities.
We have positioned MGM Grand Australia as a multi-faceted gaming and
entertainment facility for the local market and, to a lesser extent,
as an exclusive destination resort for international table game
customers.

In February 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell our
subsidiaries that own and operate MGM Grand Australia for A$195
(approximately $150 million), subject to certain working capital
adjustments. We expect this transaction to be completed by the third
quarter of 2004, subject to customary sales conditions and regulatory
approvals.

Future Development

Detroit, Michigan

The Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act provides that not
more than three casinos may be licensed at any one time by the State
of Michigan and that they be located only in the City of Detroit. In
November 1997, MGM Grand Detroit, LLC was selected to develop one of
the three authorized hotel-casino complexes. MGM Grand Detroit, Inc.,
our wholly owned subsidiary, holds a controlling interest in MGM Grand
Detroit, LLC. A minority interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is held
by Partners Detroit, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company owned
by residents and entities located in the Detroit metropolitan area.



MGM Grand Detroit, LLC has operated an interim casino facility in
downtown Detroit since July 1999. In August 2002 the Detroit City
Council approved revised development agreements with us and two other
developers. The revised development agreement released us and the
City from certain of the obligations under the original agreement and
significantly changed other provisions of the original agreement.

We are currently in the process of obtaining land and developing
plans for the permanent facility, and currently expect the project to
cost approximately $575 million (including land, capitalized interest
and preopening expenses, but excluding approximately $115 million of
payments to the City under the revised development agreement). The
design, budget and schedule of the permanent facility are not
finalized, and the ultimate timing, cost and scope of the facility are
subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects.

The ability to construct the permanent casino facility is
currently subject to resolution of the Lac Vieux litigation – see
“Item 3. Legal Proceedings”. Pending the resolution of this
litigation, the 6

th

Circuit Court of Appeals has issued an injunction,
pending appeal, prohibiting the City and the developers from
commencing construction pending further action of the 6

th

Circuit
Court. Therefore, we do not know when we will be able to commence
construction of, or complete, the permanent facility.

Atlantic City, New Jersey

We own approximately 149 acres on Renaissance Pointe in Atlantic
City, New Jersey. We obtained the land at Renaissance Pointe through
an agreement between Mirage and the City of Atlantic City. In
addition, Borgata occupies 29 acres at Renaissance Pointe, including
27 acres it owns and two acres we lease to Borgata. Of the remaining
land, approximately 95 acres are suitable for development, and a
portion of these acres consists of common roads, landscaping and
master plan improvements which we designed and developed as required
by our agreement with Boyd.

On October 16, 2002, we announced the temporary suspension of our
development activities on our wholly-owned project on the Renaissance
Pointe land in Atlantic City. We must apply for and receive numerous
governmental permits and satisfy other conditions before construction
of a new resort on the Renaissance Pointe site could begin. No
assurance can be given that we will develop a casino resort in New
Jersey, or its ultimate schedule, size, configuration or cost if we do
develop a casino resort.

Las Vegas, Nevada

We own an approximately 50-acre site for future development with
over 1,200 feet of frontage on the Las Vegas Strip between Bellagio
and Monte Carlo, a part of which is occupied by the Boardwalk. The
design, timing and cost of any future development on the site will
depend on several factors, including the market’s ability to absorb
new hotel-casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, competition from
gaming outside of Nevada and the ultimate size and scope of the
project, among other factors.

In 2002, we entered into an agreement with Turnberry Associates
to develop luxury condominium towers at MGM Grand Las Vegas. We will
initially contribute land and up to $3 million to the project for a
50% investment. Turnberry Associates will contribute $9 million, and
up to an additional $3 million, in cash and will manage the
development and sales process. The venture will obtain construction
financing for the remainder of the expected $175 million to $200
million cost of the first tower once sufficient pre-sales have
occurred to obtain financing. We will have the opportunity to rent
the condominiums to third parties on behalf of owners who elect to
have us do so. Depending on market acceptance of the initial tower,
we and Turnberry Associates may develop, on similar terms, up to an
additional five condominium towers.

United Kingdom

In anticipation of reforms to gambling legislation currently
being considered by the British government, we have entered into
several strategic agreements in the United Kingdom. In May 2003, we
purchased a 25% interest in Metro Casinos Limited, which is developing
a new casino in Bristol. Metro Casinos Limited is a subsidiary of R J
Bown (Holdings) Ltd, the owner of the Westcliff Casino, one of the
largest United Kingdom provincial casinos. The Bristol facility is
expected to open by March 2004. We received regulatory approval for
our investment from the Gaming Board for Great Britain in November
2003.

In October 2003, we entered into an agreement with Earls Court
and Olympia Group, which operates large exhibition and trade show
facilities in London, to form a jointly owned company. The entity
would develop a large entertainment and gaming facility, which we
would operate in space leased from Earls Court and Olympia, to
complement the existing Olympia facilities. The agreement is subject
to implementation of proposed gaming law reforms and a tax structure
acceptable to us, and obtaining required planning and other approvals.
We would own 82.5% of the entity.



In November 2003, we entered into an agreement with Newcastle
United PLC to create a 50-50 joint venture which would build a major
new mixed-use development, including casino development, on a site in
Newcastle’s city centre adjacent to Newcastle United’s football
stadium. Newcastle United is one of the leading English Premier
League (Soccer) clubs. Construction of the complex is contingent upon
implementation of proposed gaming law reforms and a tax structure
acceptable to us, and obtaining required planning and other approvals.
Newcastle United PLC will contribute the land to the joint venture,
and we will make an equity investment and develop and operate the
complex, as well as own the casino development in leased premises
within the complex.

In February 2004, we announced an agreement in principle with The
British Land Company PLC whereby we would operate a casino in leased
premises within a newly developed leisure and entertainment complex
adjacent to the Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield UK. The
agreement is subject to implementation of proposed gaming law reforms
and a tax structure acceptable to us, and obtaining required planning
and other approvals.

Wembley plc

In January 2004, we reached an agreement with Wembley plc
(“Wembley”) on the terms of a cash acquisition by us of Wembley. We
have offered Wembley’s shareholders 750 pence per share, valuing
Wembley at $490 million as of the date of the offer. Wembley has no
material indebtedness. Wembley’s operations consist of greyhound
racing and video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) at its Lincoln Park
facility in Rhode Island, three greyhound tracks and one horse racing
track in Colorado, and six greyhound tracks in the United Kingdom. A
member of the Wembly plc group, Lincoln Park, Inc., and two executives
of the Wembly plc group are subject to indictment in Rhode Island. We
will purchase Wembley free and clear of the indictment and any related
liabilities. Under an agreement with the United States Department of
Justice, the indictment will proceed against a new entity funded by
Wembley which we will not be acquiring. We expect the transaction to
close by the third quarter of 2004, subject to requisite court and
shareholder approval, the completion of the Lincoln Park
reorganization and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.

New York Racing Association

We have an understanding with the New York Racing Association
(“NYRA”) to manage VLTs at NYRA’s Aqueduct horseracing facility in
metropolitan New York. We would assist in the development of the
facility, including providing project financing, and would manage the
facility for a fee. The project is anticipated to cost $135 million.
Work was halted on the VLT facility in August 2003 pending the outcome
of an investigation of certain aspects of NYRA’s operations by Federal
prosecutors. In December 2003, NYRA reached agreement with the
Justice Department whereby NYRA was indicted with prosecution
deferred. NYRA agreed to pay a fine and the indictment will be
dismissed with prejudice upon NYRA implementing certain reforms and
otherwise complying with the terms of the agreement. Our
participation is subject to a definitive agreement, regulatory
approvals and certain legislative changes by the State of New York.

Other

We regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition
opportunities in both the domestic and international markets. These
opportunities may include the ownership, management and operation of
gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada or in states other
than Nevada or outside of the United States. We may undertake these
opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third
parties. Development and operation of any gaming facility in a new
jurisdiction is subject to many contingencies. Several of these
contingencies are outside of our control and may include the passage
of appropriate gaming legislation, the issuance of necessary permits,
licenses and approvals, the availability of appropriate financing and
the satisfaction of other conditions. We cannot be sure that we will
decide or be able to proceed with any acquisition or expansion
opportunities.

Marketing

All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours each day, every day of
the year. We do not consider our business to be particularly
seasonal. We believe that the largest portion of our Nevada customers
live in Southern California, although other geographic areas are also
important.

The level of gaming activity at our casinos is the single largest
factor in determining our revenues and operating income. We generate
slightly over half of our net revenues from gaming activities. We
also receive a large amount of revenues from room, food and beverage,
entertainment and retail operations. Since we believe that the number
of walk-in customers also affects the success of all of our
hotel-casinos, we design our facilities to maximize their attraction
to guests of other hotels.



The principal segments of the Nevada and Mississippi gaming
markets are leisure travel, premium gaming customers, conventions,
including small meetings and corporate incentive programs, and tour
and travel. Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage appeal to
the upper end of each market segment, balancing their business by
using the convention and tour and travel segments to fill the mid-week
and off-peak periods. Our marketing strategy for TI and New York-New
York is aimed at attracting middle- to upper-middle-income wagerers,
largely from the leisure travel and, to a lesser extent, the tour and
travel segments. Boardwalk and Primm Valley Resorts appeal primarily
to middle-income customers attracted by room, food and beverage and
entertainment prices that are lower than those offered by the major
Las Vegas hotel-casinos.

We utilize our world-class golf courses in marketing programs at
our Las Vegas Strip and other Nevada resorts. Our major Las Vegas
hotel-casinos offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges
at Shadow Creek. In connection with our marketing activities, we also
invite our premium casino customers to play Shadow Creek on a
complimentary basis. We use Primm Valley Golf Club for marketing
purposes at our Las Vegas and Primm resorts, including offering room
and golf packages at special rates.

We believe Beau Rivage is the most luxurious hotel-casino on the
Mississippi Gulf Coast. Beau Rivage seeks to attract the most
affluent customers in each market segment, particularly those who live
in major cities in the South, as well as customers residing in the
Gulf Coast region. MGM Grand Detroit markets primarily to customers
within a 150-mile radius of Detroit. Its customers are attracted by
its diverse gaming and dining offerings, its convenient location and
its ample onsite parking facilities. MGM Grand Australia has targeted
its local Northern Territory market for its primary customer base.

We advertise on radio, television and billboards and in
newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United
States, as well as on the Internet and by direct mail. We also
advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major
United States and foreign cities. A key element of marketing to
high-level wagerers is personal contact by our marketing personnel.
Direct marketing is also important in the convention segment. We
maintain internet websites which inform customers about our resorts
and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms and make restaurant and
show reservations.

We utilize technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in
gaming as well. Our Players Club links seven of our United States
resorts, and consolidates all slots and table games activity for
customers with a Players Club account. Customers qualify for benefits
at all of these resorts, regardless of where they play. We believe
that our Players Club enables us to more effectively market to our
customers. Almost all of the slot machines at our United States
resorts operate with International Game Technology’s EZ-Pay™ cashless
gaming system. We believe that this system enhances the customer
experience and increases the revenue potential of our slot machines.

Issuance of Markers

Marker play represents a large portion of the table games volume
at Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage. Our other facilities
do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer
markers to customers at those casinos as well, with the exception of
MGM Grand Australia, where Northern Territory legislation prohibits
marker play.

We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and
aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay
their marker balances timely. These collection efforts are similar to
those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue
customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency
notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and
civil litigation. In Nevada, Mississippi and Michigan, amounts owed
for markers which are not timely paid are enforceable under state
laws. All other states are required to enforce a judgment for amounts
owed for markers which are not timely paid, entered into in Nevada,
Mississippi or Michigan, pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause
of the United States Constitution. Amounts owed for markers which are
not timely paid are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries,
but the United States assets of foreign customers may be reached to
satisfy judgments entered in the United States. A significant portion
of our Company’s accounts receivable, for amounts unpaid resulting
from markers which are not collectible through banking channels, is
owed by major casino customers from the Far East. The collectibility
of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors, including
changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the
customers’ home countries.



Supervision of Gaming Activities

In connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our
casinos, we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all
receipts and disbursements. These audit and cash controls include:

Competition

Las Vegas

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete with a large number of other
hotel-casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel-casinos on
or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel-casinos in the downtown area,
which is about five miles from the center of the Strip, and several
major facilities elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. According to the
Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, there were approximately
130,000 guestrooms in Las Vegas at December 31, 2003, up from
approximately 127,000 rooms at December 31, 2002. Las Vegas visitor
volume was 35.5 million in 2003, a slight increase from the 35.1
million reported for 2002. Additional new hotel-casinos and expansion
projects at existing Las Vegas hotel-casinos are under construction or
have been proposed. In addition, further expansion of Native American
gaming in California is likely. We are unable to determine to what
extent increased competition will affect our future operating results.

Primm, Nevada

The Primm Valley Resorts compete primarily with two hotel-casinos
located 11 miles north along Interstate 15 in Jean, Nevada and with
the numerous other hotels and casinos in the Las Vegas area, as well
as Native American gaming facilities in Southern California. Since
many of our current customers stop at Primm as they are driving on
Interstate 15 to and from major casino-hotels located in Las Vegas, we
believe that our success at Primm is also favorably influenced by the
popularity of the Las Vegas resorts. The expansion of Native American
gaming has already had an impact on our Primm Valley Resorts, and the
substantial expansion of Native American gaming facilities in
California, which is currently anticipated, could have a further
adverse effect on the Primm Valley Resorts.

Detroit

MGM Grand Detroit competes in this market with two other interim
casinos located in Detroit, as well as a government-owned casino
located nearby in Windsor, Ontario. There are Native American casinos
in Michigan, but none are near the Detroit metropolitan area.

Biloxi, Mississippi

Beau Rivage competes with 11 other casinos in the Mississippi
Gulf Coast market, nine of which offer hotel accommodations. Gulf
Coast casinos also compete in the regional market with a land-based
casino in New Orleans and a land-based Native American hotel-casino in
central Mississippi. Casinos in the Gulf Coast market also compete
for the south Florida market with casinos in the Bahamas. Gulf Coast
casinos compete to a lesser extent with a number of casinos in
Mississippi and Louisiana.

Australia

The success of MGM Grand Australia depends in part upon a balance
of (i) its ability to effectively serve the local community as well as
(ii) its ability to make efficient use of its strategic proximity to
the Southeast Asian gaming market. The Darwin International Airport
is an average of 5.5 hours away from the major Asian cities. However,
frequency of scheduled air service is a limiting factor.



There are 13 casinos in Australia competing for the Far East
market. Australian casinos operate under exclusive arrangements,
which create a regional monopoly for a fixed term. As such,
Australian casinos do not compete among themselves for the regional
middle to low-end players. However, Far East premium players have
become an increasingly important source of revenues; consequently,
this market has become very competitive. Due to the competition for
premium play customers, and the limitations on scheduled air service,
MGM Grand Australia has targeted the local market for its customer
base, which has produced relatively stable results.

Other

Our Company’s facilities also compete for gaming customers with
hotel-casino operations located in other areas of the United States
and other parts of the world, and for vacationers with non-gaming
tourist destinations such as Hawaii and Florida. Our hotel-casinos
compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track
wagering, card parlors, and other forms of legalized gaming in the
United States. In recent years, certain states have legalized, and
several other states have considered legalizing, casino gaming. We do
not believe that legalization or expansion of casino gaming in those
jurisdictions would have a material adverse impact on our operations.
However, we do believe that the legalization of large-scale land-based
casino gaming in or near certain major metropolitan areas,
particularly in California, could have a material adverse effect on
the Las Vegas market.

How We Compete

Our major casino resorts compete on the basis of:

The principal negative factors relating to our competitive position are:

•

Our limited geographic diversification (our major
resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip and some of
our largest competitors operate in more gaming markets than
we do);

•

There are a number of gaming facilities located
closer to where our customers live than our resorts;

•

Our guestroom, dining and entertainment prices are
often higher than those of most of our competitors in each
market, although we believe that the quality of our
facilities and services is also higher; and

•

Our hotel-casinos compete to some extent with each
other for customers. Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and The
Mirage, in particular, compete for some of the same high-end
customers.

Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately 36,000 full-time
and 7,000 part-time employees, of which approximately 3,100 full-time
employees and 300 part-time employees worked at the Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries. At that date, we had collective bargaining contracts
with unions covering approximately 17,000 of our employees, of which
approximately 1,400 employees worked at the Golden Nugget Las Vegas.
We do not have union contracts at Beau Rivage or the Boardwalk. We
consider our employee relations to be good.



Regulation and Licensing

Nevada Government Regulation

The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in Clark
County, Nevada are subject to: (i) the Nevada Gaming Control Act and
the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the “Nevada
Act”); and (ii) various local regulations. The Company’s gaming
operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the
Nevada Gaming Commission (the “Nevada Commission”), the Nevada State
Gaming Control Board (the “Nevada Board”) and the Clark County Liquor
and Gaming Licensing Board (the “CCLGLB”). The Nevada Commission, the
Nevada Board, and the CCLGLB are collectively referred to as the
“Nevada Gaming Authorities.”

The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada
Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that
are concerned with, among other things: (i) the prevention of unsavory
or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement
with gaming at any time or in any capacity; (ii) the establishment and
maintenance of responsible accounting practices of licensees,
including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal
affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues; (iii) providing
reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports
with the Nevada Gaming Authorities; (iv) the prevention of cheating
and fraudulent practices; and (v) providing a source of state and
local revenues through taxation and licensing fees. Any change in
such laws, regulations and procedures could have an adverse effect on
the Company’s gaming operations.

MGM Grand Hotel, LLC, dba MGM Grand Las Vegas, New York-New York
Hotel & Casino, LLC, dba New York-New York Hotel & Casino, The
Primadonna Company, LLC, dba Primm Valley Resort, Buffalo Bill’s and
Whiskey Pete’s, THE MIRAGE CASINO-HOTEL, dba The Mirage, Bellagio,
LLC, dba Bellagio, Treasure Island Corp., dba Treasure Island at The
Mirage, Boardwalk Casino, Inc., dba Boardwalk Hotel and Casino, and
Victoria Partners, dba Monte Carlo Resort & Casino (collectively
referred to as the “Casino Licensees”), operate casinos and are
required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Each gaming
license requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not
transferable. MGM Grand Las Vegas, New York-New York, The Primadonna
Company, LLC and MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp. are also licensed as
manufacturers and distributors of gaming devices and the Boardwalk is
licensed as a distributor of gaming devices. MGM Grand Las Vegas is
also licensed to operate an International Gaming Salon. The Company
and certain of its subsidiaries are also licensed as shareholders,
members and/or managers of certain corporate and limited liability
company Casino Licensees. The Company’s subsidiary MRGS Corp. is
licensed as a 50% general partner of Victoria Partners, the joint
venture with Mandalay Resort Group that owns and operates Monte
Carlo.

The Company and Mirage are also each required to be registered by
the Nevada Commission as a publicly traded corporation (“Registered
Corporation”) and as such, each is required periodically to submit
detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission and
furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may require.
No person may become a stockholder or member of, or receive any
percentage of profits from, the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE
Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., without first obtaining licenses
and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Company, Mirage
and the foregoing subsidiaries have obtained from the Nevada Gaming
Authorities the various registrations, approvals, permits and licenses
required in order to engage in gaming activities in Nevada.

The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who
has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, the
Company, Mirage, the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp.
or MRGS Corp., to determine whether such individual is suitable or
should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee.
Officers, directors and certain key employees of the foregoing
subsidiaries must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities
and may be required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities.
Certain officers, directors and key employees of the Company and
Mirage who are actively and directly involved in the gaming activities
of the foregoing subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found
suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming
Authorities may deny an application for licensing or a finding of
suitability for any cause they deem reasonable. A finding of
suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of
detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough
investigation. The applicant for licensing or a finding of
suitability, or the gaming licensee by which the applicant is employed
or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costs of the
investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the
Nevada Gaming Authorities, and in addition to their authority to deny
an application for a finding of suitability or licensure, the Nevada
Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a
corporate position.



If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer,
director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue
having a relationship with the Company, Mirage, the Casino Licensees,
MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., such company or
companies would have to sever all relationships with such person. In
addition, the Nevada Commission may require the Company, Mirage or the
foregoing subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any person who
refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of
suitability or of questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to
judicial review in Nevada.

The Company, Mirage, the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE
Manufacturing Corp., and MRGS Corp. are required to submit detailed
financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission.
Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and
similar financing transactions by the Company, Mirage and the
foregoing subsidiaries must be reported to or approved by the Nevada
Commission.

If it were determined that the Nevada Act was violated by the
Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., the
gaming licenses they hold could be limited, conditioned, suspended or
revoked, subject to compliance with certain statutory and regulatory
procedures. In addition, the Company, Mirage, the foregoing
subsidiaries and the persons involved could be subject to substantial
fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at the discretion
of the Nevada Commission. Further, a supervisor could be appointed by
the Nevada Commission to operate the Company’s gaming properties and,
under certain circumstances, earnings generated during the
supervisor’s appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of
the Company’s gaming properties) could be forfeited to the State of
Nevada. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any gaming license
or the appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of any gaming
license would) materially adversely affect the Company’s gaming
operations.

Any beneficial holder of the Company’s voting securities,
regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an
application, be investigated, and have his or her suitability as a
beneficial holder of the Company’s voting securities determined if the
Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would
otherwise be inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of
Nevada. The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by
the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any such investigation.

The Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of
any class of the Company’s voting securities to report the acquisition
to the Nevada Commission. The Nevada Act requires that beneficial
owners of more than 10% of any class of the Company’s voting
securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitability
within thirty days after the Chairman of the Nevada Board mails the
written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an
“institutional investor” as defined in the Nevada Act, which acquires
more than 10% but not more than 15% of any class of the Company’s
voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of
such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the
voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional
investor shall not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment
purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in
the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not
for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a
majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company, any
change in the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or
operations of the Company or any of its gaming affiliates, or any
other action that the Nevada Commission finds to be inconsistent with
holding the Company’s voting securities for investment purposes only.
Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting
securities for investment purposes only include: (i) voting on all
matters voted on by stockholders; (ii) making financial and other
inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities
analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in its
management, policies or operations; and (iii) such other activities as
the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such
investment intent. If the beneficial holder of voting securities who
must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must
submit detailed business and financial information including a list of
beneficial owners. The applicant is required to pay all costs of
investigation.



Under the Nevada Act and under certain circumstances, an
“institutional investor,” as defined in the Nevada Act, which intends
to acquire not more than 15% of any class of nonvoting securities of
a privately held corporation, limited partnership or limited liability
company that is also a registered holding or intermediary company or
the holder of a gaming license, may apply to the Nevada Commission for
a waiver of the usual prior licensing or finding of suitability
requirement if such institutional investor holds such nonvoting
securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor
shall not be deemed to hold nonvoting securities for investment
purposes unless the nonvoting securities were acquired and are held in
the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor, do not
give the institutional investor management authority, and do not,
directly or indirectly, allow the institutional investor to vote for
the election or appointment of members of the board of directors, a
general partner or manager, cause any change in the articles of
organization, operating agreement, other organic document, management,
policies or operations, or cause any other action that the Nevada
Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding nonvoting securities
for investment purposes only. Activities not deemed to be
inconsistent with holding nonvoting securities for investment purposes
only include: (i) nominating any candidate for election or appointment
to the entity’s board of directors or equivalent in connection with a
debt restructuring; (ii) making financial and other inquiries of
management of the type normally made by securities analysts for
informational purposes and not to cause a change in the entity’s
management, policies or operations; and (iii) such other activities as
the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such
investment intent. If the beneficial holder of nonvoting securities
who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it
must submit detailed business and financial information including a
list of beneficial owners. The applicant is required to pay all costs
of investigation.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of
suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so
by the Nevada Commission or the Chairman of the Nevada Board may be
found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if
the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial
owner. Any stockholder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or
indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the common stock of a
Registered Corporation beyond such period of time as may be prescribed
by the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. The
Company is subject to disciplinary action if, after it receives notice
that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other
relationship with the Company, Mirage, the Casino Licensees, MGM
MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., the Company, Mirage or the
foregoing subsidiaries (i) pays that person any dividend or interest
upon voting securities of the Company, (ii) allows that person to
exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through
securities held by that person, (iii) pays remuneration in any form to
that person for services rendered or otherwise, or (iv) fails to
pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to
relinquish his or her voting securities for cash at fair market value.
Additionally, the CCLGLB has taken the position that it has the
authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of
any corporation controlling a gaming licensee.

The Nevada Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder
of any debt security of a Registered Corporation to file an
application, be investigated and be found suitable to own the debt
security of a Registered Corporation. If the Nevada Commission
determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then
pursuant to the Nevada Act, the Registered Corporation can be
sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if without the prior
approval of the Nevada Commission, it: (i) pays to the unsuitable
person any dividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever; (ii)
recognizes any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection
with such securities; (iii) pays the unsuitable person remuneration in
any form; or (iv) makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of
principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar
transaction.

The Company is required to maintain a current stock ledger in
Nevada that may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any
time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a
nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of
the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to
make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder
unsuitable. The Company is also required to render maximum assistance
in determining the identity of the beneficial owner. The Nevada
Commission has the power to require the Company’s and Mirage’s stock
certificates to bear a legend indicating that such securities are
subject to the Nevada Act. However, to date, the Nevada Commission
has not imposed such a requirement on either the Company or Mirage.



Neither the Company nor Mirage may make a public offering of any
securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the
securities or the proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to
construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to
retire or extend obligations incurred for such purposes. Such
approval, if given, does not constitute a finding, recommendation or
approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada Board as to the
accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investment merits of the
securities. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

Under the Nevada Act, none of the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE
Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., may guarantee a security issued by
the Company or Mirage pursuant to a public offering, or pledge their
assets to secure the payment or performance of the obligations
evidenced by such a security issued by the Company or Mirage, without
the prior approval of the Nevada Commission. Similarly, neither the
common stock nor other ownership interests of the Casino Licensees,
MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., may be pledged, nor may
the pledge of such common stock or other ownership interests foreclose
on such a pledge, without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission.
Restrictions on the transfer of any equity security issued by the
Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., and
agreements not to encumber such securities, are ineffective without
the prior approval of the Nevada Commission.

On January 22, 2004, the Nevada Commission granted the Company
and Mirage prior approval to make public offerings for a period of 18
months, subject to certain conditions (the “Shelf Approval”). The
Shelf Approval also includes approval for the Company and Mirage to
place restrictions on the transfer of any equity security issued to
the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp.,
and to enter into agreements not to encumber such securities, pursuant
to any public offering made under the Shelf Approval. However, the
Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice
upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of
the Nevada Board. The Shelf Approval does not constitute a finding,
recommendation or approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada
Board as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the
investment merits of the securities offered. Any representation to
the contrary is unlawful.

Changes in control of the Company or Mirage through merger,
consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting
agreements, or any act or conduct by a person whereby he or she
obtains control, may not occur without the prior approval of the
Nevada Commission. Entities seeking to acquire control of a
Registered Corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada
Commission concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to
assuming control of such Registered Corporation. The Nevada
Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers,
directors and other persons having a material relationship or
involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control to be
investigated and licensed as part of the approval process of the
transaction.

The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate
acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities
and corporate defensive tactics affecting Nevada gaming licensees, and
Registered Corporations that are affiliated with those operations, may
be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada
Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the
potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada’s
gaming industry and to further Nevada’s policy to: (i) assure the
financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their
affiliates; (ii) preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting
business in the corporate form; and (iii) promote a neutral
environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.
Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada
Commission before the Company can make exceptional repurchases of
voting securities above the current market price thereof and before a
corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated.

The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of
recapitalization proposed by a Registered Corporation’s board of
directors in response to a tender offer made directly to the
Registered Corporation’s stockholders for the purpose of acquiring
control of the Registered Corporation.



License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the
type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of
Nevada and to Clark County. Depending upon the particular fee or tax
involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly
or annually and are based upon either: (i) a percentage of the gross
revenues received; (ii) the number of gaming devices operated; or
(iii) the number of table games operated. The tax on gross revenues
received is generally 6.75%. An excise tax is also paid by the Casino
Licensees on charges for admission to any facility where certain forms
of live entertainment are provided. Nevada licensees that hold a
license as a manufacturer or a distributor, such as MGM Grand Las
Vegas, New York-New York, The Primadonna Company, LLC, the Boardwalk
and MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., also pay certain fees and taxes to
the State of Nevada.

Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered,
required to be registered, or is under common control with such
persons (collectively, “Licensees”), and who proposes to become
involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit
with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in
the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the
Nevada Board of their participation in such foreign gaming. The
revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of
the Nevada Commission. Thereafter, Licensees are also required to
comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act.
Licensees are also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada
Commission if they knowingly violate any laws of the foreign
jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation, fail to
conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards
of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations, engage
in any activity or enter into any association that is unsuitable
because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in
Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect discredit or disrepute upon the
State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming
policies of Nevada, engage in any activity or enter into any
association that interferes with the ability of the State of Nevada to
collect gaming taxes and fees, or employ, contract with or associate
with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a
license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of
personal unsuitability, or who has been found guilty of cheating at
gambling.

The sale of alcoholic beverages by the Casino Licensees is
subject to licensing, control and regulation by the applicable local
authorities. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable.
The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or
revoke any such license, and any such disciplinary action could (and
revocation would) have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s
operations.

Pursuant to a 1985 agreement with the United States Department of
the Treasury (the “Treasury”) and provisions of the Money Laundering
Suppression Act of 1994, the Nevada Commission and the Nevada Board
have authority, under Regulation 6A of the Nevada Act, to enforce
their own cash transaction reporting laws applicable to casinos which
substantially parallel the federal Bank Secrecy Act. The Nevada Act
requires gaming licensees to monitor receipts and disbursements of
currency related to cash purchases of chips, cash wagers, cash
deposits or cash payment of gaming debts in excess of $10,000 in a
24-hour period, and file reports of such transactions with the United
States Internal Revenue Service. Casinos are required to file
suspicious activity reports with the Treasury and provide copies
thereof to the Nevada Board. Nevada casinos are required to meet the
reporting and record keeping requirements of Treasury regulations
recently amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.

Michigan Government Regulation and Taxation

The Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act subjects the
ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities to extensive state
licensing and regulatory requirements. The Michigan Act also
authorizes local regulation of casino gaming facilities by the City of
Detroit, provided that any such local ordinances regulating casino
gaming are consistent with the Michigan Act and rules promulgated to
implement it.

The Michigan Act creates the Michigan Gaming Control Board and
authorizes it to grant casino licenses to not more than three
applicants who have entered into development agreements with the City
of Detroit. The Michigan Board is granted extensive authority to
conduct background investigations and determine the suitability of
casino license applicants, affiliated companies, officers, directors,
or managerial employees of applicants and affiliated companies and
persons or entities holding a one percent or greater direct or
indirect interest in an applicant or affiliated company. Institutional
investors holding less than certain specified amounts of debt or
equity securities are exempted from meeting the suitability
requirements of the Michigan Act, provided such securities are issued
by a publicly traded corporation, such as MGM MIRAGE, and the
securities were purchased for investment purposes only and not for the
purpose of influencing or affecting the affairs of the issuer. Any
person who supplies goods or services to a casino licensee which are
directly related to, used in connection with, or affecting gaming, and
any person who supplies other goods or services to a casino licensee



on a regular and continuing basis, must obtain a supplier’s license
from the Michigan Board. In addition, any individual employed by a
casino licensee or by a supplier licensee whose work duties are
related to or involved in the gambling operation or are performed in a
restricted area or a gaming area of a casino must obtain an
occupational license from the Michigan Board.

The Michigan Act imposes the burden of proof on the applicant for
a casino license to establish its suitability to receive and hold the
license. The applicant must establish its suitability as to
integrity, moral character and reputation, business probity, financial
ability and experience, responsibility, and other criteria deemed
appropriate by the Michigan Board. A casino license is valid for a
period of one year and the Michigan Board may refuse to renew it upon
a determination that the licensee no longer meets the requirements for
licensure.

The Michigan Board may, among other things, revoke, suspend or
restrict a casino license. Substantial fines or forfeiture of assets
for violations of gaming or liquor control laws or rules may also be
levied against a casino licensee. In the event that a casino license
is revoked or suspended for more than 120 days, the Michigan Act
provides for the appointment of a conservator who, among other things,
is required to sell or otherwise transfer the assets of the casino
licensee or former licensee to another person or entity who meets the
requirements of the Michigan Act for licensure, subject to certain
approvals and consultations.

The Michigan Board has adopted administrative rules, which became
effective on June 23, 1998, to implement the terms of the Michigan
Act. Among other things, the rules impose more detailed substantive
and procedural requirements with respect to casino licensing and
operations. Included are requirements regarding such things as
licensing investigations and hearings, record keeping and retention,
contracting, reports to the Michigan Board, internal control and
accounting procedures, security and surveillance, extensions of credit
to gaming patrons, conduct of gaming, and transfers of ownership
interests in licensed casinos. The rules also establish numerous
Michigan Board procedures regarding licensing, disciplinary and other
hearings, and similar matters. The rules have the force of law and
are binding on the Michigan Board as well as on applicants for or
holders of casino licenses.

The Michigan Liquor Control Commission licenses, controls and
regulates the sale of alcoholic beverages by the MGM Grand Detroit
casino pursuant to the Michigan Liquor Control Act. The Michigan Act
also requires that casinos sell and distribute alcoholic beverages in
a manner consistent with the Michigan Liquor Control Act.

The Detroit City Council enacted an ordinance entitled “Casino
Gaming Authorization and Casino Development Agreement Certification
and Compliance.” The ordinance authorizes casino gaming only by
operators who are licensed by the Michigan Board and are parties to a
development agreement which has been approved and certified by the
City Council and is currently in effect, or are acting on behalf of
such parties. The development agreement among the City of Detroit,
MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and the Economic Development Corporation of
Detroit has been so approved and certified and is currently in effect.
The ordinance requires each casino operator to submit to the Mayor of
Detroit and to the City Council periodic reports regarding the
operator’s compliance with its development agreement or, in the event
of non-compliance, reasons for non-compliance and an explanation of
efforts to comply. The ordinance requires the Mayor of Detroit to
monitor each casino operator’s compliance with its development
agreement, to take appropriate enforcement action in the event of
default and to notify the City Council of defaults and enforcement
action taken; and, if a development agreement is terminated, it
requires the City Council to transmit notice of such action to the
Michigan Board within five business days along with Detroit’s request
that the Michigan Board revoke the relevant operator’s certificate of
suitability or casino license. If a development agreement is
terminated, the Michigan Act requires the Michigan Board to revoke the
relevant operator’s casino license upon the request of Detroit.

The administrative rules of the Michigan Board prohibit a casino
licensee or a holding company or affiliate that has control of a
casino licensee in Michigan from entering into a debt transaction
affecting the capitalization or financial viability of its Michigan
casino operation without prior approval from the Michigan Board. On
October 14, 2003, the Michigan Board authorized MGM Grand Detroit, LLC
to borrow under the Company’s credit facilities for the purpose of
financing the development of its permanent casino and the future
expansion thereof, maintenance capital expenditures for its temporary
and permanent casinos and the cost of renovating the temporary casino
facility for adaptive re-use and/or sale following the completion of
the permanent casino, and to secure such borrowings with liens upon
substantially all of its assets. In the same order, the Michigan
Board authorized MGM Grand Detroit, Inc. to pledge its equity interest
in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC to secure such borrowings.



The Michigan Act effectively provides that each of the three
casinos in Detroit shall pay a wagering tax equal to 18% of its
adjusted gross receipts, to be paid 8.1% to Michigan and 9.9% to
Detroit, an annual municipal service fee equal to the greater of $4
million or 1.25% of its adjusted gross receipts to be paid to Detroit
to defray its cost of hosting casinos and an annual assessment, as
adjusted based upon a consumer price index, in the initial amount of
approximately $8.3 million to be paid by each casino to Michigan to
defray its regulatory enforcement and other casino-related costs.
These payments are in addition to the taxes, fees and assessments
customarily paid by business entities situated in Detroit.

Mississippi Government Regulation

We conduct our Mississippi gaming operations through an indirect
subsidiary, Beau Rivage Resorts, Inc., which owns and operates Beau
Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi. The ownership and operation of casino
facilities in Mississippi are subject to extensive state and local
regulation, but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the
Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi State Tax
Commission.

The Mississippi Gaming Control Act, which legalized dockside
casino gaming in Mississippi, was enacted on June 29, 1990. Although
not identical, the Mississippi Act is similar to the Nevada Gaming
Control Act. Effective October 29, 1991, the Mississippi Gaming
Commission adopted regulations in furtherance of the Mississippi Act
which are also similar in many respects to the Nevada gaming
regulations. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of
Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming Commission seek to:

The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by
the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Changes in Mississippi law or the
regulations or the Mississippi Gaming Commission’s interpretations
thereof may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming
that may be conducted, and could have a material adverse effect on us
and our Mississippi gaming operations.

The Mississippi Act provides for legalized dockside gaming at the
discretion of the 14 counties that either border the Gulf Coast or the
Mississippi River, but only if the voters in such counties have not
voted to prohibit gaming in that county. As of January 1, 2004,
dockside gaming was permissible in nine of the 14 eligible counties in
the state and gaming operations had commenced in Adams, Coahoma,
Hancock, Harrison, Tunica, Warren and Washington counties. Under
Mississippi law, gaming vessels must be located on the Mississippi
River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the
Mississippi River, or in the waters of the State of Mississippi lying
south of the state in eligible counties along the Mississippi Gulf
Coast. The law permits unlimited stakes gaming on permanently moored
vessels on a 24-hour basis and does not restrict the percentage of
space which may be utilized for gaming. There are no limitations on
the number of gaming licenses which may be issued in Mississippi.

Beau Rivage Resorts and Beau Rivage Distribution Corp. (“BRDC”),
a subsidiary of Beau Rivage Resorts, are subject to the licensing and
regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Beau Rivage
Resorts is licensed as a Mississippi gaming operator, and BRDC is
licensed as a Mississippi distributor of gaming devices. Gaming
licenses require the periodic payment of fees and taxes and are not
transferable. Gaming licenses are issued for a maximum term of three
years and must be renewed periodically thereafter. Beau Rivage
Resorts received its Mississippi gaming license on June 20, 1996 and a
renewal on June 21, 1998. BRDC received its Mississippi distributor’s
license on August 20, 1998. On May 18, 2000, the Mississippi Gaming
Commission renewed the licenses of both Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC
for terms of three years each, effective June 22, 2000. On May 21,
2003, the Mississippi Gaming Commission renewed the licenses of Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC
effective June 23, 2003 through June 22, 2006.



On May 18, 2000, the Mississippi Gaming Commission registered MGM
MIRAGE under the Mississippi Act as a publicly traded holding company
of Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC. As a registered publicly traded
corporation, MGM MIRAGE is subject to the licensing and regulatory
control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and is required to
periodically submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to
the Mississippi Gaming Commission and furnish any other information
which the Mississippi Gaming Commission may require. If MGM MIRAGE is
unable to satisfy the registration requirements of the Mississippi
Act, MGM MIRAGE and its licensed subsidiaries cannot own or operate
gaming facilities in Mississippi. Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC are
also required to periodically submit detailed financial, operating and
other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi
State Tax Commission and to furnish any other information required
thereby. No person may become a stockholder of or receive any
percentage of profits from a licensed subsidiary of a holding company
without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Mississippi
Gaming Commission.

Certain of our officers, directors and employees must be found
suitable or be licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We
believe that we have applied for all necessary findings of suitability
with respect to these persons, although the Mississippi Gaming
Commission, in its discretion, may require additional persons to file
applications for findings of suitability. In addition, any person
having a material relationship or involvement with us may be required
to be found suitable, in which case those persons must pay the costs
and fees associated with the investigation. A finding of suitability
requires submission of detailed personal and financial information
followed by a thorough investigation. There can be no assurance that
a person who is subject to a finding of suitability will be found
suitable by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming
Commission may deny an application for a finding of suitability for
any cause that it deems reasonable. Findings of suitability must be
periodically renewed.

Changes in certain licensed positions must be reported to the
Mississippi Gaming Commission. In addition to its authority to deny
an application for a finding of suitability, the Mississippi Gaming
Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a licensed
position. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to require
us to suspend or dismiss officers, directors and other key employees
or sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file
appropriate applications or whom the authorities find unsuitable to
act in their capacities.

Employees associated with gaming must obtain work permits that
are subject to immediate suspension. The Mississippi Gaming
Commission will refuse to issue a work permit to a person convicted of
a felony and it may refuse to issue a work permit to a gaming employee
if the employee has committed various misdemeanors or knowingly
violated the Mississippi Act or for any other reasonable cause.

At any time, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to
investigate and require a finding of suitability of any record or
beneficial stockholders of a publicly traded corporation registered
with the Mississippi Gaming Commission, regardless of the percentage
of ownership. Mississippi law requires any person who acquires more
than 5% of the voting securities of a publicly traded corporation
registered with the Mississippi Gaming Commission to report the
acquisition to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and that person may
be required to be found suitable. Also, any person who becomes a
beneficial owner of more than 10% of the voting securities of such a
company, as reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, must apply
for a finding of suitability by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. An
applicant for finding of suitability must pay the costs and fees that
the Mississippi Gaming Commission incurs in conducting the
investigation. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has generally
exercised its discretion to require a finding of suitability of any
beneficial owner of more than 5% of a registered public or private
company’s voting securities. However, the Mississippi Gaming
Commission has adopted a regulation that permits certain institutional
investors to own beneficially up to 15% and, under certain
circumstances, up to 19%, of a registered or licensed company’s voting
securities without a finding of suitability.

Under the regulations, an “institutional investor,” as defined
therein, may apply to the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission for a waiver of a finding of suitability if such
institutional investor (i) beneficially owns up to 15% (or, in certain
circumstances, up to 19%) of the voting securities of a registered or
licensed company, and (ii) holds the voting securities for investment
purposes only. An institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold
voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities
were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an
institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or
indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of
directors of the registered or licensed company, any change in the
registered or licensed company’s corporate charter, bylaws,
management, policies or operations of the registered public or private
company or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the
Mississippi Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding
the registered or licensed company’s voting securities for investment
purposes only.



Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding
voting securities for investment purposes only include:

If a stockholder who must be found suitable is a corporation,
partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial
information including a list of beneficial owners. The Mississippi
Gaming Commission may at any time dissolve, suspend, condition, limit
or restrict a finding of suitability to own a registered public
company’s equity interests for any cause it deems reasonable.

We may be required to disclose to the Mississippi Gaming
Commission upon request the identities of the holders of any debt or
other securities. In addition, under the Mississippi Act, the
Mississippi Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require holders
of debt securities of registered corporations to file applications,
investigate the holders, and require the holders to be found suitable
to own the debt securities.

Although the Mississippi Gaming Commission generally does not
require the individual holders of obligations such as notes to be
investigated and found suitable, the Mississippi Gaming Commission
retains the discretion to do so for any reason, including but not
limited to a default, or where the holder of the debt instrument
exercises a material influence over the gaming operations of the
entity in question. Any holder of debt securities required to apply
for a finding of suitability must pay all investigative fees and costs
of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection with the
investigation.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of
suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so
by the Mississippi Gaming Commission may be found unsuitable. Any
person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any
beneficial ownership of our securities beyond the time that the
Mississippi Gaming Commission prescribes, may be guilty of a
misdemeanor. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after
receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder, a
holder of our debt securities or to have any other relationship with
us, we:



Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC must maintain in Mississippi a
current ledger with respect to the ownership of their equity
securities and MGM MIRAGE must maintain in Mississippi a current list
of its stockholders which must reflect the record ownership of each
outstanding share of any equity security issued by MGM MIRAGE. The
ledger and stockholder lists must be available for inspection by the
Mississippi Gaming Commission at any time. If any of our securities
are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may
be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the
Mississippi Gaming Commission. A failure to make that disclosure may
be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. The Company must
also render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the
beneficial owner.

The Mississippi Act requires that the certificates representing
securities of a registered publicly traded corporation bear a legend
to the general effect that the securities are subject to the
Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission. On May 18, 2000, the Mississippi Gaming Commission
granted us a waiver of this legend requirement. The Mississippi
Gaming Commission has the power to impose additional restrictions on
us and the holders of our securities at any time.

Substantially all loans, leases, sales of securities and similar
financing transactions by a licensed gaming subsidiary must be
reported to or approved by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. A
licensed gaming subsidiary may not make a public offering of its
securities, but may pledge or mortgage casino facilities if it obtains
the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We may not
make a public offering of our securities without the prior approval of
the Mississippi Gaming Commission if any part of the proceeds of the
offering is to be used to finance the construction, acquisition or
operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or to retire or extend
obligations incurred for those purposes. The approval, if given, does
not constitute a recommendation or approval of the accuracy or
adequacy of the prospectus or the investment merits of the securities
subject to the offering. On September 24, 2003, the Mississippi
Gaming Commission granted us a waiver of the prior approval
requirement for our securities offerings for a period of two years,
subject to certain conditions. The waiver may be rescinded for good
cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop
order by the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

Under the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, Beau
Rivage Resorts and BRDC may not guarantee a security issued by MGM
MIRAGE pursuant to a public offering, or pledge their assets to secure
payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by such a security
issued by MGM MIRAGE, without the prior approval of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission. Similarly, MGM MIRAGE may not pledge the stock or
other ownership interests of Beau Rivage Resorts or BRDC, nor may the
pledgee of such ownership interests foreclose on such a pledge,
without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.
Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued by
Beau Rivage Resorts or BRDC and agreements not to encumber such
securities granted by MGM MIRAGE are ineffective without the prior
approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The waiver of the
prior approval requirement for MGM MIRAGE’s securities offerings
received from the Mississippi Gaming Commission on October 15, 2001
includes a waiver of the prior approval requirement for such
guarantees, pledges and restrictions of Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC,
subject to certain conditions.

MGM MIRAGE cannot change its control through merger,
consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting
agreements or any form of takeover without the prior approval of the
Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may
also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and other
persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity
proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part
of the approval process relating to the transaction.

The Mississippi Legislature has declared that some corporate
acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities
and other corporate defensive tactics that affect corporate gaming
licensees in Mississippi and corporations whose stock is publicly
traded that are affiliated with those licensees may be injurious to
stable and productive corporate gaming. The Mississippi Gaming
Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the
potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon
Mississippi’s gaming industry and to further Mississippi’s policy to
assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their
affiliates, preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in
the corporate form, and promote a neutral environment for the orderly
governance of corporate affairs.

MGM MIRAGE may be required to obtain approval from the
Mississippi Gaming Commission before it may make exceptional
repurchases of voting securities in excess of the current market price
of its common stock (commonly called “greenmail”) or before it may
consummate a corporate acquisition opposed by management. The
regulations also require prior approval by the Mississippi Gaming
Commission if MGM MIRAGE adopts a plan of recapitalization proposed by
its Board of Directors opposing a tender offer made directly to the
stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of MGM MIRAGE.



Neither MGM MIRAGE nor Beau Rivage Resorts may engage in gaming
activities in Mississippi while MGM MIRAGE, Beau Rivage Resorts and/or
persons found suitable to be associated with the gaming license of
Beau Rivage Resorts conduct gaming operations outside of Mississippi
without approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The
Mississippi Gaming Commission may require that it have access to
information concerning MGM MIRAGE’s and its affiliates’ out-of-state
gaming operations. Gaming operations in Nevada were approved when
Beau Rivage Resorts was first licensed in Mississippi. MGM MIRAGE has
received waivers of foreign gaming approval from the Mississippi
Gaming Commission for the conduct of gaming operations in Michigan,
New Jersey, Northern Territory – Australia, Mpumalanga and Gauteng
Provinces – Republic of South Africa (where we no longer engage in
gaming operations), California, New York and the United Kingdom, and
for cruises with Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines or Carnival Cruise Lines
which originate from the United States, and may be required to obtain
the approval or a waiver of such approval from the Mississippi Gaming
Commission before engaging in any additional future gaming operations
outside of Mississippi.

If the Mississippi Gaming Commission decides that a licensed
gaming subsidiary violated a gaming law or regulation, the Mississippi
Gaming Commission could limit, condition, suspend or revoke the
license of the subsidiary. In addition, we, the licensed subsidiary
and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for
each separate violation. A violation under any of MGM MIRAGE’s other
operating subsidiaries’ gaming licenses may be deemed a violation of
Beau Rivage Resorts’ gaming license. Because of a violation, the
Mississippi Gaming Commission could attempt to appoint a supervisor to
operate the casino facilities. Limitation, conditioning or suspension
of Beau Rivage Resorts’ gaming license or MGM MIRAGE’s registration as
a publicly traded holding company of Beau Rivage Resorts, or the
appointment of a supervisor could, and the revocation of any gaming
license or registration would, materially adversely affect our
Mississippi gaming operations.

A licensed gaming subsidiary must pay license fees and taxes,
computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming involved, to
the State of Mississippi and to the county or city in which the
licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations. Depending upon the
particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable
either monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage
of gross gaming revenues, the number of slot machines operated by the
casino, and the number of table games operated by the casino.

The license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based upon
“gaming receipts,” generally defined as gross receipts less payouts to
customers as winnings, and generally equals 8% of gaming receipts.
These license fees are allowed as a credit against our Mississippi
income tax liability for the year paid. The gross revenue fee imposed
by the Mississippi cities and counties in which casino operations are
located is in addition to the fees payable to the State of Mississippi
and equals approximately 4% of the gaming receipts.

The Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted a regulation in 1994
requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming
establishment’s plan include a 500-car parking facility in close
proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities which
will amount to at least 25% of the casino cost. Infrastructure
facilities are defined in the regulation to include a hotel with at
least 250 rooms, theme park, golf course and other similar facilities.
With the opening of its resort hotel and other amenities, Beau Rivage
Resorts is in compliance with this requirement. On January 21, 1999,
the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted an amendment to this
regulation which increased the infrastructure requirement to 100% from
the existing 25%; however, the regulation grandfathers existing
licensees and applies only to new casino projects and casinos that are
not operating at the time of acquisition or purchase, and would
therefore not apply to Beau Rivage Resorts. In any event, Beau Rivage
would comply with such requirement.

Both the local jurisdiction and the Alcoholic Beverage Control
Division of the Mississippi State Tax Commission license, control and
regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages by Beau Rivage Resorts. Beau
Rivage is in an area designated as a special resort area, which allows
casinos located therein to serve alcoholic beverages on a 24-hour
basis. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Division requires that the key
officers and managers of MGM MIRAGE and Beau Rivage Resorts and all
owners of more than 5% of Beau Rivage Resorts’ equity submit detailed
personal, and in some instances, financial information to the
Alcoholic Beverage Control Division and be investigated and licensed.
All such licenses are non-transferable. The Alcohol Beverage Control
Division has the full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any
license for the service of alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee
on probation with or without conditions. Any disciplinary action
could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon the
casino’s operations.



Australia Government Regulation

The Northern Territory of Australia has comprehensive laws and
regulations governing the conduct of gaming. Our Australian
operations are subject to the Northern Territory Gaming Control Act
and regulations promulgated thereunder and to the licensing and
general control of the Minister for Racing, Gaming and Licensing and
the Director of Licensing. MGM Grand Australia Pty Ltd. and Diamond
Leisure Pty Ltd (a subsidiary of MGM Grand Australia Pty Ltd operating
as MGM Grand Darwin) have entered into a casino operator’s agreement
with the Minister pursuant to which Diamond Leisure Pty Ltd was
granted a license to conduct casino gaming on an exclusive basis
through June 30, 2015 in the northern half of the Northern Territory
(which includes Darwin, its largest city, where MGM Grand Australia is
located). The license provides for a tax payable to the Northern
Territory government on gross profits derived from gaming, including
gaming devices. The license is not exclusive with respect to gaming
devices, and the Minister may permit such devices to be placed in
limited numbers in locations not operated by Diamond Leisure Pty Ltd
or MGM Grand Australia. However, under the license, through June 30,
2005 a portion of the operators’ win on such gaming devices is to be
offset against gaming tax otherwise payable by MGM Grand Australia.

The license may be terminated if Diamond Leisure Pty Ltd breaches
the casino operator’s agreement or the Northern Territory law or fails
to operate in accordance with the requirements of the license. The
Northern Territory authorities have the right under the Northern
Territory law, the casino operator’s agreement and the license to
monitor and approve virtually all aspects of the conduct of gaming by
Diamond Leisure Pty Ltd.

Additionally, under the terms of the license, the Minister has
the right to approve the directors and corporate secretary of MGM
MIRAGE and its subsidiaries that own or operate the MGM Grand Darwin
Casino, as well as changes in the ownership or corporate structure of
such subsidiaries. Diamond Leisure Pty Ltd is required to file with
the Northern Territory authorities copies of all documents required to
be filed by MGM MIRAGE or any of its subsidiaries with the Nevada
gaming authorities, if the documents relate in any way to the MGM
Grand Darwin Casino, Diamond Leisure’s conduct of the casino or the
casino site. In the event of any person becoming the beneficial owner
of 10% or more of our stock, the Minister must be so notified and may
investigate the suitability of such person. If the Minister
determines such person to be unsuitable, and following such
determination such person remains the beneficial owner of 10% or more
of our stock, that circumstance would constitute a default under the
license.

New Jersey Government Regulation

The ownership and operation of hotel-casino facilities and gaming
activities in Atlantic City, New Jersey are subject to extensive state
regulation under the New Jersey Casino Control Act and the regulations
of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and other applicable laws.
The New Jersey Act also established the New Jersey Division of Gaming
Enforcement to investigate all license applications, enforce the
provisions of the New Jersey Act and regulations and prosecute all
proceedings for violations of the New Jersey Act and regulations
before the New Jersey Commission. In order to own or operate a
hotel-casino property in New Jersey, a company must obtain a license
or other approvals from the New Jersey Commission and obtain numerous
other licenses, permits and approvals from other state as well as
local governmental authorities.

The New Jersey Commission has broad discretion regarding the
issuance, renewal, revocation and suspension of casino licenses. The
New Jersey Act and regulations concern primarily the good character,
honesty, integrity and financial stability of casino licensees, their
intermediary and holding companies, their employees, their security
holders and others financially interested in casino operations;
financial and accounting practices used in connection with casino
operations; rules of games, levels of supervision of games and methods
of selling and redeeming chips; manner of granting credit, duration of
credit and enforceability of gaming debts; and distribution of
alcoholic beverages.

On June 11, 2003, the New Jersey Commission issued a casino
license to the Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa and found MGM MIRAGE and
certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and their then officers,
directors, and 5% or greater shareholders suitable.

The New Jersey Act further provides that each person who directly
or indirectly holds any beneficial interest in or ownership of the
securities issued by a casino licensee or any of its intermediary or
holding companies, those persons who, in the opinion of the New Jersey
Commission, have the ability to control the casino licensee or its
intermediary or holding companies or elect a majority of the board of
directors of such companies, other than a banking or other licensed
lending institution which makes a loan or holds a mortgage or other
lien acquired in the ordinary course of business, lenders and
underwriters of such companies are required to be qualified by the New
Jersey Commission. However, with respect to a holding company such as
MGM MIRAGE, a waiver of qualification may be granted by the New Jersey
Commission, with the concurrence of the Director of the New Jersey
Division, if the New Jersey Commission determines that such persons or
entities are not significantly involved in the activities of a casino
licensee and in the case of security holders, do not



have the ability to control MGM MIRAGE or elect one or more of its
directors. There exists a rebuttable presumption that any person
holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a casino licensee’s
intermediary or holding company or a person having the ability to
elect one or more of the directors of such a company has the ability
to control the company and thus must obtain qualification from the New
Jersey Commission.

Notwithstanding this presumption of control, the New Jersey Act
provides for a waiver of qualification for passive “institutional
investors,” as defined by the New Jersey Act, if the institutional
investor purchased publicly traded securities for investment purposes
only and where such securities constitute less than 10% of the equity
securities of a casino licensee’s holding or intermediary company or
debt securities of a casino licensee’s holding or intermediary company
representing a percentage of the outstanding debt of such company not
exceeding 20% or a percentage of any issue of the outstanding debt of
such company not exceeding 50%. The waiver of qualification is
subject to certain conditions including, upon request of the New
Jersey Commission, filing a certified statement that the institutional
investor has no intention of influencing or affecting the affairs of
the issuer, except that an institutional investor holding voting
securities shall be permitted to vote on matters put to a vote of the
holders of outstanding voting securities. Additionally, a waiver of
qualification may also be granted to institutional investors holding a
higher percentage of securities of a casino licensee’s holding or
intermediary company upon a showing of good cause.

The New Jersey Act requires the certificate of incorporation of a
publicly traded holding company to provide that any securities of such
a corporation are held subject to the condition that if a holder is
found to be disqualified by the New Jersey Commission pursuant to the
New Jersey Act, such holder shall dispose of his interest in such
company. Accordingly, we amended our certificate of incorporation to
provide that a holder of our securities must dispose of such
securities if the holder is found disqualified under the New Jersey
Act. In addition, we amended our certificate of incorporation to
provide that we may redeem the stock of any holder found to be
disqualified.

If the New Jersey Commission should find a security holder to be
unqualified to be a holder of securities of a casino licensee or
holding company, not only must the disqualified holder dispose of such
securities but in addition, commencing on the date the New Jersey
Commission serves notice upon such a company of the determination of
disqualification, it shall be unlawful for the disqualified holder to:

•

receive any dividends or interest upon any such securities;

•

exercise, directly or through any trustee or nominee, any right conferred by such securities; or

•

receive any remuneration in any form from the licensee for services rendered or otherwise.

If the New Jersey Commission should find a security holder to be
unqualified to be a holder of securities of a casino licensee or
holding company, the New Jersey Commission shall take any necessary
action to protect the public interest, including the suspension or
revocation of the casino license, except that if the disqualified
person is the holder of securities of a publicly traded holding
company, the New Jersey Commission shall not take action against the
casino license if:

•

the holding company has the corporate charter provisions
concerning divestiture of securities by disqualified owners
required by the New Jersey Act;

•

the holding company has made good faith efforts, including
the pursuit of legal remedies, to comply with any order of the
New Jersey Commission; and

•

the disqualified holder does not have the ability to
control the company or elect one or more members of the company’s
board of directors.

If the New Jersey Commission determines that a casino licensee
has violated the New Jersey Act or regulations, or if any security
holder of MGM MIRAGE or a casino licensee who is required to be
qualified under the New Jersey Act is found to be disqualified but
does not dispose of the securities, a casino licensee could be subject
to fines or its license could be suspended or revoked. If a casino
licensee’s license is revoked after issuance, the New Jersey
Commission could appoint a conservator to operate and to dispose of
the hotel-casino facilities operated by such casino licensee. Net
proceeds of a sale by a conservator and net profits of operations by a
conservator, at least up to an amount equal to a fair return on
investment which is reasonable for casinos or hotels, would be paid to
us.



The New Jersey Act imposes an annual tax of 8% on gross casino
revenues, as defined in the New Jersey Act, a 4.25% tax on the value
of rooms, food beverage or entertainment provided at no cost or a
reduced price, a $3 tax per day on each occupied hotel room, a $3
parking tax per day and, through June 30, 2006, a 7.5% tax on
“adjusted net income”, as defined in the New Jersey Act, subject to
certain minimums and limitations. In addition, casino licensees are
required to invest 1.25% of gross casino revenues for the purchase of
bonds to be issued by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority or
make other approved investments equal to that amount. In the event
the investment requirement is not met, the casino licensee is subject
to a tax in the amount of 2.5% on gross casino revenues. The New
Jersey Commission has established fees for the issuance or renewal of
casino licenses and hotel-casino alcoholic beverage licenses and an
annual license fee on each slot machine.

In addition to compliance with the New Jersey Act and regulations
relating to gaming, any property built in Atlantic City by us must
comply with the New Jersey and Atlantic City laws and regulations
relating to, among other things, the Coastal Area Facilities Review
Act, construction of buildings, environmental considerations and the
operation of hotels. Any changes to such laws or the laws regarding
gaming could have an adverse effect on the Company.

Factors that May Affect Our Future Results

(Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995)

This Form 10-K and our 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders contain
some forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our
current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify
these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to
historical or current facts. They contain words such as “anticipate,”
“estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “may,”
“could,” “might” and other words or phrases of similar meaning in
connection with any discussion of future operating or financial
performance. In particular, these include statements relating to
future actions, new projects, future performance, the outcome of
contingencies such as legal proceedings and future financial results.
From time to time, we also provide oral or written forward-looking
statements in our Forms 10-Q and 8-K, press releases and other
materials we release to the public. Any or all of our forward-looking
statements in this Form 10-K, in our 2003 Annual Report to
Stockholders and in any other public statements we make may turn out
to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might
make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors
mentioned in this Form 10-K — for example, government regulation and
the competitive environment — will be important in determining our
future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be
guaranteed. Our actual future results may differ materially.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking
statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or
otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further
disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K
reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also note that we
provide the following discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible
inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors
that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from
expected and historical results. Other factors in addition to those
listed here could also adversely affect us. This discussion is
provided as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act
of 1995.

•

We have significant indebtedness. At December 31, 2003, we
had approximately $5.5 billion of indebtedness, which increased
from approximately $5.2 billion at December 31, 2002. The
interest rate on a large portion of our long-term debt is subject
to fluctuation based on changes in short-term interest rates and
the ratings which national rating agencies assign to our
outstanding debt securities. Our bank credit agreements and the
indentures governing our debt securities do not prohibit us from
borrowing additional funds in the future. Our interest expense
could increase as a result of these factors. Additionally, our
indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse
economic and industry conditions, limit our flexibility in
planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry,
limit our ability to borrow additional funds and place us at a
competitive disadvantage compared to other less leveraged
competitors. Our ability to reduce our outstanding debt will be
subject to our future cash flows, other capital requirements and
other factors, some of which are not within our control.





•

Our plans for future construction can be affected by a number of
factors, including time delays in obtaining necessary governmental
permits and approvals and legal challenges. We may make changes in
project scope, budgets and schedules for competitive, aesthetic or
other reasons, and these changes may also result from circumstances
beyond our control. These circumstances include weather
interference, shortages of materials and labor, work stoppages,
labor disputes, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological
problems and unanticipated cost increases. Any of these
circumstances could give rise to delays or cost overruns. Major
expansion projects at our existing resorts can also result in
disruption of our business during the construction period.

•

Claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in
various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims
arise from time to time. It is possible that our cash flows and
results of operations could be affected by the resolution of
these claims. We believe that the ultimate disposition of
current matters will not have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations. Please see the further
discussion under “Legal Proceedings” in Item 3 of this Form 10-K.

•

There is intense competition to attract and retain qualified
management and other employees in the gaming industry. Our
inability to recruit or retain personnel could adversely affect
our business.

•

Tracinda Corporation beneficially owns approximately 57% of
our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2003. As a
result, Tracinda Corporation has the ability to elect our entire
Board of Directors and determine the outcome of other matters
submitted to our stockholders, such as the approval of
significant transactions.

You should also be aware that while we from time to time
communicate with securities analysts, we do not disclose to them any
material non-public information, internal forecasts or other
confidential business information. Therefore, you should not assume
that we agree with any statement or report issued by any analyst,
irrespective of the content of the statement or report. To the extent
that reports issued by securities analysts contain projections,
forecasts or opinions, those reports are not our responsibility.

Available Information

We maintain a website, www.mgmmirage.com, which includes
financial and other information for investors. We provide access to
our SEC filings on our website, free of charge, through a link to the
SEC’s EDGAR database. Through that link, our filings are available as
soon as reasonably practicable after we file the documents.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Substantially all of the Company’s assets other than assets of
its foreign subsidiaries and certain assets in use at MGM Grand
Detroit have been pledged as collateral for our senior notes and
principal credit facilities. These notes and facilities had
outstanding balances of approximately $4.4 billion at December 31,
2003.

Bellagio occupies an approximately 90-acre site. We own the
entire site except for one acre which we lease under a ground lease
that expires (giving effect to our options to renew) in 2073. Our
principal executive offices are located at Bellagio. MGM Grand Las
Vegas occupies an approximately 116-acre site which we own – we will
contribute 3 acres to the venture formed with Turnberry Associates to
develop luxury condominium towers. The Mirage and TI share an
approximately 100-acre site which we own. New York-New York occupies
an approximately 20-acre site which we own.



The
Primm Valley Resorts are located on approximately 143 acres. We
lease substantially all of the land under a ground lease that expires
(giving effect to our renewal option) in 2068. We own approximately
16 acres immediately north of Buffalo Bill’s. We also own
approximately 573 acres in California, four miles south of Primm,
which is the location of the Primm Valley Golf Club. Approximately
125 of these acres remain available for future development. Primm
Valley Resorts are not served by a municipal water system. We have
rights to water in various wells located on federal land in the
vicinity of the Primm Valley Resorts and have received permits to pipe
the water to the Primm Valley Resorts. These permits and rights are
subject to the jurisdiction and ongoing regulatory authority of the
U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the States of Nevada and California
and local governmental units. We believe that adequate water for the
Primm Valley Resorts is available; however, we cannot be certain that
the future needs will be within the permitted allowance. Also, we can
give no assurance that any future requests for additional water will
be approved or that no further requirements will be imposed by
governmental agencies on our use and delivery of water for the Primm
Valley Resorts.

The Boardwalk occupies an approximately nine-acre site which we
own. We also own approximately 40 acres of property adjacent to the
Boardwalk which is available for future development. Monte Carlo
occupies approximately 46 acres owned by Victoria Partners (the joint
venture that owns and operates Monte Carlo). We own approximately 306
acres of land in North Las Vegas, including 240 acres occupied by
Shadow Creek.

MGM Grand Detroit is located on approximately 8 acres which we
own. Beau Rivage occupies approximately 41 acres (including 10 acres
of tidelands) in Biloxi, Mississippi. We own the land and we lease
the tidelands from the State of Mississippi under a lease that expires
(giving effect to our option to renew) in 2049. We also own
approximately 508 acres in the Biloxi area for future development.

MGM Grand Australia occupies an approximately 18-acre site which
we own. At December 31, 2003, MGM Grand Australia was subject to a
mortgage securing bank financing of approximately $12 million.

We own approximately 185 acres in Atlantic City consisting
principally of three different parcels in casino-zoned areas. Borgata
occupies 29 acres at Renaissance Pointe, including two acres we lease
to Borgata and on which Borgata constructed its employee parking
garage. The remaining 27 acres Borgata occupies is owned by the
venture and collateralized by a mortgage securing bank credit
facilities in the amount of up to $630 million. As of December 31,
2003, $606 million was outstanding under the bank credit facility.

We also own or lease various other improved and unimproved
property in Las Vegas and other locations in the United States and
certain foreign countries.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Poulos Slot Machine Litigation

On April 26, 1994, an individual filed a complaint in a class
action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Florida against 41 manufacturers, distributors and casino
operators of video poker and electronic slot machines, including the
Company. On May 10, 1994, another plaintiff filed a complaint in a
class action lawsuit alleging substantially the same claims in the
same court against 48 defendants, including the Company. On September
26, 1995, another plaintiff filed a complaint in a class action
lawsuit alleging substantially the same claims in the United States
District Court for the District of Nevada against 45 defendants,
including the Company. The court consolidated the three cases in the
United States District Court for the District of Nevada.

The consolidated complaint claims that we and the other
defendants have engaged in a course of fraudulent and misleading
conduct intended to induce people to play video poker and electronic
slot machines based on a false belief concerning how the gaming
machines operate, as well as the chances of winning. Specifically,
the plaintiffs allege that the gaming machines are not truly random as
advertised to the public, but are pre-programmed in a predictable and
manipulative manner. The complaint alleges violations of the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, as well as claims
of common law fraud, unjust enrichment and negligent
misrepresentation, and asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages. In December 1997, the court granted in part and denied in
part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to
state a claim and ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint,
which they filed in February 1998. We, along with most of the other
defendants, answered the amended complaint and continue to deny the
allegations contained in the amended complaint. The parties have
fully briefed the issues regarding class certification, which are
currently pending before the court.



In June 2002, the U.S. District Court in Nevada ruled that the
plaintiffs met the prerequisite requirements for class-action status,
but the Court denied the plaintiff’s motion for class action
certification, saying that the proposed class lacked the cohesiveness
required to settle common claims against the casino industry. The
court had previously stayed discovery pending resolution of these
class certification issues. In August 2002, the 9

th

Circuit Court of
Appeals granted the plaintiffs the right to appeal the district
court’s order denying the motion for class certification. Briefings
before the 9

th

Circuit Court have been completed and oral arguments
were presented in January 2004. A ruling from the 9

th

Circuit Court
is expected sometime in 2004.

Boardwalk Shareholder Litigation

On September 28, 1999, a former stockholder of our subsidiary
which owns and operates the Boardwalk Hotel and Casino filed a first
amended complaint in a putative class action lawsuit in District Court
for Clark County, Nevada against Mirage and certain former directors
and principal stockholders of the Boardwalk subsidiary. The complaint
alleged that Mirage induced the other defendants to breach their
fiduciary duties to Boardwalk’s minority stockholders by devising and
implementing a scheme by which Mirage acquired Boardwalk at
significantly less than the true value of its shares. The complaint
sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages from Mirage and
punitive damages from the other defendants, whom we are required to
defend and indemnify.

In June 2000, the court granted our motion to dismiss the
complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be
granted. The plaintiff appealed the ruling to the Nevada Supreme
Court. The parties filed briefs with the Nevada Supreme Court, and
oral arguments were conducted in October 2001. In February 2003, the
Nevada Supreme Court overturned the District Court’s order granting
our motion to dismiss the complaint and remanded the case to the
District Court for further proceedings on the elements of the lawsuit
involving wrongful conduct in approving the merger and/or in the
valuation of the merged corporation’s shares. The Nevada Supreme
Court affirmed the District Court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s
claims for lost profits and mismanagement. The Nevada Supreme Court’s
ruling relates only to the District Court’s ruling on our motion to
dismiss and is not a determination of the merits of the plaintiff’s
case. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint, and in October 2003,
the District Court certified the action as a class action. Written
discovery is underway, and depositions are expected to occur sometime
in 2004. We will continue to vigorously defend our position that the
plaintiff’s claims are without merit.

Detroit Slot Machine Litigation

On July 18, 2001, an individual, Mary Kraft, filed a complaint in
the Wayne County Circuit Court in Detroit, Michigan, against
International Game Technology, Anchor Gaming, Inc. and the three
operators of casinos in Detroit, Michigan, including a subsidiary of
the Company. The plaintiff claims the bonus wheel feature of the Wheel
of Fortune® and I Dream of Jeannie™ slot machines, which are
manufactured, designed and programmed by International Game Technology
and/or Anchor Gaming, Inc., are deceptive and misleading.
Specifically, plaintiff alleges that the bonus wheels on these games
do not randomly land on a given dollar amount but are programmed to
provide a predetermined frequency of pay-outs. The complaint alleges
violations of the Michigan Consumer Protection Act, common law fraud
and unjust enrichment and asks for unspecified compensatory and
punitive damages, disgorgement of profits, injunctive and other
equitable relief, and costs and attorney’s fees. The plaintiff seeks
to certify a class of any individual in Michigan who has played either
of these games since June of 1999. The machines and their programs
were approved for use by the Michigan Gaming Control Board, the
administrative agency responsible for policing the Detroit casinos.

We, along with the other casino operators, filed a motion for
summary disposition arguing that the plaintiff’s complaint fails to
state a claim as a matter of law. Additionally, we, along with the
other casino operators, filed motions for summary disposition arguing
that the plaintiff’s common law claims are preempted by the Michigan
Act, that the court has no jurisdiction to decide this matter and that
all the allegations in the complaint regarding the alleged deceptive
nature of the machines are directed to the manufacturers of the
machines and are not the casinos’ responsibility. In April 2002, the
Wayne County Circuit Court granted the motion for summary disposition.
The plaintiff appealed and, after a full briefing of the case, oral
argument was held in November 2003. The Michigan Court of Appeals has
not yet issued a decision on the appeal.

Lac Vieux Litigation

In January 2002, the 6

th

Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in the
case of Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v.
Michigan Gaming Control Board, et. al., that a preference contained in
the Detroit Casino Selection Process Ordinance, in Detroit, Michigan,
violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. The

th

Circuit Court remanded the case to the Federal District Court to
determine what relief was appropriate. The Company’s operating
subsidiary had not been granted a preference by the City of Detroit,
and was not originally a party to the Lac Vieux litigation. In April
2002, such subsidiary intervened in the Lac Vieux litigation in order
to protect its interest.



In July 2002, the District Court denied the Lac Vieux Tribe’s
request for a new casino development selection process in the City of
Detroit, finding that the magnitude of such relief was not warranted
and that the harm to the casino licensees and the City would be
manifestly worse than any benefit the Tribe might receive. The
District Court declared that our subsidiary did not receive a
preference and, in fact, was injured by the preference. The Federal
District Court determined that the only relief that it could equitably
grant to the Tribe was declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. Our
subsidiary had previously petitioned the Court for a ruling that its
selection was valid in that it did not receive any preferences in the
selection process. In light of the ruling that no further relief
would be granted to the Tribe, the Court denied this motion on the
ground of mootness. The Tribe appealed the District Court’s ruling,
and the Tribe requested that the District Court enjoin the City from
approving new development agreements with the three casino developers
until resolution of the appeal by the 6

th

Circuit Court. The District
Court denied the request for the injunction, and the appeal is
pending. Our subsidiary filed a cross appeal of the District Court’s
denial of the subsidiary’s motion.

In September 2002, the 6

th

Circuit Court issued an injunction,
pending appeal, prohibiting the City from issuing construction permits
to the developers and prohibiting the developers from commencing
construction pending further action of the 6

th

Circuit Court. The
parties completed briefings of the case in August 2003. We argued,
among other things, that the preference provisions of the ordinance
found unconstitutional are severable from the valid provisions of the
ordinance, and that our subsidiary was not eligible for and did not
seek or receive a preference in the selection process. The 6

th

Circuit Court has not set a schedule for argument of the appeal.

In December 2003, the Tribe and the owners of the two other
casinos filed a joint motion with the 6

th

Circuit Court requesting
approval of the terms of a partial settlement, asserted to have
resolved the case among the filing parties. The settlement calls for
exemption of those developers from a reselection process and other
related relief, in exchange for cash payments to the Tribe, but
purports to continue the Tribe’s appeal as it relates to our
subsidiary. In a subsequent filing, the settling parties requested
that issues pertaining to this partial settlement be remanded to the
District Court for consideration. We filed a responsive motion with
the 6

th

Circuit Court requesting dismissal of the appeal as moot, or,
upon denial of such relief, expedited decision of our cross appeal and
a full briefing on the issues surrounding the proposed partial
settlement. These motions remain pending.

Other

We and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other
lawsuits, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our
business. We do not believe that the outcome of this other pending
litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a material adverse
effect on the Company.

There were approximately 3,538 record holders of our common stock
as of February 4, 2004.

We have not paid dividends on our common stock in the last two
fiscal years. We intend to retain our earnings to fund the operation
of our business, to service and repay our debt, to make strategic
investments in high return growth projects at our proven resorts, to
repurchase shares of common stock and to reserve our capital to raise
our capacity to capture investment opportunities overseas and in
emerging domestic markets. Furthermore, as a holding company with no
independent operations, our ability to pay dividends will depend upon
the receipt of dividends and other payment from our subsidiaries. Our
senior credit facility contains financial covenants that could
restrict our ability to pay dividends. Our Board of Directors
periodically reviews our policy with respect to dividends, and any
determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the sole
discretion of the Board of Directors.

On December 13, 1999 the Board of Directors approved an initial quarterly
cash dividend of $0.10 per share to stockholders of record on February 10,
2000. The dividend was paid on March 1, 2000. As a result of the
acquisition of Mirage Resorts, Incorporated, we announced on April 19,
2000 that the quarterly dividend policy was discontinued.

New York-New York was 50% owned until March 1, 1999 when the Company
acquired the remaining 50%. The Primm Valley Resorts were acquired on March 1,
1999. MGM Grand South Africa managed casinos in the Republic of South Africa
from October 1997 through May 2002. MGM Grand Detroit commenced operations in
July 1999. The Mirage acquisition occurred on May 31, 2000.

In June 2003, we entered into an agreement to sell our Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries, including substantially all of the assets and liabilities of
those resorts. This transaction closed in January 2004. Also in June 2003, we
ceased operations of PLAYMGMMIRAGE.com, our online gaming website (“Online”).
The results of the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries and Online are classified as
discontinued operations for all periods presented.



ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Our Current Operations

Our operations consist of 12 wholly-owned casino resorts and 50%
investments in two other casino resorts, including:

Las Vegas, Nevada:

Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, The
Mirage, TI, New York-New York, Boardwalk, and Monte Carlo
(50% owned).

Other domestic:

The Primm Valley Resorts (Buffalo Bill’s,
Primm Valley Resort and Whiskey Pete’s) in Primm, Nevada;
Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; MGM Grand Detroit;
Borgata (50% owned) in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

International:

MGM Grand Australia in Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia

We operate in one segment, the operation of casino resorts, which
includes offering gaming, hotel, dining, entertainment, retail and
other resort amenities. Slightly over half of our net revenues are
derived from gaming activities, a lower percentage than many of our
competitors, as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete
resort experience for our guests, including non-gaming amenities which
command a premium price based on their quality.

We generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income
from our Las Vegas Strip resorts. In 2003, over 75% of our net
revenues and operating income was generated by wholly-owned Las Vegas
Strip resorts. We believe that we own the premier casino resorts on
the Las Vegas Strip, and a main focus of our strategy is to
continually reinvest in these resorts to maintain that competitive
advantage. Our concentration on the Las Vegas Strip exposes us to
certain risks outside of our control, such as competition from other
Las Vegas Strip resorts, including a major new competitor expected to
open in 2005, and the impact from potential expansion of gaming in
California. This concentration also exposes us to risks related to
tourism and the general economy, including national and global
economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global events.

Key Performance Indicators

As a resort-based company, our operating results are highly
dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn
impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other
amenities. We also generate a significant portion of our operating
income from the high-end gaming segment, which can cause variability
in our results. Key performance indicators related to revenue are:

•

Gaming revenue indicators – table games drop and slot
handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which
is not fully controllable by us. Our normal table games win
percentage is in the range of 18% to 22% of table games drop
and our normal slot win percentage is in the range of 6% to 7%
of slot handle;

•

Hotel revenue indicators – hotel occupancy (volume
indicator); average daily rate (“ADR”, price indicator);
revenue per available room (“REVPAR”), a summary measure of
hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate.

Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers
wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or
credit cards. Our resorts, like many in the industry, generate
significant operating cash flow. Our industry is capital intensive
and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate
operating cash flow to repay debt financing, fund maintenance capital
expenditures and provide excess cash for future development.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature,
though a variety of factors can affect the results of any interim
period, including the timing of major Las Vegas conventions, the
amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end
customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New
Year and Chinese New Year.



Overall Outlook

We have invested heavily in our existing operations in 2002 and
2003, and expect to continue to do so in 2004. Our Las Vegas Strip
resorts require ongoing capital investment to maintain their
competitive advantages. We believe the investments in additional
non-gaming amenities we made in 2003 and our planned spending in 2004
will further position our resorts to capitalize on the expected
continued economic recovery. Borgata, which opened in July 2003, will
have a more meaningful impact on our operating results in 2004, given
a full year of operations.

MGM Grand Detroit operates in an interim casino facility, and we
have plans to develop a permanent casino resort, though our ability to
do so is currently limited pending resolution of certain litigation.
We expect the permanent casino resort to cost approximately $575
million, a significant amount of which may be invested in 2004 and
2005.

We have made several strategic agreements to take advantage of
currently proposed gaming law reforms in the United Kingdom. The
timing of adoption of these reforms, if they are adopted at all, is
uncertain. However, we believe that the gaming market in the UK would be profitable assuming a reasonable tax and regulatory structure,
and a market in which our style of resorts and our management expertise
would provide us with a competitive advantage.

In January 2004, we announced the proposed acquisition of Wembley
plc. If completed, this acquisition would provide us with a gaming
facility in Rhode Island, allowing us to further diversify into the
northeast United States, a gaming market we consider to be
under-served. Wembley also owns several greyhound tracks in the
United Kingdom, which could provide sites for additional casino
development, subject to the same risks and
uncertainties as our other potential investments in the United
Kingdom.

We also own two premium casino development sites in existing
markets, one on the Las Vegas Strip between Bellagio and Monte Carlo
and one at Renaissance Pointe in Atlantic City, adjacent to Borgata.
The timing or extent of any development on these sites is uncertain.

Income from continuing operations decreased in 2003 due to lower
operating income and higher interest expense resulting from lower
capitalized interest and, to a lesser extent, increased borrowings.
Our long-term debt increased approximately 6%, primarily in the fourth
quarter, in order to fund capital investments and share repurchases.
In 2002, income from continuing operations increased as a result of
the significant one-time expenses incurred in 2001, along with stable
payroll expenses as a result of restructuring activity in late 2001
and a significantly lower provision for doubtful accounts. Also
contributing to the increase in 2002 was significantly lower interest
expense, as variable interest rates decreased in 2002 and we reduced
long-term debt by approximately 4% in 2002.

Results on a per share basis were positively impacted by a lower
weighted average number of shares outstanding, particularly in 2003.
This is the result of share repurchases throughout 2002 and 2003.



Operating Results

The following table includes key information about our operating
results:

On a consolidated basis, the most important factors and trends
contributing to our operating performance over the last three years
have been:

As a result of the above trends, our net revenues increased 3% in
2003, including a higher percentage increase in the second half of the
year, while increasing only 2% in 2002. New York-New York experienced
a 23% increase in net revenues due to the addition of

Zumanity

, the
newest show from Cirque du Soleil, which opened in August 2003 and
other amenities, including a new Irish pub, Nine Fine Irishmen, which
opened in July 2003. Bellagio’s revenues were flat despite the
negative effects of SARS and the Iraq war in early 2003 and having 17%
of its standard rooms out of service in the fourth quarter.
Bellagio’s REVPAR increased 7% for the year, but on a base of fewer
rooms due to an ongoing project to remodel all of Bellagio’s standard
rooms. Bellagio’s other indicators were also strong, including a 5%
increase in slot revenues. Similarly, net revenues increased 3% at
MGM Grand Las Vegas, with a higher rate of increase in the second half
of 2003 due to increased non-gaming spending and the addition of
several new food and beverage outlets.

Our operating income in 2003 decreased 6%, due primarily to
higher payroll and benefits expenses, which constitutes slightly over
half of our casino and hotel operations and general and administrative
expenses. Total payroll and benefits was up 6%, largely due to a 19%
increase in health insurance costs, along with 3% higher salaries and
wages. Our contract with the Culinary Union covering approximately
13,000 of our Las Vegas employees became effective June 1, 2002. The
contract calls for increases in wages and health and welfare
contributions of 4-5% per year over the five year term of the
contract. The increase in payroll and benefits was partially offset
by higher income from unconsolidated affiliates after Borgata opened
in July 2003.



Operating income at Bellagio decreased 22% in 2003 due to the
additional impact of the standard room remodel project. New York-New
York’s operating income increased as a result of the contribution of

Zumanity

and other new amenities. MGM Grand Las Vegas experienced a
5% decline in operating income in 2003. However, excluding
restructuring charges related to restaurant leases, preopening and
start-up expenses related to new amenities, and property transactions
related to the construction of a new theatre, this resort’s operating
income would have increased 6%. MGM Grand Las Vegas’ 2004 results
will benefit from the theatre, which will house a show by Cirque du
Soleil opening in mid-2004. Beau Rivage’s operating income increased
significantly over 2002 due to the positive impact of a remodeled and
expanded buffet as well as several other new restaurants opened during
2003 and the conversion of a floor of standard rooms into suites.
Also, Beau Rivage recorded a charge of $8 million in 2002 for property
damage related to Tropical Storm Isidore, while no such costs were
incurred in 2003. Corporate expense increased in 2003 due primarily
to increased development activities and increased property taxes on
the Renaissance Pointe land in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

In 2002, our operating income increased 24%. A large factor in
the increase was the significant one-time expenses incurred in 2001 in
relation to the September 11, 2001 attacks, including restructuring
charges and asset impairment charges. Excluding the impact of these
charges and preopening and start-up expenses, operating income
increased 13%, largely due to stable payroll expenses as a result of
restructuring activity in late 2001, and a significantly lower
provision for doubtful accounts.

Operating Results – Detailed Revenue Information

The following table presents detail of our net revenues:

Table games revenues decreased 2% in 2002, even with a slightly
higher hold percentage, resulting from the impacts of the September 11
attacks on our foreign high-end customers and the impacts of the
United States economy on our national customers. Table games revenues
decreased 3% in 2003, as a slightly lower hold percentage and the
impact of the Iraq war and SARS outbreak in early 2003 were not fully
offset by strong volume levels over the latter half of 2003.

Slot revenues increased substantially in both 2002 and 2003.
Improvements were the result of enhanced marketing programs, the
impact of our Players Club rewards program, which was implemented in
our major resorts over 2002 and 2003, and the implementation of
cashless gaming technology in 2003. A majority of slot machines at
our major resorts now offer ticket-in, ticket-out technology through
International Game Technology’s EZ-Pay™ system. Slot win percentages
were consistent among all three periods.

Non-casino revenue increased in 2003 primarily due to increased
occupancy at our resorts, which also drives the level of spending at
food and beverage, entertainment and retail outlets. In addition, we
were able to increase the pricing for our rooms and other non-gaming
amenities. Our hotel results began to improve notably in the latter
half of 2003, particularly at our Las Vegas Strip resorts. For the
year ended December 31, 2003 REVPAR at our Las Vegas Strip resorts was
$126 compared to $119 in 2002, an increase of 6%. In 2002, other
revenues included proceeds of $11 million for the termination of our
management agreement covering four casinos in the Republic of South
Africa.

In 2003, our primary restructuring activities included closing
two marketing offices and terminating the related leases, terminating
a lease agreement with a restaurant tenant at MGM Grand Las Vegas, and
closing the Siegfried & Roy show, which resulted in a charge for
employee severance costs.

In December 2002, we recorded a restructuring credit of $10
million related to a lease contract termination accrual originally
recorded in June 2000 as we determined that payment under this
obligation was not probable. We recorded $3 million of restructuring
charges in December 2002 related to contract termination costs for a
restaurant lease and the EFX! show at MGM Grand Las Vegas.

During the third and fourth quarters of 2001, management
responded to a decline in business volumes caused by the September 11
attacks by implementing cost containment strategies which included a
significant reduction in payroll and a refocusing of several of our
marketing programs. Approximately 6,700 employees (on a full-time
equivalent basis) were laid off or terminated, resulting in a $22
million charge against earnings, primarily related to the accrual of
severance pay, extended health care coverage and other related costs
in connection with these personnel reductions. As a result of
improving business levels and our success at re-hiring a substantial
number of previously laid off or terminated employees, management
determined in the second quarter of 2002 that a portion of the
remaining accrual was no longer necessary. This resulted in a
restructuring credit of $10 million in 2002.

In 2003, we sold 315 acres of land in North Las Vegas, Nevada
near Shadow Creek for approximately $55 million, resulting in the $37
million gain reflected above. Prior to 2003, we classified gains and
losses on routine assets sales or disposals as a non-operating item at
some resorts and as an operating item at other resorts. We believe
the preferable presentation of these items is as an element of
operating income. Prior period statements have not been reclassified
as such transactions were not material in the prior periods. Until
2003, demolition costs were typically capitalized as part of new
construction. We began expensing demolition costs on major
construction projects as incurred on January 1, 2003, and are
accounting for this change in policy prospectively. Demolition costs
were not material in prior periods. Demolition costs in 2003 relate
to preparation for the Bellagio standard room remodel, Bellagio
expansion and new theatre at MGM Grand Las Vegas. Impairments of
assets to be disposed of in 2003 consisted primarily of assets related
to the former EFX! Show and restaurants closed during 2003 at MGM
Grand Las Vegas.

In 2002, Tropical Storm Isidore caused property damage at Beau
Rivage totaling $8 million, including clean-up costs. The amount of
the write-down for damaged assets was determined based on the net book
value of the assets and engineering estimates. In connection with the
revised development agreement in Detroit, we wrote off $5 million,
which was the net book value of previously incurred development costs
associated with the riverfront permanent casino site ($9 million),
offset by previously accrued obligations no longer required under the
revised development agreement ($4 million).

The 2001 write-down of the Atlantic City Boardwalk land resulted
from a reassessment of the fair value of the land subsequent to the
September 11 attacks. The revised carrying value was based on
comparable sales data adjusted for the impact of legislation
authorizing large-scale gaming in the state of New York, which we
believe had a negative impact on real estate values on the Atlantic
City Boardwalk. The remaining 2001 charge of $15 million relates to
several assets abandoned during the quarter in response to the
September 11 attacks, primarily in-progress construction projects
which we terminated after the attacks.

Interest cost decreased in 2002 from 2001 due to lower debt

from $79 million in 2001 to $62 million in 2002, due to the lower debt
balances and interest rates described above, and due to our October
2002 decision to suspend development of our wholly-owned Atlantic City
development project.

Capitalized
interest decreased in 2003 due to the suspension of development
in Atlantic City in late 2002 and the mid-2003 cessation of interest
capitalization on the Company’s investment in Borgata, which opened on
July 3, 2003.

The effective income tax rate in 2003 was lower than in 2002 due
to the reversal of certain tax reserves as a result of completion of
IRS audits for certain prior tax years and expiration of the IRS
statutes of limitations on other years. Excluding the reversal, our
effective income tax rate was 36.7% in both periods. The decrease in
our effective income tax rate in 2002 was the result of higher income
before taxes. The items causing a difference between the Federal
statutory rate and our effective income tax rate, primarily
non-deductible expenses and state and foreign income taxes, have not
varied significantly between years.

In 2003, taxes paid increased from prior years, primarily due to
payments made to settle IRS audits of prior years. Excluding these
payments, our taxes paid have generally been significantly lower than
our income tax provision. This is primarily due to accelerated tax
depreciation and the utilization of tax credits, primarily for
alternative minimum tax paid in prior years. We utilized the last of
these credits in 2003, and we expect that our cash paid for taxes will
increase accordingly in 2004.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

Cash Flows – Summary

Our cash flows consisted of the following:

Cash Flows – Operating Activities

Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our
operating income, excluding non-cash charges, since our business is
primarily cash-based. Cash flow from operations in 2003 decreased
from 2002, resulting from the decrease in operating income and higher
cash paid for taxes. In 2002, cash flow from operations increased,
but not to the same extent as operating income, primarily because
operating income in 2001 included significant non-cash charges.

At December 31, 2003 and 2002, we held cash and cash equivalents
of $178 million and $211 million. We require a certain amount of cash
on hand to operate our resorts. Beyond our cash on hand, we utilize a
company-wide cash management system to minimize the amount of cash
held in banks. Funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily
into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or
are used to repay borrowings under our bank credit facilities.



Cash Flows – Investing Activities

2003 capital expenditures were significantly higher than 2002,
due largely to major projects at our existing resorts. These projects
included:

•

The theatre for

Zumanity

at New York-New York, started
in 2002 and completed in 2003;

•

The theatre at MGM Grand Las Vegas for a new show by
Cirque du Soleil, started in 2003 with an expected mid-2004
completion;

•

The Bellagio standard room remodel, started in 2003
and to be completed in early 2004; and

•

The Bellagio expansion, started in 2003 and expected
to be completed in late 2004. The Bellagio expansion consists
of a new 928-room tower, along with expanded retail,
convention, spa and food and beverage facilities. The project
budget is approximately $375 million. The project is designed
to complement the existing, newly remodeled standard rooms,
and cause minimal business interruption during construction.

Expenditures on these four projects totaled approximately $275
million (including capitalized interest). Costs related to
implementing new slot technology, including IGT’s EZ-Pay

™

system,
Players Club and other slot technology totaled approximately $42
million. Remaining expenditures were for general property
improvements, which amounts were consistent with prior year
expenditures.

Capital expenditures in 2002 were not significantly different
than 2001. 2002 expenditures included general property improvements
at our resorts, such as room remodel projects at The Mirage and Golden
Nugget-Las Vegas, new restaurant and nightclub development at several
of our resorts, and various other remodeling projects. Other capital
expenditures included costs for new slot technology, as well as
pre-construction activities, including capitalized interest, in
Atlantic City.

A large portion of the 2001 capital expenditures related to
general property improvements at our resorts, such as the ongoing room
refurbishment program at The Mirage and restaurant and entertainment
enhancements at MGM Grand Las Vegas and New York-New York. Other
capital expenditures included the construction of the Primm Center at
the Primm Valley Resorts, the completion of the Mirage Events Center,
the acquisition of the building housing MGM Grand Detroit, the
acquisition of a new corporate aircraft and costs, including
capitalized interest, associated with ongoing development projects.

Investments in unconsolidated affiliates primarily represent
required contributions to Borgata. Through December 31, 2003, we had
made $133 million of our required $136 million in cash contributions.
In 2002, we also contributed $44 million to Monte Carlo in connection
with the joint venture’s retirement of the final $87 million of its
outstanding debt.

Cash Flows – Financing Activities

In 2003, we issued $600 million of 6% Senior Notes, due 2009 and
repaid a net $285 million on our bank credit facilities. The net
proceeds of these financing activities were used to supplement
operating cash flows fund capital expenditures and share repurchases.
In 2002 and 2001, we utilized our operating cash flow to reduce
outstanding indebtedness by $270 million and $420 million, while still
funding significant capital expenditures and share repurchases.

Our share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase
programs approved by our Board of Directors and publicly announced.
Our share repurchase activity was as follows:

Principal Debt Arrangements

Our long-term debt consists of publicly held senior and
subordinated notes and bank credit facilities. We pay fixed rates of
interest ranging from 6% to 9.75% on the senior and subordinated
notes. We pay variable interest based on LIBOR on the bank credit
facilities. We amended our bank credit facilities in November 2003,
and our current senior credit facility is a $2.5 billion, five-year
facility with a syndicate of banks led by Bank of America, N.A. Our
senior credit facility consists of a $1.5 billion revolving credit
facility due November 2008 and a $1.0 billion term loan that will be
paid down 20% over the final three years of the loan, with the
remainder due November 2008. Our previous bank credit facilities
consisted of a $2.0 billion credit facility maturing in May 2005 and a
$525 million revolving credit facility due April 2, 2004.

As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately $885 million of
available liquidity under our bank credit facilities, and our next
maturity of public debt is $500 million due in February 2005. We can
raise additional capital through our shelf registration statement,
declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2000,
which originally allowed us to issue up to a total of $2.75 billion of
debt and equity securities from time to time in public offerings. At
December 31, 2003, the shelf registration statement has $190 million
in remaining capacity for the issuance of future debt or equity
securities. Any future public offering of securities under the shelf
registration statement will only be made by means of a prospectus
supplement.

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity

In January 2004, we completed the sale of the Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries, resulting in net cash proceeds to us of $213 million.
The proceeds were used to repay borrowings under our senior credit
facility. In February 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell our
subsidiaries that own and operate MGM Grand Australia for A$195
(approximately $150 million), subject to certain working capital
adjustments. We expect this transaction to be completed by the third
quarter of 2004, subject to customary sales conditions and regulatory
approvals.

In September 2003, Standard & Poor’s Rating Service lowered its
rating on us, including our corporate credit rating, to one level
below investment grade, to ‘BB+’ from ‘BBB-’. In January 2002,
Moody’s Investment Services lowered its rating on our senior notes to
one level below investment grade (Bal). As a result of the Moody’s
downgrade, substantially all of our assets other than assets of our
foreign subsidiaries and certain assets in use at MGM Grand Detroit
are pledged as collateral for our senior notes, excluding subordinated
notes, and our bank credit facilities. We do not believe the
downgrades have had, or will have, a significant effect on our
liquidity or our ability to secure short-term or long-term financing.
Subsequent to the downgrades, we successfully amended our bank credit
facilities and issued the $600 million senior notes, both on pricing
and other terms which were favorable and consistent with similar
arrangements before the downgrades.

Future Developments

Detroit, Michigan.

MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, in which we hold a
controlling interest, has operated an interim casino facility in
Detroit, Michigan since July 1999. In August 2002, the Detroit City
Council approved revised development agreements with us and two other
developers. The revised development agreement released us and the
City from certain of the obligations under the original agreement and
significantly changed other provisions of the original agreement. We
are currently in the process of obtaining land and developing plans
for the permanent facility, and currently expect the project to cost
approximately $575 million (including land, capitalized interest and
preopening expenses, but excluding approximately $115 million of
payments to the City under the revised development agreement). The
design, budget and schedule of the permanent facility are not
finalized, and the ultimate timing, cost and scope of the facility are
subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects.

The ability to construct the permanent casino facility is
currently subject to resolution of the Lac Vieux litigation. Pending
resolution of this litigation, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals has
issued an injunction prohibiting the City and the developers from
commencing construction pending further action of the 6th Circuit
Court. Therefore, we do not know when we will be able to commence
construction of, or complete, the permanent facility.



Atlantic City, New Jersey.

We own approximately 149 acres on
Renaissance Pointe in Atlantic City, New Jersey. We obtained the land
at Renaissance Pointe through an agreement between Mirage and the City
of Atlantic City. In addition, Borgata occupies 29 acres at
Renaissance Pointe, including 27 acres it owns and two acres we lease
to Borgata. Of the remaining land, approximately 95 acres are
suitable for development, and a portion of these acres consists of
common roads, landscaping and master plan improvements which we
designed and developed as required by our agreement with Boyd.

In October 2002, we announced the temporary suspension of our
development activities on our wholly-owned project on the Renaissance
Pointe land in Atlantic City. We must apply for and receive numerous
governmental permits and satisfy other conditions before construction
of a new resort on the Renaissance Pointe site could begin. No
assurance can be given that we will develop a casino resort in New
Jersey, or its ultimate schedule, size, configuration or cost if we do
develop a casino resort.

Las Vegas, Nevada.

We own an approximately 50-acre site for
future development, with over 1,200 feet of frontage on the Las Vegas
Strip, between Bellagio and Monte Carlo, part of which is occupied by
our Boardwalk. The design, timing and cost of any future development
on the site will depend on several factors, including the market’s
ability to absorb new development on the Las Vegas Strip, competition
from gaming outside of Nevada and the ultimate size and scope of the
project, among other factors.

In 2002, we entered into an agreement with Turnberry Associates
to develop luxury condominium towers at MGM Grand Las Vegas. We will
initially contribute land and up to $3 million to the project for a
50% investment. Turnberry Associates will contribute $9 million, and
up to an additional $3 million, in cash and will manage the
development and sales process. The venture will obtain construction
financing for the remainder of the expected $175 million to $200
million cost of the first tower once sufficient pre-sales have
occurred to obtain financing. We will have the opportunity to rent the
condominiums to third parties on behalf of owners who elect to have us
do so. Depending on market acceptance of the initial tower, we and
Turnberry Associates may develop, on similar terms, up to an
additional five condominium towers.

United Kingdom.

In anticipation of reforms to gambling
legislation currently being considered by the British government, we
have made several strategic agreements in the United Kingdom.

In May 2003, we purchased a 25% interest in Metro Casinos
Limited, a company which is developing a new casino in Bristol. Metro
Casinos Limited is a subsidiary of R J Bown (Holdings) Ltd, the owner
of the Westcliff Casino, one of the largest United Kingdom provincial
casinos. The Bristol facility is expected to open by March 2004. Our
purchase of this interest received regulatory approval from the Gaming
Board for Great Britain in November 2003.

In October 2003, we entered into an agreement with Earls Court
and Olympia Group, which operates large exhibition and trade show
facilities in London, to form a jointly owned company which would
develop a large entertainment and gaming facility, which we would
operate in space leased from Earls Court and Olympia, to complement
the existing Olympia facilities. We made a deposit of £2 million ($3
million based on exchange rates at December 31, 2003), which is
refundable if proposed gaming law reforms are not implemented by
December 2005. Otherwise, the deposit will be applied to the first
year’s rent on a lease between the new company and Earls Court and
Olympia. We would make a nominal equity investment and would provide
a loan for half of the estimated £130 million ($232 million based on
exchange rates at December 31, 2003) of development costs. The
agreement is subject to implementation of proposed gaming law reforms
and a tax structure acceptable to us, and obtaining required planning
and other approvals. We would own 82.5% of the entity.

In November 2003, we entered into an agreement with Newcastle
United PLC to create a 50-50 joint venture which would build a major
new mixed-use development, including casino development, on a site
adjacent to Newcastle’s football stadium. Newcastle United PLC will
contribute the land to the joint venture, and we will make an equity
investment of £5 million ($9 million based on exchange rates at
December 31, 2003), which is refundable if certain conditions have not
been met by January 2008. We would develop and operate the complex,
as well as own the casino development in leased premises within the
complex. The complex is expected to be financed through
project-specific borrowings. The agreement is subject to
implementation of proposed gaming law reforms and a tax structure
acceptable to us, and obtaining required planning and other approvals.

In February 2004, we announced an agreement in principle with The
British Land Company PLC whereby we would operate a casino in leased
premises within a newly developed leisure and entertainment complex
adjacent to the Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield UK. The
agreement is subject to implementation of proposed gaming law reforms
and a tax structure acceptable to us, and obtaining required planning
and other approvals.



Wembley plc.

In January 2004, we reached an agreement with
Wembley plc (“Wembley”) on the terms of a cash acquisition by us of
Wembley. We have offered Wembley’s shareholders 750 pence per share,
valuing Wembley at $490 million as of the date of the offer. Wembley
has no material indebtedness. Wembley’s operations consist of
greyhound racing and video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) at its Lincoln
Park facility in Rhode Island, three greyhound tracks and one horse
racing track in Colorado, and six greyhound tracks in the United
Kingdom. A member of the Wembley plc group, Lincoln Park, Inc., and
two executive of the Wembley plc group are subject to indictment in
Rhode Island. We will purchase Wembley free and clear of the
indictment and any related liabilities. Under an agreement with the
United States Department of Justice, the indictment will proceed
against a new entity funded by Wembley which we will not be acquiring.
We expect the transaction to close by the third quarter of 2004,
subject to requisite court and shareholder approval, the completion of
the Lincoln Park reorganization and receipt of necessary regulatory
approvals.

New York Racing Association.

We have an understanding with the
New York Racing Association (“NYRA”) to manage VLTs at NYRA’s Aqueduct
horseracing facility in metropolitan New York. We would assist in the
development of the facility, including providing project financing,
and would manage the facility for a fee. The project is anticipated
to cost $135 million. Work was halted on the VLT facility in August
2003 pending the outcome of an investigation of certain aspects of
NYRA’s operations by Federal prosecutors. In December 2003, NYRA
reached agreement with the Justice Department whereby NYRA was
indicted with prosecution deferred. NYRA agreed to pay a fine and the
indictment will be dismissed with prejudice upon NYRA implementing
certain reforms and otherwise complying with the terms of the
agreement. Our participation is subject to a definitive agreement,
regulatory approvals and certain legislative changes by the State of
New York.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of
investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which currently consist of
our investments in Monte Carlo and Borgata. We have not entered into
any transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged in
any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate
swaps. Our joint venture and unconsolidated affiliate investments
allow us to realize the benefits of owning a full-scale resort in a
manner that minimizes our initial investment. We have not guaranteed
financing obtained by the ventures, nor are there any other provisions
of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to
which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the
resort.

At December 31, 2003, we had outstanding letters of credit
totaling $52 million, of which $50 million support the bonds issued by
the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit. These
bonds are recorded as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets.
This obligation was undertaken to secure our right to develop a
permanent casino in Detroit.

Includes our obligation to support $50 million of bonds issued
by the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit as
part of our development agreement with the City. The bonds mature
in 2009. Also includes the estimated payments of obligations under
our deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement
plans, based on balances as of December 31, 2003 and assumptions of
retirement based on plan provisions.

(2)

Our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum
contractual payments to Cirque du Soleil, which performs shows at
several of our resorts. We are generally contractually committed
for a period of 12 months based on our ability to exercise certain
termination rights; however, we expect these shows to continue for
longer periods. Commitments for 2004 also include our obligations
to complete the theatre construction and contribute to the show
production costs for the new Cirque du Soleil show at MGM Grand Las
Vegas.

(3)

The amount for 2004 includes approximately $57 million of
open purchase orders. Other commitments are for various
contracts, including maintenance and other service agreements and
advertising commitments.



Other significant operating uses of cash in 2004 include interest
and tax payments. Our cash payments for interest ranged from $266
million to $318 million over the past three years, and we would expect
similar levels of cash payments for interest in 2004. As discussed
earlier, our cash paid for income taxes in 2004 will likely increase
over 2003. Other significant investing uses of cash flow in 2004
include uncommitted capital expenditures, expected to be approximately
$300 million exclusive of any spending on a permanent casino in
Detroit, and the proposed Wembley acquisition, valued at $490 million
on the date we made the offer.

We plan to fund our contractual obligations and other estimated
spending through a combination of operating cash flow, proceeds from
known or expected sales of businesses and available borrowings under
our senior credit facility. We have generated over $700 million in
operating cash flow in each of the past three years, which included
deductions for interest payments, tax payments and certain
contractually committed payments reflected in the above table,
including operating leases, employment agreements and entertainment
agreements. We expect to generate a similar level of operating cash
flow in 2004. Assuming operating cash flow is used to fund the
remaining contractual commitments of approximately $500 million
to $600 million, we
would have at least $100 million of operating cash flow available for
other planned expenditures.

Other sources of cash include the net proceeds of $213 million
received in January 2004 upon closing the sale of the Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries, the net proceeds of $150 million from the sale of MGM
Grand Australia, if the sale closes as expected by the third quarter
of 2004, and the $885 million of available borrowings under our senior
credit facility.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations
and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated
financial statements. To prepare our consolidated financial
statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America, we must make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated
financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and
assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical
accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions
could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial
position and, generally to a lesser extent, cash flows. Senior
management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have
reviewed the disclosures included herein about our critical accounting
estimates, and have reviewed the processes to determine those
estimates.

Allowance for Doubtful Casino Accounts Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games
volume at Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage. Our other
facilities do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although
we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well, with the
exception of MGM Grand Australia, where Northern Territory legislation
prohibits marker play.

We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and
aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay
their marker balances timely. These collection efforts are similar to
those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue
customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency
notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and
civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable
instruments in the United States. At December 31, 2003 and 2002,
approximately 53% and 57%, respectively, of our casino accounts
receivable was owed by customers from the United States. Markers are
not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the
United States assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy
judgments entered in the United States. A significant portion of our
casino accounts receivable is owed by casino customers from the Far
East. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, approximately 30% and 28%,
respectively, of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers
from the Far East.

We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino
accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision for
doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the allowance for
doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful
casino accounts. At resorts where marker play is not significant, the
allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve
percentages to aged account balances. At resorts where marker play is
significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account
balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the
collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified
dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s
financial condition, collection history and any other known
information. We also monitor regional and global economic conditions
and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are adequate.



The collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of
factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic
conditions in the customers’ home countries. Because individual
customer account balances can be significant, the allowance and the
provision can change significantly between periods, as information
about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s
economy occur.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino
receivables:

The allowance percentage increased in 2001 as a result of the
impact of the September 11 attacks on our customers’ traveling
patterns and the global economy, as well as the impacts of declines in
the United States stock markets through 2000 and 2001. During 2002,
the United States stock markets continued to decline, but we
experienced better than anticipated receivable collections on certain
customer accounts during 2002, which resulted in a reversal of
previously recorded bad debt provision in the third quarter of 2002.

In the fourth quarter of 2003 we recorded an additional reversal
of bad debt provision as we again experienced better than expected
collections. The current strength in the United States economy and
recent United States stock market gains have also caused us to
positively adjust our outlook on collectibility of domestic accounts
receivable. The above economic and collection trends are reflected in
the improved quality of our receivables statistics in the above table.
Our reserve percentage at December 31, 2003 is lower than it has been
since the events of September 11, 2001, though still higher than the
periods preceding September 11, 2001.

At December 31, 2003, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance
for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable
would change net income by $2 million, or $0.01 per share.

Fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and
repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor
appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred.
Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis
over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We account for
construction projects in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 67, “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental
Operations of Real Estate Projects”. When we construct assets, we
capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to
architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our
design and construction subsidiary, MGM MIRAGE Design Group.

We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for
capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a
maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. When
constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing
assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a
matter of judgment. Our depreciation expense is highly dependent on
the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives. We
determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with
similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of
the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the
estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change
prospectively.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost” (“SFAS 34”), interest cost
associated with major development and construction projects is
capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically
capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the
weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings, since we
typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development
project. Capitalization of interest starts when construction
activities, as defined in SFAS 34, begin and ceases when construction
is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for
more than a brief period.



Whether we capitalize interest on a project depends in part on
management’s actions. In January 2001, we announced that our
near-term development focus would be on the Atlantic City market. As
a result, we suspended the capitalization of interest on our Las Vegas
Strip project until the development process for that project is
further advanced. Interest capitalized on this project was $3 million
in 2001. In October 2002, we announced the suspension of development
activities on our wholly-owned project on the Renaissance Pointe land
in Atlantic City. In connection with that announcement, we stopped
capitalizing interest associated with the project. Interest
capitalized on this project for the years ended December 31, 2001 and
2002 was $60 million and $41 million, respectively.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived
assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or
Disposal of Long-Lived Assets” (“SFAS 144”). For assets to be
disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or
fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on
comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a discounted cash flow
model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment
whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the
estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to
the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows
exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the
undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an
impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically
measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still
under development, future cash flows include remaining construction
costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be
disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating
expenses.

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in
measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must
determine the usage of the asset. To the extent management decides
that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may
be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be
grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets.
Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and
actual results may differ materially from our estimates.

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to
determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate
a potential impairment. We estimate future cash flows using our
internal budgets. When appropriate, we discount future cash flows
using our weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard
capital asset pricing model. Whenever an impairment loss is recorded,
or a test for impairment is made, we discuss the facts and
circumstances with the audit committee.

See “Results of Operations” for discussion of write-downs and
impairments recorded in 2001, 2002 and 2003. In October 2002, we
announced the temporary suspension of our development activities on
our wholly-owned project on the Renaissance Pointe land in Atlantic
City. In connection therewith, we reviewed the land for potential
impairment, and determined no impairment was indicated. In December
2002, in connection with our agreement with Turnberry Associates
whereby we are required to contribute land to the venture, we reviewed
the land for potential impairment, and determined no impairment was
indicated. In June 2003, we entered into an agreement to sell the
Golden Nugget Subsidiaries. The fair value less costs to sell exceeds
the carrying value, therefore no impairment was indicated. In
February 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell MGM Grand
Australia. The fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying
value, therefore no impairment was indicated.

Other than the above items, we are not aware of events or
circumstances that would cause us to review any material long-lived
assets for impairment.

Income taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States, and in
several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We
account for income taxes according to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS
109”). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net
of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss carryforwards
and certain temporary differences. The standard requires recognition
of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit
is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.



At December 31, 2003, we had $90 million of deferred tax assets
and $1.8 billion of deferred tax liabilities. Except for certain New
Jersey state net operating losses and certain other New Jersey state
deferred tax assets, we believe that it is more likely than not that
our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future
reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future
projected taxable income. The valuation allowance at December 31,
2003 related to the New Jersey deferred tax assets was $10 million.

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. We regularly
assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the
adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax
liabilities. To determine necessary reserves, we must make
assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing
authorities, partially based on past experiences. Our estimate of the
potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental,
and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and
foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters.

When actual results of tax examinations differ from our
estimates, we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in
the period in which the examination issues are settled. In December
2002, we settled the IRS audit of the Company’s 1995 and 1996 tax
returns, which did not result in a material impact on our results of
operations or financial position. During 2003, we filed amended
returns for tax years subsequent to 1996 to reflect the impact of the
IRS audits of the 1993 through 1996 tax years on those subsequent
years. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the statutes of limitations
expired for the 1997 through 1999 tax years, resulting in a reduction
of our tax reserves of $13 million and a corresponding reduction in
our provision for income taxes. The tax returns for years after 1999
are subject to possible future examination.

A portion of our tax reserves was assumed in the Mirage
Acquisition. The IRS audit of the tax returns of Mirage through the
merger date was settled in August 2003, resulting in a payment to the
IRS of $45 million, including interest. These matters had been
previously reserved for, so the settlement had no impact on our income
tax provision or our results of operations. Any future adjustments to
the acquired Mirage tax reserves will be recorded as an adjustment to
goodwill.

Accounting Principles Adopted in 2003

Classification of Gains and Losses as Extraordinary Items

In April 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 145, “Rescission of FASB Statements 4, 44, and 64,
Amendment of FASB Statement 13, and Technical Corrections as of April
2002” (“SFAS 145”). The key provision of SFAS 145 that affects us
rescinds the existing rule that all gains or losses from the
extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items.
Instead, such gains and losses must be analyzed to determine if they
meet the criteria for extraordinary item classification based on the
event being both unusual and infrequent.

We adopted SFAS 145 beginning January 1, 2003. Prior period
losses were analyzed to determine if they met the criteria to be
classified as extraordinary items. Our prior period losses were
reclassified as an element of income from continuing operations.

Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

In June 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or
Disposal Activities” (“SFAS 146”). SFAS 146 requires companies to
recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they
are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or
disposal plan, as previously required under EITF Issue 94-3. Examples
of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and
certain employee severance costs associated with a restructuring,
discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal
activity. SFAS 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal
activities initiated after December 31, 2002.

We adopted SFAS 146 beginning January 1, 2003. The adoption of
this statement did not have a material impact on our results of
operations or financial position. The time between our commitment to
an exit or disposal plan and when costs are actually incurred is
typically short.



Guarantee Obligations

In November 2002, the FASB issued its Interpretation No. 45,
“Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees,
Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others” (“FIN 45”).
FIN 45 requires that future guarantee obligations be recognized as
liabilities at inception of the guarantee contract. It also increases
the disclosures required for current and future guarantee obligations.

We have included the disclosures required by FIN 45 in the
accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements. We adopted
the initial recognition provisions of FIN 45 beginning January 1,
2003. The adoption of this interpretation did not have a material
impact on our results of operation or financial position.

Stock-based Compensation

In December 2002, the FASB issued Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS 148”). SFAS 148
increases the disclosure requirements for companies which do not
voluntarily adopt the fair value based accounting for employee stock
compensation prescribed in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” on a retroactive
basis. SFAS 148 also requires companies to present the pro forma
disclosures in interim financial statements.

We have included the annual disclosures required by SFAS 148 in
the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements, and began
presenting the required interim disclosures in 2003.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

There are no accounting standards issued before December 31, 2003
but effective after December 31, 2003 which are expected to have a
material impact on our financial reporting.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in
market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency
exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market
risk is interest rate risk associated with our long-term debt. We
attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the
mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings
under our bank credit facilities and commercial paper program.

In the third quarter of 2003, we entered into three interest rate
swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which effectively
convert $400 million of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt.
Under the terms of these agreements, we make payments based on
specified spreads over six-month LIBOR, and receive payments equal to
the interest payments due on the fixed rate debt. The interest rate
swap agreements qualify for the “shortcut method” allowed under
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, which allows an
assumption of no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship. As
such, there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair
value of the hedging instruments.

The following table provides information about our interest rate
swaps as of December 31, 2003:

* Interest rates are determined in arrears. These
rates have been estimated based on implied forward
rates in the yield curve.

As of December 31, 2003, after giving effect to the interest rate
swaps discussed above, long-term fixed rate borrowings represented
approximately 64% of our total borrowings. Assuming a 100 basis-point
change in LIBOR, our annual interest cost would change by
approximately $20 million.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM MIRAGE

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
MGM MIRAGE (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”)
as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of
the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits
also included the financial statement schedule of Valuation and
Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2). These financial
statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility
of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule
based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.
An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MGM MIRAGE
and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also,
in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in
relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set
forth therein.

MGM MIRAGE AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION

MGM
MIRAGE (the “Company”), formerly MGM Grand, Inc., is a Delaware corporation,
incorporated on January 29, 1986. As of December 31, 2003
approximately 57% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common
stock were owned by Tracinda Corporation, a Nevada corporation wholly
owned by Kirk Kerkorian. MGM MIRAGE acts largely as a holding company
and, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, operates hotel, casino and
entertainment resorts.

The Company owns and operates the following hotel, casino and
entertainment resorts on the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas, Nevada:
Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, The Mirage, Treasure Island (“TI”), New
York-New York and the Boardwalk Hotel and Casino. The Company owns a
50% interest in the joint venture that owns and operates the Monte
Carlo Resort & Casino, also located on the Las Vegas Strip.

The Company owns three resorts in Primm, Nevada at the
California/Nevada state line – Whiskey Pete’s, Buffalo Bill’s and the
Primm Valley Resort – as well as two championship golf courses located
near the resorts. The Company also owns Shadow Creek, an exclusive
world-class golf course located approximately ten miles north of its
Las Vegas Strip resorts. Until January 2004, the Company owned and
operated the Golden Nugget Las Vegas in downtown Las Vegas and the
Golden Nugget Laughlin in Laughlin, Nevada (the “Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries”). See Note 3 for information regarding the sale of
these resorts.

The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, MGM Grand
Detroit, Inc., and its local partners formed MGM Grand Detroit, LLC,
to develop a hotel, casino and entertainment complex in Detroit,
Michigan. MGM Grand Detroit, LLC operates a casino in an interim
facility in downtown Detroit. See Note 10 for discussion of the
revised development agreement with the City of Detroit and plans for a
permanent casino resort.

The Company owns and operates Beau Rivage, a beachfront resort
located in Biloxi, Mississippi, and MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in
Darwin, Australia – see Note 18 for information regarding the proposed
sale of this resort. The Company also owns a 50% interest in a
limited liability company that owns Borgata, a casino resort at
Renaissance Pointe, located in the Marina area of Atlantic City, New
Jersey. Boyd Gaming Corporation owns the other 50% of Borgata and
also operates the resort. Borgata opened in July 2003. The Company
owns approximately 95 developable acres adjacent to Borgata, a portion
of which consists of common roads, landscaping and master plan
improvements which the Company designed and developed as required
under the agreement with Boyd.

In the second quarter of 2002, the Company received proceeds of
$11 million upon termination of management agreements covering four
casinos in the Republic of South Africa. Prior to the termination, the
Company managed three permanent casinos and one interim casino and
received management fees from its partner, Tsogo Sun Gaming &
Entertainment. The termination fee was recorded as part of
entertainment, retail and other revenues in the accompanying
consolidated statements of income.

Until June 30, 2003, the Company operated PLAYMGMMIRAGE.com, the
Company’s online gaming website based in the Isle of Man.
PLAYMGMMIRAGE.com became operational on September 26, 2002. It was
initially not actively marketed, and was in the start-up phase through
January 31, 2003. The Company ceased operations of the website as of
June 30, 2003. See Note 3 for further information.

The Company is actively seeking future development opportunities
in the United Kingdom. In May 2003, the Company acquired a 25%
interest in Metro Casinos Limited, a United Kingdom gaming company
which is developing a new casino in Bristol. See Note 10 for
discussion of other potential developments in the United Kingdom.



NOTE 2 — SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Principles of consolidation.

The consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are 50% or less owned
are accounted for under the equity method. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in
consolidation. The Company’s operations are primarily in one segment
– operation of casino resorts. Other operations, and foreign
operations, are not material.

Management’s use of estimates.

The consolidated financial
statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Those principles
require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents include
investments and interest bearing instruments with maturities of three
months or less at the date of acquisition. Such investments are
carried at cost which approximates market value.

Accounts receivable and credit risk.

Financial instruments that
potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of casino accounts receivable. The Company issues
markers to approved casino customers following background checks and
investigations of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2003, a
substantial portion of the Company’s receivables were due from
customers residing in foreign countries. Business or economic
conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect
the collectibility of such receivables.

Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are
typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost.
Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be
uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are
recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts
is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their carrying
amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated
based on specific review of customer accounts as well as historical
collection experience and current economic and business conditions.
Management believes that as of December 31, 2003, no significant
concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not
already been recorded.

Inventories.

Inventories consist of food and beverage, retail
merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of
cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method.

Property and equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at
cost. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are
included in the determination of income. Property and equipment are
generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a
straight-line basis:

Buildings

40 years

Building improvements

15 to 40 years

Land improvements

15 to 40 years

Equipment, furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements

5 to 20 years

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived
assets for impairment in accordance with the Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144,
“Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”
(“SFAS 144”). For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset to
be sold at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs
of disposal. Fair value for assets to be disposed of is
estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers, or a
discounted cash flow model.

For assets to be held and used, we review fixed assets for
impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. If an indicator
of impairment exists, we compare the estimated future cash flows of
the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the
asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no
impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed
the carrying value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value
compared to carrying value, with fair value typically based on a
discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development,
future cash flows include remaining construction costs.



For a discussion of recognized impairment losses, see Note 14.
In October 2002, the Company announced the suspension of development
activities on its wholly-owned project on the Renaissance Pointe land
in Atlantic City. In connection therewith, the Company reviewed the
land for potential impairment, and determined that no impairment was
indicated. In December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement
with Turnberry Associates to form a venture which will construct
condominium residences behind MGM Grand Las Vegas. As part of the
agreement, the Company will contribute land to the venture. The
Company reviewed the land for potential impairment, and determined no
impairment was indicated. In June 2003, the Company entered into an
agreement to sell the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries. The fair value less
costs to sell exceeded the carrying value, therefore no impairment was
indicated.

Capitalized interest.

The interest cost associated with major
development and construction projects is capitalized and included in
the cost of the project. When no debt is incurred specifically for a
project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project
using the weighted-average cost of the Company’s outstanding
borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is
substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more
than a brief period.

Goodwill and other intangible assets

. The Company adopted
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets” (“SFAS 142”), on January 1, 2002. The
statement provides that goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
assets are no longer amortized, but are instead reviewed for
impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain
circumstances.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002 goodwill and intangible assets
consisted of the following:

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market
value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill
related to the Mirage acquisition was assigned to Bellagio, The
Mirage, TI and Golden Nugget Las Vegas. Other goodwill relates
to the Company’s 2003 acquisition for $9 million of majority interests in the
entities that operate the nightclubs Light and Caramel, located in
Bellagio, and Mist, located in TI. Changes in the recorded balances
of goodwill are as follows:

The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist
primarily of development rights in Detroit (see Note 10) and
trademarks. The Company’s finite–lived intangible assets consist
primarily of lease acquisition costs, amortized over the life of the
related leases, and certain license rights with contractually limited
terms, amortized over their contractual life.



The Company completed the necessary transition impairment reviews
for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2002, and no
impairments were indicated. The Company performs its annual impairment
test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth
quarter of each fiscal year. No impairments were indicated as a
result of the annual impairment reviews for goodwill and
indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2003 or 2002. Amortization of
goodwill and indefinite–lived intangible assets totaled $3 million for
the year ended 2001. Had SFAS 142 been in effect, the Company’s
results would have been as follows:

Revenue recognition and promotional allowances.

Casino revenue
is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and losses, with
liabilities recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming
play occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the customers’
possession (“outstanding chip liability”). Hotel, food and beverage,
entertainment and other operating revenues are recognized as services
are performed. Advance deposits on rooms and advance ticket sales are
recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided to the
customer.

Revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives in
accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on
Issue 01-9, “Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a
Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendor ´s Products).” The
consensus in EITF 01-9 requires that sales incentives be recorded as a
reduction of revenue and that points earned in point-loyalty programs,
such as our Players Club loyalty program, must be recorded as a
reduction of revenue. The Company recognizes incentives related to
casino play and points earned in Players Club as a direct reduction of
casino revenue.

Existing industry practice related to non-gaming revenues already
complied with EITF 01-9. The retail value of accommodations, food and
beverage, and other services furnished to guests without charge is
included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances.
The estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is
primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Advertising.

The Company expenses advertising costs the first
time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense, which is
generally included in general and administrative expenses, was $56
million, $54 million and $51 million for 2003, 2002 and 2001,
respectively.

Corporate expense.

Corporate expense represents unallocated
payroll and aircraft costs, professional fees and various other
expenses not directly related to the Company’s casino resort
operations. In addition, corporate expense includes the costs
associated with the Company’s evaluation and pursuit of new business
opportunities, which are expensed as incurred until development of a
specific project has become probable.

Preopening and start-up expenses.

The Company accounts for costs
incurred during the preopening and start-up phases of operations in
accordance with Statement of Position 98-5, “Reporting on the Costs of
Start-up Activities”. Preopening and start-up costs, including
organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as
preopening and start-up expenses include payroll, outside services,
advertising, and other expenses related to new or start-up operations
and customer initiatives.



Income per share of common stock.

The weighted-average number of
common and common equivalent shares used in the calculation of basic
and diluted earnings per share consisted of the following:

Stock-based compensation.

The Company accounts for stock-based
compensation, including employee stock option plans, in accordance
with Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees” and the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s
Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions involving
Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25”, and
discloses supplemental information in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), as amended by Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation
– Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS 148”). The Company does not incur
compensation expense for employee stock options when the exercise
price is at least 100% of the market value of the Company’s common
stock on the date of grant. For disclosure purposes, employee stock
options are measured at fair value, compensation is assumed to be
amortized over the vesting periods of the options, and pro forma
results are disclosed as if the Company had applied SFAS 123.

The Company has adopted nonqualified stock option plans and
incentive stock option plans which provide for the granting of stock
options to eligible directors, officers and employees. The plans are
administered by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the
Board of Directors. Salaried officers, directors and other key
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to receive
options. The exercise price in each instance is 100% of the fair
market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The
options have 10-year terms and in most cases are exercisable in either
four or five equal annual installments.

In November 2001, the Company offered its employees and members
of its Board of Directors the opportunity to surrender certain stock
options in exchange for the issuance of options equal in number to 90%
of the options surrendered. The replacement options were to be
granted no earlier than 6 months and one day after the options were
surrendered, at an exercise price equal to the market price of the
Company’s common stock on the date the replacement options were
granted. In connection with the November 2001 offer, 5.7 million
options with an average exercise price of $32.57 were surrendered in
December 2001 and 5.2 million replacement options with an exercise
price of $34.15 were granted in June 2002.

As of December 31, 2003, the aggregate number of shares subject
to options available for grant under all of the plans was 2.0 million.
A summary of the status of the Company’s nonqualified stock option
and incentive stock option plans for each of the years ended December
31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is presented below:

Had the Company accounted for these plans under the fair value
method allowed by SFAS 123, the Company’s net income and earnings per
share would have been reduced to recognize the fair value of employee
stock options. The following are required disclosures under SFAS 123
and SFAS 148:

Reported net income includes $5 million and $3 million, net of
tax, of amortization of restricted stock and non-employee stock option
compensation for the years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively. For purposes of computing the pro forma compensation,
the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 3% in 2003,
and 4% in 2002 and 2001; no expected dividend yields for the years
presented; expected lives of 5 years for the years presented; and
expected volatility of 42% in 2003, 50% in 2002 and 40% in 2001. The
estimated weighted average fair value of options granted in 2003, 2002
and 2001 was $10.64, $16.32 and $12.23, respectively.

Currency translation.

The Company accounts for currency
translation in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”. Balance sheet
accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance
sheet date. Income statement accounts are translated at the average
rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation
adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to
other comprehensive income (loss).

Comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income includes net income
and all other non-stockholder changes in equity, or other
comprehensive income. Elements of the Company’s other comprehensive
income are reported in the accompanying consolidated statement of
stockholders’ equity, and the cumulative balance of these elements
consisted of the following:

Reclassifications.

The consolidated financial statements for
prior years reflect certain reclassifications, which have no effect on
previously reported net income, to conform to the current year
presentation. See Note 14 for information on classification of
“Property transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income.



NOTE 3 — DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In June 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the
Golden Nugget Subsidiaries, including substantially all of the assets
and liabilities of those resorts, for approximately $215 million,
subject to certain working capital adjustments. This transaction
closed in January 2004. Also in June 2003, the Company ceased
operations of PLAYMGMMIRAGE.com, its online gaming website (“Online”).

The results of the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries and Online are
classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated
statements of income for all periods presented. Net revenues of
discontinued operations were $231 million, $222 million and $223
million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and
2001. Included in the income (loss) from discontinued operations is
an allocation of interest expense based on the ratio of the net assets
of the discontinued operations to the total consolidated net assets
and debt of the Company. Interest allocated to discontinued
operations was $9 million, $9 million and $11 million for the years
ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Also included
in discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 is a
loss on disposal of Online of $7 million relating primarily to
unrecoverable costs of computer hardware and software. The estimated
fair value less costs to sell the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries exceeds
the carrying value, therefore no impairment was recognized as of
December 31, 2003. Included in the tax benefit from discontinued
operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 is $2 million of
previously unrecognized tax benefits relating to prior year operating
losses of Online.

The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities of the
Golden Nugget Subsidiaries and Online as of December 31, 2003,
included as assets and liabilities held for sale in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheet:

NOTE 6 — INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES

The Company has investments in unconsolidated affiliates
accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method,
carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s share of the investees’
earnings and losses, as well as capital contributions to and
distributions from these companies. Investments in unconsolidated
affiliates consisted of the following:

The Company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates were
recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of the Mirage
Acquisition, which value exceeded the Company’s share of the net
assets of the unconsolidated affiliates by approximately $361 million.
Substantially all of this difference relates to the excess of the
fair value of land owned by the affiliates over its pre-existing
carrying value. The investment balance also includes interest
capitalized on the Borgata investment, which is being amortized over
40 years.

The Company recorded its share of the results of operations of
the unconsolidated affiliates as follows:

Total interest incurred during 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $356
million, $349 million and $418 million, respectively, of which $15
million, $62 million and $79 million, respectively, was capitalized.

On November 24, 2003, the Company entered into the Third Amended
and Restated Loan Agreement providing for bank financing totaling $2.5
billion from a syndicate of banks each led by Bank of America, N.A.
(collectively, the “Senior Credit Facility”). The Senior Credit
Facility consists of (1) a $1.5 billion senior revolving credit
facility which matures on November 24, 2008 (the “$1.5 billion
Revolving Credit Facility”); and (2) a $1.0 billion term loan, which
matures on November 24, 2008 (the “$1.0 billion Term Loan”). The $1.0
billion Term Loan reduces by 20% over the final three years of the
loan. The Senior Credit Facility replaced the previous senior credit
facilities, which were also provided by syndicates of banks each led
by Bank of America, N.A. and, as amended, consisted of a $2.0 billion
senior revolving credit facility and a $525 million senior revolving
credit facility.



Interest on the Senior Credit Facility is based on the bank
reference rate or Eurodollar rate. The Company’s borrowing rate on
the Senior Credit Facility (or previous credit facilities in 2002) was
approximately 2.8% in both 2003 and 2002. Stand-by letters of credit
totaling $52 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2003 under
the Senior Credit Facility.

In September 2003, the Company issued $600 million of 6% Senior
Notes due 2009. The proceeds were used to reduce the amount
outstanding under the Company’s $2.0 billion revolving credit
facility. In August 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized
the repurchase of up to $100 million of the Company’s public debt
securities. Subsequently, the Company repurchased $25 million of the
Company’s $850 Million 8.50% Senior Notes, due 2010. The Company
recorded a loss of $3.2 million related to repurchase premiums and
unamortized debt issue costs.

The Company established a commercial paper program during 2001
that provides for the issuance, on a revolving basis, of up to $500
million of uncollateralized short-term notes. The Company is required
to maintain credit availability under its Senior Credit Facility equal
to the outstanding principal amount of commercial paper borrowings.
No commercial paper borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2003
or 2002.

In September 2002, the Company entered into a $50 million
unsecured revolving line of credit with a bank. The Company is in the
process of amending this line of credit to increase the capacity to
$100 million on terms similar to the Company’s Senior Credit Facility.
In August 2002, the Company terminated its MGM Grand Detroit, LLC
credit facility, originally due in 2003. The early termination
resulted in a loss of $0.5 million for the write-off of unamortized
debt issuance costs.

The Company has a shelf registration statement declared effective
by the Securities and Exchange Commission in May 2000. The shelf
registration statement originally allowed the Company to issue a
total of up to $2.75 billion of debt and equity securities from time
to time in public offerings. As of December 31, 2003, the Company had
remaining capacity under the shelf registration statement of $190
million. Any future public offering of securities under the shelf
registration statement will only be made by means of a prospectus
supplement.

The Company attempts to limit its exposure to interest rate risk
by managing the mix of its long-term fixed rate borrowings and
short-term borrowings under its bank credit facilities and commercial
paper program. In August 2003, the Company entered into three
interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which
effectively convert $400 million of the Company’s fixed rate debt to
floating rate debt. Under the terms of these agreements, the Company
makes payments based on specified spreads over six-month LIBOR, and
receives payments equal to the interest payments due on the fixed rate
debt. The interest rate swap agreements qualify for the “shortcut
method” allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133, which allows an assumption of no ineffectiveness in the hedging
relationship. As such, there is no income statement impact from
changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments. Instead, the
fair value of the instruments is recorded as an asset or liability on
the Company’s balance sheet, with an offsetting adjustment to the
carrying value of the related debt. At December 31, 2003, the fair
value of the interest rate swap agreements was not material.

During 2001 and 2002, the Company entered into several interest
rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which
effectively converted a portion of the Company’s fixed rate debt to
floating rate debt. By the second quarter of 2002, the Company had
terminated these interest rate swap agreements. The Company received
net payments totaling $11 million during 2001 and 2002 upon the
termination of these swap agreements. These amounts have been added to
the carrying value of the related debt obligations and are being
amortized and recorded as a reduction of interest expense over the
remaining life of that debt.

The Company and each of its material subsidiaries, excluding MGM
Grand Detroit, LLC and the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, are
directly liable for or unconditionally guarantee the Senior Credit
Facility, senior notes, senior debentures, and senior subordinated
notes. MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is a guarantor under the Senior Credit
Facility, but only to the extent that the proceeds of borrowings under
such facilities are made available to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC.
Substantially all of the Company’s assets, other than assets of
foreign subsidiaries and certain assets in use at MGM Grand Detroit,
are pledged as collateral for the Company’s senior notes, excluding
subordinated notes, and the Company’s bank credit facilities.



The Company’s long-term debt obligations contain certain
customary covenants. The Company’s Senior Credit Facility contains
covenants that require the Company to maintain certain financial
ratios. At December 31, 2003, the Company was required to maintain a
maximum leverage ratio (average debt to EBITDA, as defined) of 5.5:1,
which decreases periodically to 4.75:1 by December 2007. The Company
must also maintain a minimum coverage ratio (EBITDA to interest
charges, as defined) of 2.75:1. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company’s leverage and interest coverage ratios were 4.6 and 3.6,
respectively.

Maturities of the Company’s long-term debt as of December 31,
2003 are as follows:

The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at
December 31, 2003 was approximately $6.0 billion, versus its book
value of $5.6 billion. At December 31, 2002, the estimated fair value
of the Company’s long-term debt was approximately $5.6 billion, versus
its book value of $5.2 billion. The estimated fair value of the
Company’s public debt securities was based on quoted market prices on
or about December 31, 2003 and 2002. The estimated fair value of the
Company’s outstanding credit facility borrowings was assumed to
approximate book value due to the short-term nature of the borrowings.

NOTE 9 — INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for
Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of
deferred income tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net
operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences. The
standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent
that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise,
a valuation allowance is applied.

The income tax provision attributable to continuing operations
and discontinued operations is as follows:

The major tax effected components of the Company’s net deferred tax liability are as follows:

For U.S. federal income tax return purposes, the Company has a
net operating loss carryforward of $6 million, which will begin to
expire in 2009. For state income tax purposes, the Company has a New
Jersey net operating loss carryforward of $133 million, which equates
to a deferred tax asset of $8 million, after federal tax effect, and
before valuation allowance. The New Jersey net operating loss
carryforwards begin to expire in 2004.

At December 31, 2003, there is a $10 million valuation allowance
provided on certain New Jersey state net operating loss carryforwards
and other New Jersey state deferred tax assets because management
believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria
for recognition under SFAS 109. Management believes all other
deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized because of
the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and
expected future taxable income. Accordingly, there are no other
valuation allowances provided at December 31, 2003.



NOTE 10 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases.

The Company leases real estate and various equipment
under operating and, to a lesser extent, capital lease arrangements.
Certain real estate leases provide for escalation of rent based upon a
specified price index and/or based upon periodic appraisals.

At December 31, 2003, the Company was obligated under
non-cancelable operating leases and capital leases to make future
minimum lease payments as follows:

The current and long-term obligations under capital leases are
included in the “Other accrued liabilities” and “Other long-term
obligations” captions, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets. Rental expense for operating leases was $19 million,
$20 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2003,
2002 and 2001, respectively.

Detroit Development Agreement.

Under the August 2002 revised
development agreement with the City of Detroit, MGM Grand Detroit, LLC
and the Company are subject to certain obligations. The City of
Detroit required payments of $44 million, of which $38 million had
been made as of December 31, 2003; the transfer of assets of $3
million; indemnification of up to $20 million related to the Lac Vieux
and certain other litigation, of which $2 million has been paid as of
December 31, 2003; and continued letter of credit support for $50
million of bonds issued by the Economic Development Corporation of the
City of Detroit for land purchases along the Detroit River. The
letter of credit will be drawn on to make interest and principal
payments on the bonds, which mature in 2009. The remaining
obligations have been classified as other accrued liabilities or other
long-term obligations, depending on the expected payment date.

The Company recorded an intangible asset (development rights,
deemed to have an indefinite life) of approximately $115 million in
connection with its obligations under the revised development
agreement. In addition to the above obligations, the Company will pay
the City 1% of gaming revenues (2% if annual revenues exceed $400
million) beginning January 1, 2006.

The Company is currently in the process of obtaining land and
developing plans for the permanent casino facility, and currently
expects the project to cost approximately $575 million (including
land, capitalized interest and preopening expenses, but excluding
approximately $115 million of payments to the City discussed above).
The design, budget and schedule of the permanent facility are not
finalized, and the ultimate timing, cost and scope of the project are
subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects.

The ability to construct the permanent casino facility is
currently subject to resolution of the Lac Vieux litigation. In
January 2002, the 6

th

Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the
ordinance governing the casino developer selection process in Detroit
violated the First Amendment to the United States Constitution,
because of preference given to certain bidders. The Company’s
operating subsidiary did not receive preference in the selection
process. The 6

th

Circuit Court remanded the case to the Federal
District Court, which rejected the plaintiff’s request for a
re-bidding process and determined that the only suitable remedy to the
plaintiff was declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. The plaintiff
has appealed, and the 6

th

Circuit Court has issued an injunction,
pending appeal, prohibiting the City and the developers from
commencing construction pending further action of the 6

th

Circuit
Court. Therefore, it is unknown when construction of the permanent
facility will commence or when the permanent facility will open.



Borgata.

The Company initially contributed 27 acres of land for
its ownership interest in Borgata. Boyd Gaming Corporation
contributed $223 million of cash and Borgata obtained a $630 million
secured bank credit facility, which is non-recourse to the Company.
The Company is required to contribute an additional $136 million in
cash to the venture to fund the project, of which $133 million of such
contributions, including contributions made by Mirage before the
Mirage Acquisition, have been made as of December 31, 2003.

United Kingdom.

In October 2003, the Company entered into an
agreement with Earls Court and Olympia Group, which operates large
exhibition and trade show facilities in London, to form a jointly
owned company which would develop a large entertainment and gaming
facility, which the Company would operate in space leased from Earls
Court and Olympia, to complement the existing Olympia facilities. The
Company made a deposit of £2 million ($3 million based on exchange
rates at December 31, 2003), which is refundable if proposed gaming
law reforms are not implemented by December 2005. Otherwise, the
deposit will be applied to the first year’s rent on a lease between
the new company and Earls Court and Olympia. The Company would make a
nominal equity investment and would provide a loan for half of the
estimated £130 million ($232 million based on exchange rates at
December 31, 2003) of development costs. The agreement is subject to
implementation of proposed gaming law reforms and a tax structure
acceptable to the Company, and obtaining required planning and other
approvals. The Company would own 82.5% of the entity.

In November 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with
Newcastle United PLC to create a 50-50 joint venture which would build
a major new mixed-use development, including casino development, on a
site adjacent to Newcastle’s football stadium. Newcastle United PLC
will contribute the land to the joint venture, and the Company will make an equity investment of £5 million ($9 million based on exchange
rates at December 31, 2003), which is refundable if certain conditions
have not been met by January 2008. The Company would develop and
operate the complex, as well as own the casino development in leased
premises within the complex. The complex is expected to be financed
through project-specific borrowings. The agreement is subject to
implementation of proposed gaming law reforms and a tax structure
acceptable to the Company, and obtaining required planning and other
approvals.

New York Racing Association.

The Company has an understanding
with the New York Racing Association (“NYRA”) to manage video lottery
terminals (“VLTs”) at NYRA’s Aqueduct horseracing facility in
metropolitan New York. The Company would assist in the development of
the facility, including providing project financing, and would manage
the facility for a fee. The project is anticipated to cost $135
million. Work was halted on the VLT facility in August 2003 pending
the outcome of an investigation of certain aspects of NYRA’s
operations by Federal prosecutors. In December 2003, NYRA reached
agreement with the Justice Department whereby NYRA was indicted with
prosecution deferred. NYRA agreed to pay a fine and the indictment
will be dismissed with prejudice upon NYRA implementing certain
reforms and otherwise complying with the terms of the agreement. The
Company’s participation is subject to a definitive agreement,
regulatory approvals and certain legislative changes by the State of
New York.

Guarantees.

The Company is party to various guarantee contracts
in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by
letters of credit issued by financial institutions. The Company’s
Senior Credit Facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can
be issued to $200 million, and the amount of available borrowings
under the Senior Credit Facility is reduced by any outstanding letters
of credit. At December 31, 2003, the Company had provided a $50
million letter of credit to support the Economic Development
Corporation bonds referred to above, which are a liability of the
Company.

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various legal proceedings,
most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business.
Management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will
have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position or
results of operations.

At December 31, 2003, there were 8 million shares available for

In May 2002, the Board of Directors approved a restricted stock
plan. The plan allowed for the issuance of up to 1,000,000 shares of
Company common stock to certain key employees. The restrictions on
selling these shares lapse 50% on the third anniversary date from the
grant date and 50% on the fourth anniversary date after the grant
date. Through December 31, 2003, 903,000 shares were issued, with an
aggregate value of $32 million. This amount was recorded as deferred
compensation in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and is
being amortized to operating expenses on a straight-line basis through
the period in which the restrictions fully lapse. Amortization of
deferred compensation was $8 million and $5 million for the years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and 887,000 shares
were outstanding under the plan at December 31, 2003. In November
2002, the Board of Directors determined that no more awards would be
granted under the restricted stock plan.

NOTE 12 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Employees of the Company who are members of various unions are
covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained, multi-employer
health and welfare and defined benefit pension plans. The Company
recorded an expense of $77 million in 2003, $66 million in 2002 and
$54 million in 2001 under such plans. The plans’ sponsors have not
provided sufficient information to permit the Company to determine its
share of unfunded vested benefits, if any.

The Company is self-insured for most health care benefits for its
non-union employees. The liability for claims filed and estimates of
claims incurred but not reported is included in the “Other accrued
liabilities” caption in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code covering its non-union employees. The plans
allow employees to defer, within prescribed limits, up to 20% of their
income on a pre-tax basis through contributions to the plans. The
Company matches, within prescribed limits, a portion of eligible
employees’ contributions. The Company recorded charges for matching
contributions of $10 million in 2003, $12 million in 2002 and $14
million in 2001.

The Company maintains a nonqualified deferred retirement plan for
certain key employees. The plan allows participants to defer, on a
pre-tax basis, a portion of their salary and bonus and accumulate tax
deferred earnings, plus investment earnings on the deferred balances,
as a retirement fund. Participants receive a Company match of up to
4% of salary, net of any Company match received under the Company’s
401(k) plan. All employee deferrals vest immediately. The Company
matching contributions vest ratably over a three-year period. The
Company recorded charges for matching contributions of $2 million in
2003, $1 million in 2002 and $1 million in 2001.

The Company implemented a supplemental executive retirement plan
(“SERP”) for certain key employees effective January 1, 2001. The
SERP is a nonqualified plan under which the Company makes quarterly
contributions which are intended to provide a retirement benefit that
is a fixed percentage of a participant’s estimated final five-year
average annual salary, up to a maximum of 65%. Company contributions
and investment earnings on the contributions are tax-deferred and
accumulate as a retirement fund. Employees do not make contributions
under this plan. A portion of the Company contributions and
investment earnings thereon vests after three years of SERP
participation and the remaining portion vests after both five years of
SERP participation and 10 years of continuous service. The Company
recorded expense of $5 million, $5 million and $4 million under this
plan in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.



NOTE 13 — RESTRUCTURING COSTS

In connection with the Mirage Acquisition, management initiated a
comprehensive restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve
efficiencies of the combined operations of the Company. This
restructuring resulted in a charge against earnings in the second
quarter of 2000 totaling $18 million, primarily related to the accrual
of costs associated with contract terminations and staffing reductions
of approximately $6 million, the buyout of various leases of
approximately $11 million and other related restructuring costs of $1
million. Approximately 125 people were affected by the reductions,
primarily at the Company’s operating resorts (excluding the Mirage
properties). In December 2002, the Company recorded a restructuring
credit of $10 million related to a lease contract termination accrual
originally recorded in June 2000. In December 2002 management
determined that payment under this obligation was not probable.

In 2001, management responded to a decline in business volumes
caused by the September 11 attacks by implementing cost containment
strategies which included a significant reduction in payroll and a
refocusing of several of the Company’s marketing programs.
Approximately 6,700 employees (on a full-time equivalent basis) were
laid off or terminated, resulting in a $22 million charge against
earnings, primarily related to the accrual of severance pay, extended
health care coverage and other related costs in connection with these
personnel reductions. As a result of improving business levels and
the Company’s success at re-hiring a substantial number of previously
laid off or terminated employees, management determined in 2002 that a
portion of the remaining accrual would now not be necessary. This
resulted in a restructuring credit of $10 million. An additional $2
million restructuring charge related to the termination of the Holiday
Inn franchise agreement at the Boardwalk Hotel and Casino was incurred
in 2001.

The Company recorded $3 million of restructuring charges in
December 2002 related to contract termination costs for a restaurant
and the EFX! show at MGM Grand Las Vegas.

2003 restructuring costs included $2 million related to the
closure of the Siegfried & Roy show, primarily for severance costs of
employees involved in the show’s production. Also, we terminated a
restaurant lease and closed two marketing offices, resulting in $4
million of contract termination charges. Other severance of $1
million in 2003 related primarily to restructuring of table games
staffing at several resorts.

restructuring accruals:

Prior to 2003, the Company classified gains and losses on routine
asset sales or disposals as a non-operating item at some resorts and
as an operating item at other resorts. Management believes the
preferable presentation of these items is as an element of operating
income. Prior period statements have not been reclassified as such
transactions were not material in the prior periods. Until 2003,
demolition costs were typically capitalized as part of new
construction. The Company began expensing demolition costs on major
construction projects as incurred on January 1, 2003, and is
accounting for this change in policy prospectively. Demolition costs
were not material in prior periods. Demolition costs in 2003 relate
to preparation for the Bellagio standard room remodel, Bellagio
expansion and new theatre at MGM Grand Las Vegas.

In October 2003 the Company sold 315 acres of land in North Las
Vegas, Nevada near Shadow Creek for approximately $55 million, which
resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $37 million. Also in 2003,
the Company recorded write-downs and impairments of assets abandoned
or replaced with new construction, primarily at MGM Grand Las Vegas in
preparation for new restaurants and the new theatre.

In 2002, Tropical Storm Isidore caused property damage at Beau
Rivage totaling $8 million, including clean-up costs. The amount of
the write-down for damaged assets was determined based on the net book
value of the assets and engineering estimates. In connection with the
revised development agreement in Detroit, we wrote off $5 million,
which was the net book value of previously incurred development costs
associated with the riverfront permanent casino site ($9 million),
offset by previously accrued obligations no longer required under the
revised development agreement ($4 million). Also in 2002, the Company
recorded write-downs and impairments of assets abandoned or replaced
with new construction.

The 2001 write-down of the Atlantic City Boardwalk land resulted
from a reassessment of the fair value of the land subsequent to the
September 11 attacks. The revised carrying value was based on
comparable sales data adjusted for the impact of legislation
authorizing large-scale gaming in the state of New York, which
management believes had a negative impact on real estate values on the
Atlantic City Boardwalk. The remaining 2001 charge relates to several
assets abandoned during the quarter in response to the September 11
attacks, primarily in-progress construction projects which management
terminated after the attacks.

In addition, the Company engaged in transactions with its
unconsolidated affiliates. In 2003, the Company paid Monte Carlo $4
million as a result of closing the tram between Bellagio and Monte
Carlo in preparation for the Bellagio expansion. The Company leases
two acres of land to Borgata and received $1 million in 2003 and 2002
under this lease. Borgata is required to pay for a portion of the
masterplan improvements at Renaissance Pointe, and the Company is
responsible for environmental cleanup costs incurred by Borgata. The
net amount reimbursed to the Company under these arrangements for the
years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $10 million, $8
million and $9 million, respectively. At December 31, 2003, Borgata
owes the Company an additional $3 million under these arrangements.

Because income per share amounts are calculated using the
weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share
amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total income per share
amounts for the year.

As described in Note 3, the results of the Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries and MGM MIRAGE Online are classified as discontinued
operations for all periods presented. Since the transactions occurred
in June 2003, the amounts previously reported in the March 31, 2003
Form 10-Q did not reflect the results of these operations as
discontinued. The amounts presented above for the quarters ended
March 31, 2003 and 2002 reflect the reclassification.

NOTE 18 — SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

Proposed Acquisition of Wembley plc.

In January 2004, the Company
reached an agreement with Wembley plc (“Wembley”) on the terms of a
cash acquisition by the Company of Wembley. The Company has offered
Wembley’s shareholders 750 pence per share, valuing Wembley at $490
million as of the date of the offer. Wembley has no material
indebtedness. Wembley’s operations consist of greyhound racing and
video lottery terminals at its Lincoln Park facility in Rhode Island,
three greyhound tracks and one horse racing track in Colorado, and six
greyhound tracks in the United Kingdom. A member of the Wembley plc
group, Lincoln Park, Inc., and two executives of the Wempley plc group
are subject to indictment in Rhode Island. The Company will purchase
Wembley free and clear of the indictment and any related liabilities.
Under an agreement with the United States Department of Justice, the
indictment will proceed against a new entity funded by Wembley which
the Company will not be acquiring. The transaction is expected to
close by the third quarter of 2004, subject to requisite court and
shareholder approval, the completion of the Lincoln Park
reorganization and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.

Agreement with The British Land Company PLC.

In February 2004,
the Company announced an agreement in principle with The British Land
Company PLC whereby the Company would operate a casino in leased
premises within a newly developed leisure and entertainment complex
adjacent to the Meadowhall Shopping Centre in Sheffield UK. The
agreement is subject to implementation of proposed gaming law reforms
and a tax structure acceptable to the Company, and obtaining required
planning and other approvals.

Proposed Sale of MGM Grand Australia.

In February 2004, the
Company entered into an agreement to sell the subsidiaries that own
and operate MGM Grand Australia for A$195 (approximately $150
million), subject to certain working capital adjustments. This
transaction is expected to be completed by the third quarter of 2004,
subject to customary sales conditions and regulatory approval. The
results of MGM Grand Australia will be reclassified as discontinued
operations beginning in the first quarter of 2004. The subsidiaries
being sold had approximately $89 million of total assets at
December 31, 2003, of which $40 million was property and
equipment, net and $34 million was goodwill. These subsidiaries
had total liabilities of $11 million at December 31, 2003.
