PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

MGM Resorts International is referred to as the “Company,” “MGM Resorts,” or the “Registrant,” and together with its subsidiaries may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGM China.” Except where the context indicates otherwise, “MGP” refers to MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its consolidated subsidiaries.

Overview

MGM Resorts International is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1986 that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts across the United States and in Macau.

We believe we own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests.

MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through its subsidiary MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). As of December 31, 2019, pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, we lease the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, and MGM Northfield. See Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and the Operating Partnership, which we consolidate in our financial statements, and Note 18 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the master lease with MGP. As further discussed below, pursuant to a lease agreement, we lease the real estate assets of Bellagio from a venture that we formed with Blackstone Real Estate Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”). See Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the lease with BREIT.

Business Developments

In August 2016, we acquired the remaining 50% ownership interest in Borgata, at which time Borgata became a wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary of ours. Subsequently, MGP acquired Borgata’s real property from us and Borgata was added to the existing master lease between us and MGP. In December 2016, we opened MGM National Harbor and, in October 2017, MGP also acquired the long-term leasehold interest and real property associated with MGM National Harbor from us and MGM National Harbor was added to the existing master lease between us and MGP.

In February 2018, we opened MGM Cotai, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort on the Cotai Strip in Macau, and in August 2018, we opened MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts.

In July 2018, MGP acquired the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), an Ohio limited liability company that owned the real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park (“Northfield Acquisition”). In April 2019, we acquired the membership interests of Northfield from MGP and MGP retained the associated real estate assets. We then rebranded the property to MGM Northfield Park, which was then added to the existing master lease between us and MGP.

In January 2019, we acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City Casino's racetrack and casino ("Empire City"). Subsequently, MGP acquired Empire City’s developed real property from us and Empire City was then added to the existing master lease between us and MGP.

In March 2019, we entered into an amendment to the existing master lease between us and MGP with respect to investments made by us related to the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Lease Transaction”).

Additionally, in

November 2019, we formed a venture (the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”) with BREIT, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from us and leased such assets back to us pursuant to a long-term lease agreement (the “Bellagio Sale-Leaseback Transaction”). The lease has an initial term of thirty years with the potential to extend for two ten year terms thereafter and provides for an initial rent of $245 million, escalating annually at a rate of 2% per annum for the first ten years and thereafter equal to


the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to a cap of 3% during the 11th through 20th years and 4% thereafter. In addition, the lease obligates us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the property on capital expenditures and that we comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or a letter of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to rent for the succeeding two year period.

We received $4.25 billion consideration for the sale, which consisted of a 5% equity interest in the venture with the remaining consideration of approximately $4.2 billion in cash.

We also provide a

shortfall

guarantee of the

principal amount of indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture’s $3.01 billion of

debt

(and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon)

.

In December 2019, we completed the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land for $825 million, which consisted of $662.5 million paid in cash and a secured note due 2024 with a face value of $162.5 million and fair value of $133.7 million.

On February 14, 2020, we completed a series of transactions (collectively the “MGP BREIT Venture Transaction”) pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to a newly formed entity (“MGP BREIT Venture”), owned 50.1% by the Operating Partnership and 49.9% by a subsidiary of BREIT. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, MGM and MGP received total consideration of $4.6 billion, which was comprised of $2.5 billion of cash, $1.3 billion of the Operating Partnership’s secured indebtedness assumed by MGP BREIT Venture, and the Operating Partnership’s 50.1% equity interest in the MGP BREIT Venture. In addition, the Operating Partnership issued approximately 3 million Operating Partnership units to us representing 5% of the equity value of MGP BREIT Venture. In connection with the transactions, we provided a shortfall guaranty of the principal amount of indebtedness of the MGP BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). On the closing date, BREIT also purchased approximately 5 million MGP Class A shares for $150 million.

In connection with the transactions, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. The lease provides for a term of thirty years with two ten-year renewal options and has an initial annual base rent of $292 million, escalating annually at a rate of 2% per annum for the first fifteen years and thereafter equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to a cap of 3%. In addition, the lease will require us to spend 3.5% of net revenues over a rolling five-year period at the properties on capital expenditures and for us to comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, will require us to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to the rent for the succeeding one-year period.

In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the existing master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annual rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $133 million.

Also, on January 14, 2020, we, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into an agreement for the Operating Partnership to waive its right to issue MGP Class A shares, in lieu of cash, to us in connection with us exercising our right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem the Operating Partnership units we hold, at a price per unit equal to a 3% discount to the applicable cash amount as calculated in accordance with the operating agreement. The waiver terminates on the earlier of 24 months following the closing of the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction and us receiving cash proceeds of $1.4 billion as consideration for the redemption of our Operating Partnership units.

Resort Operations

General

Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments, and repay debt financings.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Empire City Casino which operates 20 hours a day, every day of the year. Our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We utilize third-party management for specific expertise in operations of restaurants and nightclubs. We lease space to retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.

As of December 31, 2019, we have three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China.


Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations

Las Vegas Strip Resorts.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts:

Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York (including the Park), Excalibur, Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas (until the sale of such property in December 2019).

Regional Operations.

Regional Operations consists of the following casino resorts: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York (upon its acquisition in January 2019); and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio (upon MGM’s acquisition of the operations from MGP in April 2019).

Over half of the net revenue from our domestic resorts is derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities. We market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.

Our casino operations feature a variety of slots, table games, and race and sports book wagering. In addition, we offer our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere.

MGM China

We own approximately 56% of MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Macau is the world’s largest gaming destination in terms of revenue and we expect future growth in the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.

Our current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise. The Macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A., which expires in 2022. The Macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires, though additional casinos require government approval prior to commencing operations.

Corporate and Other

We

have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”) is our most significant unconsolidated affiliate, which we also manage for a fee.

See Note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for detailed financial information about our segments.

Customers and Competition

Our casino resorts operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business.” We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.”

Our primary methods of successful competition include:

•

Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;

•

Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;

•

Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;

•

Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and

•

Developing distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations

Our customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings. We have a complete portfolio of resorts which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our resorts have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our resorts during mid-week and off-peak periods.

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.

Outside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region.

MGM China

The three primary customer bases in the Macau gaming market are VIP gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. VIP gaming play is sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play is obtained through external gaming promoters who assist VIP players with their travel and entertainment arrangements. Gaming promoters are compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover-based commissions. In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions. The profit contribution from the main floor gaming operations exceeds the VIP gaming operations due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. We offer amenities to attract players such as premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for premium main floor players’ use, as well as non-gaming amenities, such as The Mansion and Mansion One to attract ultra-high end customers.

VIP gaming at MGM China is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters purchase these nonnegotiable chips and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate. They also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary customers-related expenses. Gaming promoter commissions are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. In-house VIP commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.


Our key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires. If the Macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the Cotai Strip.

We encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world including, but not limited to, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Australia, and Las Vegas.

Marketing

Our marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting customer relationships.

M life Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both gaming and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. We also offer the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused customers, in addition to M life Rewards, at MGM China. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resorts provide. Our loyalty programs focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers, encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend.

Strategy

We strive to be the recognized global leader in entertainment and hospitality, embracing innovation and diversity to inspire excellence.

The quality of our resorts and amenities can be measured by our success in winning numerous awards, both domestic and globally, including several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association as well as multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide, as well as numerous certifications of our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.

Our strategic objectives include:

•

Operational enhancements.

Drive continuous improvements in operational performance to support enterprise-wide increases in revenue, market share, cash flow, and margins;

•

Financial strength.

Accelerate financial performance through optimal capital structure and disciplined investment of cash flows;

•

Corporate social responsibility.

Continue to solidify the Company’s reputation as a global leader in the principles of Corporate Social Responsibility;

•

Geographic expansion.

Execute a targeted approach to domestic and international expansion to increase global brand presence; and

•

Business model innovation.

Explore the evolution of the existing business model into new lines of business and key adjacencies.

In allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts, spending on strategic developments or initiatives and repaying long-term debt or returning capital to shareholders. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns.

We regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets. Opportunities we evaluate may include the ownership, management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada, or in states other than Nevada, or outside of the United States, accessing new markets for sports and interactive, as well as online gaming. We leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of our brands are well-suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming developments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.

During 2019, we launched the (“MGM 2020 Plan”), a portfolio of Adjusted EBITDAR (as defined herein) improvement initiatives that yielded over $130 million of Adjusted EBITDAR uplift in 2019. We expect to exceed $200 million by the end of 2020 compared to 2018 results. The initiatives are primarily comprised of labor, sourcing and revenue initiatives. We have continued to invest in our operating model by expanding the footprint of our Centers of Excellence and enabling best in class operations through adjustments within corporate and property business units. As part of the second phase of our MGM 2020 Plan, we expect to invest in our digital transformation to drive customer-centric strategy for revenue growth. In addition, we have continued to focus on key growth opportunities to develop an integrated resort in Japan and also continued investments in sports betting through our venture, Roar Digital LLC.


Technology

We utilize technology to maximize revenue and to drive efficiency in our operations. Additionally, technology is core to our ability to provide an enhanced customer and employee experience. We believe that digital platforms and customer experiences are critical to differentiation in our marketplace and are critical components to drive growth in our business. While we continue to automate various aspects of operations in an effort to control costs, we are also investing in infrastructure and platforms unique to MGM such as self-service technology, advanced pricing systems and a host of other platform-based customer and employee services. Our team of world class product leaders and technologists leverage the newest advancements in technology including cloud, advanced analytics, and other methods to ensure speed to market and security of our platforms. For example, our commerce and digital platforms provide our customers the ability to create an itinerary of experiences including self-service booking of accommodations, dining and entertainment, with pricing options unique and specific to them based on their relationship or loyalty status with us. We expect continued and incremental investment in this area as part of the second phase of our MGM 2020 Plan.

Commitment to Employees

We believe that knowledgeable, friendly and dedicated employees are a primary success factor in the hospitality industry. Therefore, we invest heavily in recruiting, training, motivating and retaining exceptional employees, and we seek to hire and promote the strongest management team possible. We have numerous programs, both at the corporate and business unit level, designed to achieve these objectives. We believe in the importance of developing our employees through training and advanced education. Our Pathways Educational Program provides tuition reimbursement and our College Opportunity Program, in partnership with the Nevada System of Higher Education, provides online education at no cost to eligible MGM Resorts employees in the United States. We also offer a student Loan Debt Assistance Program that will match a portion of monthly student loan debt payments for qualifying employees. The MGM Resorts Scholarship Program for Children of Employees awards scholarships to selected children of our full-time domestic employees (excluding executives) based on financial need and academic performance.

Corporate Social Responsibility

We believe that profitability and social responsibility can be linked for long-term sustainability and profitability in furtherance of value to all our stakeholders – our shareholders, our employees, our customers and our communities.

We have a bold vision for how our company will lead the way in social impact and environmental sustainability in the years to come. Focused on What Matters: Embracing Humanity and Protecting the Planet articulates our purpose and our commitment to a set of priorities and goals that we hope can have an enduring impact on the world. We have aligned our efforts with a growing interest from investors to define a set of Environmental, Social and Governance criteria that assists in identifying companies with values that match their own. Focused on What Matters: Embracing Humanity and Protecting the Planet defines our environmental sustainability and social impact strategy in four critical areas: Fostering Diversity and Inclusion, Investing in Community, Caring for One Another and Protecting the Planet. In each of these areas we have adopted goals against which we will chart our progress. We have aligned our goals and our social impact and environmental sustainability priorities to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Focused on What Matters reaffirms our commitment to our guests, employees and partners; to the communities we call home and to the planet we must protect.

Through investment of many years of dedicated effort and resources, our evolving social impact strategy – grounded in prudent fiscal management and long-term focused strategies – have advanced us beyond leadership in the gaming and hospitality industry to national recognition for our accomplishments.

Our core values of integrity, inclusion, teamwork and excellence shape our character and culture, the way we do business, and our CSR practices. Four strategic pillars guide our work.

Fostering diversity and inclusion.

Our commitment to inclusion translates diversity as a fundamental paradigm of the 21st century global economy into long-term human capital leadership, customer market expansion and competitive business advantage. Inclusion is an important, multi-dimensional business imperative that attracts top talent; drives our culture of respect for humanity; leverages the broad diversity of our employees’ talents to drive excellence in collaboration, innovation and financial performance; fuels expansion of our customer markets and supply chain; and forges stronger ties with our communities around the world.

Investing in community.

The communities in which we operate, and our employees live, work and care for their families, are cornerstones of our business. We create economic opportunity for local residents, collaborate to promote educational and develop skills of local workforces, engage local businesses, and stimulate economic development in our communities. We promote responsible gaming practices and tools, such as GameSense, that keep gaming safe and entertaining. Beyond our tax support of public education, infrastructure and services, we make philanthropic and development-related investments in long-term institutions that benefit our employees and customers and elevate the quality of life and culture in our communities.


Caring for one another.

We believe caring for less fortunate community neighbors is a deep-rooted part of our culture, and our actions help uplift the communities in which we operate, while simultaneously instilling employee pride and engagement in our business. Through three primary channels – our employee-driven MGM Resorts Foundation, our Employee Volunteer Program and our Corporate Giving Program, we contribute leadership, funding and manpower to an extensive array of nonprofit organizations that provide services, goods and resources indispensable to our communities’ well-being, development and stability.

Protecting the Planet.

We continue to gain recognition for our comprehensive environmental responsibility initiatives in energy and water conservation, recycling and waste management, sustainable supply chain and green construction. Many of our resorts have earned certification from Green Key, one of the largest international programs evaluating environmental sustainability in hotel operations. Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, Delano, Mandalay Bay, and MGM Grand Detroit have all received “Five Green Key,” the highest possible rating. Many major travel service providers recognize the Green Key designation and identify our resorts for their continued commitment to sustainable hotel operations.

In addition, we believe that incorporating the tenets of environmental sustainability in our business decisions advances a platform for innovation and operational efficiency. CityCenter (Aria, Vdara and Veer) is one of the world’s largest private sustainable developments. With six LEED® Gold certifications from the U.S. Green Building Council (the “Council”), CityCenter serves as the standard for combining luxury and environmental responsibility within the large-scale hospitality industry. Also, MGM National Harbor, The Park, and T-Mobile Arena have all been awarded LEED® Gold certification by the Council.

At MGM China, we incorporate the same commitment to environmental preservation. MGM Cotai has achieved the China Green Building (Macau) Design label from the China Green Building and Energy Saving (Macau) Association.

Intellectual Property

Our principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for, among others, Bellagio, The Mirage, Borgata, Mandalay Bay, MGM, MGM Grand, MGM Resorts International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Beau Rivage and Empire City, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United States. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights.

Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 52,000 full-time and 18,000 part-time employees domestically, of which approximately 6,000 and 3,000, respectively, support the Company’s management agreements with CityCenter. In addition, we had approximately 11,000 employees at MGM China. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 38,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2019. Collective bargaining agreements covering a number of employee job classifications in our Las Vegas properties are scheduled to expire in the first half of 2020. We anticipate negotiations for successor contracts covering those employees will begin in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, in our regional properties, successor collective bargaining agreements will be negotiated in 2020 for MGM Grand Detroit, Borgata and Empire City.  Negotiations for first time collective bargaining agreements are underway for employee bargaining units at MGM National Harbor, MGM Grand Las Vegas, MGM Northfield Park, and the MGM Resorts Operations Contact Center in Las Vegas.  As of December 31, 2019, none of the employees of MGM China are part of a labor union and the resorts are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.

Regulation and Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.


A more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.


to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes (including regulations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities), construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.

In addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations.

Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements

This Form 10-K and our 2019 Annual Report to Stockholders contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements can be identified by words such as “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “seeks,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “will,” “may” and similar references to future periods.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any other of our filings with the SEC could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things, the risks described below.

Risks Relating to Our Substantial Indebtedness

Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments, and our debt guarantees could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations

.

As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $11.3 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis. The Operating Partnership and MGM China, our consolidated subsidiaries, had $4.4 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of indebtedness outstanding. Any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs. We do not guarantee MGM China’s or the Operating Partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and, to the extent MGM China or the Operating Partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into such entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility.

In addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:

•

increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

•

limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;

•

limiting

our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy (including returning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements;

•

making it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or

•

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.

Moreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished. Moreover, our leases with MGP, the Bellagio BREIT Venture, and the MGP BREIT Venture have fixed rental payments (with annual escalators) and also require us to apply a percentage of net revenues generated at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those properties. Such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Similarly, development projects, including any potential future development of an integrated resort in Japan, and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, our senior credit facility calculates interest on outstanding balances using the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”). On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the "FCA") announced it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. Although our senior credit facility includes LIBOR replacement provisions that contemplate an alternate benchmark rate to be mutually agreed upon by us and the administrative agent, if necessary, any such changes may result in interest obligations which are more than or do not otherwise correlate over time with the payments that would have been made if LIBOR was available in its current form. As a result, there can be no assurance that discontinuation of LIBOR will not result in significant increases in benchmark interest rates, substantially higher financing costs or a shortage of available debt financing, any of which could have an adverse effect on us.

Current and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned expenditures

.

Our ability to make payments on, and to refinance, our indebtedness, make our rent payments under our leases and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and other investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates (including CityCenter) and subsidiaries (including MGM China and the Operating Partnership), borrow under our senior credit facility or incur new indebtedness. If regional and national economic conditions deteriorate, revenues from our operations could decline as consumer spending levels decrease and we could fail to generate cash sufficient to fund our liquidity needs or satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants in our debt and lease instruments. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or continue to receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries, nor can we assure you that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional indebtedness on terms that are favorable to us.


We have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 202


, and thereafter. Our ability to timely refinance and replace our indebtedness in the

future

will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above. If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis, we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. There is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements

or leases

.

The agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations

.

Covenants governing our senior credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:

•

pay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;

•

incur additional debt;

•

incur liens on assets;

•

sell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;

•

enter into transactions with affiliates;

•

allow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets or enter into certain agreements; and

•

enter into sale and lease-back transactions.

Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. In addition, our senior secured credit facility requires us to satisfy certain financial covenants, including a maximum total net leverage ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. Any default under our senior credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt.

In addition, each of MGM China and the Operating Partnership has issued debt securities and is a borrower under credit facilities, all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective borrower’s ability to engage in certain transactions, require them to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries. These restrictions include, among other things, limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in other businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer or sell assets.

We are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes

.

As of December 31, 2019 we are required to make annual rent payments of $946 million under the master lease with MGP and annual rent payments of $245 million under the lease with Bellagio BREIT Venture, and will be required to make annual rent payments of $292 million under the lease with MGP BREIT Venture, which leases are also subject to annual escalators as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The leases also require us to spend a certain amount on capital expenditures at the leased properties. As a result of the foregoing rent and capital expenditure obligations, our ability to fund our operations, raise capital, make acquisitions, make investments, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the leases may:

•

make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;

•

increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;

•

require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, pay dividends, repurchase shares and other general corporate purposes;

•

limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;

•

restrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and

•

cause us to lose our rights with respect to the applicable leased properties if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or otherwise default on the leases.

Any of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.


The Company provides a guarantee of the indebtedness of the Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture.

We currently provide a shortfall guarantee of the $3.01 billion and $3.0 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon) of the Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture, respectively. The terms of each guarantee provide that, after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the underlying indebtedness, we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the debt obligation, which amount may be material, and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand, we may need to raise capital, including incurring additional indebtedness, in order to satisfy our obligation. There can be no assurance that any financing will be available to us, or, if available, will be on terms that are satisfactory to us.

Risks Related to our Business

We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow

.

The hotel, resort, entertainment, and casino industries are highly competitive. We do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also expand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the domestic regional markets in which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas, including California, has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. While we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts with well-established and recognized brands, we also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peer-to-peer inventory sources, which allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments from owners. We expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution, innovations in consumer-facing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain customers and related business.

In addition, competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the United States and elsewhere result in the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos. For example, while our Macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near Asia, certain countries in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Japan) and others (such as Taiwan and Thailand) may legalize casino gaming (or online gaming) in the future. Furthermore, currently MGM Grand Paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos in Macau. If the Macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities, we would face increased competition.

Most jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses. Although a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities (which may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise. Furthermore, certain jurisdictions, including Nevada and New Jersey, have also legalized forms of online gaming and other jurisdictions, including Illinois, have legalized video gaming terminals. Additionally, in May 2018, the United States Supreme Court overturned a federal ban on sports betting that had prohibited single-game gambling in most states, raising the potential for increased competition in sports betting should additional states pass legislation to legalize it.  The expansion of online gaming, sports betting, and other types of gaming in these and other jurisdictions may further compete with our operations by reducing customer visitation and spend in our casino resorts.

In addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate. Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.


Our businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations

.

Our ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states and provinces in which we operate. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. As such, our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the Wire Act of 1961 (“Wire Act”).  The DOJ’s updated opinion concluded instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled that the DOJ’s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous and vacated DOJ’s new opinion.  DOJ has appealed the decision of the district court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. An adverse ruling in the Court of Appeals or other disposition of the case may impact our ability to engage in online internet gaming in the future. For a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business, see “Regulation and Licensing” and Exhibit 99.


to this Annual Report on Form 10-K

.

Further, our directors, officers, key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities. If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in the property. State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards. Certain public and private issuances of securities, borrowings under credit agreements, guarantees of indebtedness and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities.

Macau laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, MGM China’s activities in Macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies. We cannot assure you that MGM China will be able to obtain all necessary approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.

In addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. For instance, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. For example, Illinois has enacted a ban on smoking in nearly all public places, including bars, restaurants, work places, schools and casinos. In addition, effective January 1, 2019, smoking in casinos in Macau, including MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, will only be permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms, rather than outside smoking areas or VIP areas. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance.

We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-money laundering laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, commonly known as the “Bank Secrecy Act,” which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) any currency transactions in excess of $10,000 that occur within a 24-hour gaming day, including identification of the individual(s) involved in the currency transaction. We are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, among other things, involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose. In addition, under the Bank Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention. Our compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.


Our business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside

.

Our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions, trade shows and business development. Economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer. In addition, changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstable job market, perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other acts of violence. Consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and timely react to these trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations. In particular, Aria, Bellagio and MGM Grand Las Vegas may be affected by economic conditions in the Far East, and all of our Nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the United States, and California in particular. A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition affecting consumers or corporations generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts, which would adversely affect our operating results.

For example, in December 2019 a new strain of coronavirus (Covid-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. In order to mitigate the spread of the virus, China has placed certain cities under quarantine and advised its citizens to avoid all non-essential travel and other countries, including the U.S., have also restricted inbound travel from China. In addition, China implemented a temporary suspension of its visa scheme that permits mainland Chinese to travel to Macau, and on February 4, 2020 the Hong Kong SAR government temporarily suspended all ferry service from Hong Kong to Macau until further notice. The government of Macau also asked that all gaming operators in Macau suspend casino operations for a 15-day period that commenced on February 5, 2020.  As a result, MGM Macau and MGM Cotai suspended all operations at their properties other than operations that were necessary to provide sufficient non-gaming facilities to serve any remaining hotel guests. Operations at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai resumed on February 20, 2020; however, there are currently limits on the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and restrictions on the number of seats available at each table, and the temporary suspension of the visa scheme and ferry service to Macau remains in place. The Company is currently unable to predict the duration of the business disruption in Macau or the impact of the reduced customer traffic at the Company’s properties as a result, but we expect the impact could have a material effect on MGM China’s results of operations for the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter. Although the outbreak has been largely concentrated in China, to the extent that the virus impacts the willingness or ability of customers to travel to the Company’s properties in the United States (due to travel restrictions, or otherwise), the Company’s domestic results of operations could also be negatively impacted. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts the Company’s results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and any additional actions taken to contain it from spreading.

In addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai (and, to a lesser extent, our domestic properties) from mainland China, general economic and market conditions in China could impact our financial prospects. Any slowdown in economic growth or changes to China’s current restrictions on travel and currency conversion or movements, including market impacts resulting from China’s recent anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals and other ATM limits on the withdrawal of patacas imposed by the government), could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland China and/or the amounts they are willing to spend at our properties. Most recently, in July 2017, the Chinese government, along with Macau authorities, implemented new facial recognition technology on ATM machines in Macau to strictly enforce the “know you

r

customer” regulations for mainland Chinese bank cardholders and in November 2017 new rules were adopted to control the cross-border transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments. It is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. These developments have had, and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland China, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.

Furthermore, our operations in Macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and our ability to retain and hire employees. We compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of the opening of new developments in Macau. While we seek employees from outside of Macau to adequately staff our resorts, certain Macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we only hire Macau residents as dealers in our casinos) and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase. Finally, because additional casino projects have commenced operations and other projects are under construction, the existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations at our developments in Macau, could be negatively impacted.


We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our MGM 2020 Plan.

We have undertaken, and plan to undertake, several initiatives to implement the first phase of our MGM 2020 Plan to reduce costs and further position us for growth. While we believe these initiatives will exceed $200 million of annual Adjusted EBITDAR uplift by the end of 2020, compared to 2018 results, our efforts may fail to achieve expected results. As part of the second phase of our MGM 2020 Plan, we also expect to invest in our digital transformation to drive customer-centric strategy for revenue growth to drive additional EBITDAR uplift, which efforts may also fail to achieve expected results. Execution of our MGM 2020 Plan is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time, and, therefore, our actual Adjusted EBITDAR uplift may differ materially from what we anticipate.

The anticipated benefits of our asset light strategy, including the Bellagio Sale-Leaseback Transaction and MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.

Our current growth strategy is to pursue and execute on an asset-light business model, which involves a comprehensive review of our owned real estate assets to determine whether those assets can be monetized efficiently to allow unlocked capital to be redeployed towards balance sheet improvements, new growth opportunities and to return value to our shareholders. Our ability to execute on this strategy will depend on our ability to identify accretive transactions that optimize the value of our remaining assets. There can be no assurances, however, that we will be able to monetize our remaining real property assets on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or that any anticipated benefits from any such potential transactions will be realized.

Our ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements.

We intend to pay ongoing regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock; however, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants in our credit agreement, and because we are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on receiving cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. We expect our subsidiaries will continue to generate significant cash flow necessary to maintain quarterly dividend payments on our common stock; however, their ability to generate funds will be subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition, any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds available to us, and compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties. In addition, each of the companies in our corporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, future dividend payments may be reduced or eliminated. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.

Nearly all of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.

Nearly all of our properties are subject to triple-net leases that, in addition to rent, require us to pay: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to the landlords as the owners of the associated facilities.

Furthermore, our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costs described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances, regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in leases that now place these risks on the tenant, such as certain events of casualty and condemnation.

In addition, under the master lease with MGP, if some of our facilities should prove to be unprofitable or experience other issues that would warrant ceasing operations, or if we should otherwise decide to exit a particular property, we would remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations even if we decided to cease operations at those locations unless we are able to transfer the rights with respect to a particular property in accordance with the requirements of the MGP master lease. Furthermore, our ability to transfer our obligations under the MGP master lease to a third-party with respect to individual properties, should we decide to withdraw from a particular location, is limited to non-Las Vegas properties and no more than two Las Vegas gaming properties, and is subject to identifying a willing third-party who meets the requirements for a transferee set forth in the MGP master lease, which we may be unable to find. In addition, we could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including sublease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

James J. Murren, our Chairman, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, and William J. Hornbuckle, and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at MGP

.

James J. Murren serves as our Chairman and as the Chairman of MGP. In addition, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, is


also a director of MGP and William J. Hornbuckle, and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, are also directors of MGP. While we have procedures in place to address such situations and the organizational documents with respect to MGP contain provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) to any MGP shareholder to the fullest extent permitted by law, these overlapping positions could nonetheless create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or MGP's management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities, such as potential acquisition targets, or face decisions that could have different implications for us and MGP. Further, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and MGP (or its subsidiaries) regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship, between us and MGP, such as under the

MGP

master lease. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and MGP enter into any commercial or other adverse arrangements with each other in the future.

Despite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of MGP as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding Class B share of MGP, MGP has adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us, including transactions involving consideration in excess of $25 million, must be approved in accordance with certain specified procedures, which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives.

We own the single outstanding Class B share of MGP. The Class B Share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP, and which represents a majority of the voting power of MGP’s shares so long as the holder of the Class B share and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. We, therefore, have the ability to exercise significant control over MGP’s affairs, including control over the outcome of all matters submitted to MGP’s shareholders for approval.

MGP’s operating agreement, however, provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by MGP’s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to MGP if it is (i) approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of “independent” directors (which MGP refers to as “Special Approval”) (such independence determined in accordance with the NYSE’s listing standards, the standards established by the Exchange Act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement), (ii) determined by MGP’s board of directors to be fair and reasonable to MGP or (iii) approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates). Furthermore, MGP’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value, individually or in the aggregate, over $25 million between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand (any such transaction (other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries) under any of the material agreements entered into on the closing day of MGP’s formation transactions), a “Threshold Transaction”), shall be permitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii) such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates).

As a result, certain transactions, including any Threshold Transactions that we may want to pursue with MGP and that could have significant benefit to us may require Special Approval. There can be no assurance that the required approval will be obtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent MGP directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates. The failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives.

We have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China

.

As a result of the extension of the Macau gaming subconcession, we entered into a First Renewed Deed of Non-Compete Undertakings with MGM China and Ms. Ho, Pansy Catilina Chiu King (“Ms. Ho”), pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the People’s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China. While gaming is currently prohibited in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of (i) the date MGM China’s ordinary shares cease to be listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited or (ii) the date when our ownership of MGM China shares is less than 20% of the then-issued share capital of MGM China.

The Macau government can terminate MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise

,

exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022

,

any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business

,

financial condition

,

results of operations and cash flows

.

The Macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental non-compliance by MGM Grand Paradise with applicable Macau laws or MGM Grand Paradise’s basic obligations under the subconcession contract. MGM Grand Paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such non-compliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the Macau government. Upon such termination, all of MGM Grand Paradise’s casino area premises and gaming-related equipment would be transferred automatically to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, and we would cease to generate


any revenues from these operations. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the Macau government.

Furthermore, under the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the Macau government might promulgate in the future. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our Macau businesses. If any disagreement arises between MGM Grand Paradise and the Macau government regarding the interpretation of, or MGM Grand Paradise’s compliance with, a provision of the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the Macau government. During any consultation or negotiation, MGM Grand Paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the Macau government. Currently, there is no precedent concerning how the Macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above. The loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in Macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, the subconcession contract expires on June 26, 2022. Unless the subconcession is extended, or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended, all of MGM Grand Paradise’s casino premises and gaming-related equipment will automatically be transferred to the Macau government on that date without compensation to us, and we will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. Beginning on April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least one year’s prior notice. In the event the Macau government exercises this redemption right, MGM Grand Paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by MGM Grand Paradise, excluding the convention and exhibition facilities, during the taxable year prior to the redemption, before deducting interest, depreciation and amortization, multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to renew or extend the subconcession contract on terms favorable to MGM Grand Paradise or at all. We also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed, the compensation paid to MGM Grand Paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues.

MGM Grand Paradise is dependent upon gaming promoters for a significant portion of gaming revenues in Macau

.

Gaming promoters, who promote gaming and draw high-end customers to casinos, are responsible for a significant portion of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming revenues in Macau. With the rise in gaming in Macau and the recent reduction in the number of licensed gaming promoters in Macau and in the number of VIP rooms operated by licensed gaming promoters, the competition for relationships with gaming promoters has increased. While MGM Grand Paradise is undertaking initiatives to strengthen relationships with gaming promoters, there can be no assurance that it will be able to maintain, or grow, relationships with gaming promoters. In addition, continued reductions in, and new regulations governing, the gaming promoter segment may result in the closure of additional VIP rooms in Macau, including VIP rooms at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. If MGM Grand Paradise is unable to maintain or grow relationships with gaming promoters, or if gaming promoters are unable to develop or maintain relationships with our high-end customers (or if, as a result of recent market conditions in Macau, gaming promoters encounter difficulties attracting patrons to come to Macau or experience decreased liquidity limiting their ability to grant credit to patrons), MGM Grand Paradise’s ability to grow gaming revenues will be hampered. Furthermore, if existing VIP rooms at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai are closed there can be no assurance that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to locate acceptable gaming promoters to run such VIP rooms in the future in a timely manner, or at all.

In addition, the quality of gaming promoters is important to MGM Grand Paradise’s and our reputation and ability to continue to operate in compliance with gaming licenses. While MGM Grand Paradise strives for excellence in associations with gaming promoters, we cannot assure you that the gaming promoters with whom MGM Grand Paradise is or becomes associated will meet the high standards insisted upon. If a gaming promoter falls below MGM Grand Paradise’s standards, MGM Grand Paradise or we may suffer reputational harm or possibly sanctions from gaming regulators with authority over our operations.

We also grant credit lines to certain gaming promoters and any adverse change in the financial performance of those gaming promoters may impact the recoverability of these loans.

The future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods.

We currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods, including the recapture of overall domestic losses to the extent of U.S. taxable income. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered. This evaluation is based on all available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S. operating profits and foreign source income. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and


changes to our assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such change.

Extreme weather conditions or climate change may cause property damage or interrupt business, which could harm our business and results of operations

.

Certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes and winter storms in the United States and severe typhoons in Macau. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our properties, and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water shortage. A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions. Furthermore, such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Because a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified

.

Given that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large number of our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities.

We extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables

.

We conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players, and high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. In addition, MGM Grand Paradise extends credit to certain gaming promoters and those promoters can extend credit to their customers. Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers and gaming promoters could have a significant impact on our results of operations.

While gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.

Furthermore, we expect that MGM China will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extent MGM China gaming customers and gaming promoters are from other jurisdictions, MGM China may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGM China may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. Moreover, under applicable law, MGM China remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers.

Even where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.

We may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits

.

We review our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or write-downs may be required in future periods. If we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.


Leisure and business travel

,

especially travel by air

,

are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events

,

such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility

or the outbreak of infectious diseases

.

We are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. Since most of our customers travel by air to our Las Vegas and Macau properties, any terrorist act or other acts of violence, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

In addition, the outbreak of infectious diseases, such as the recent coronavirus, may severely disrupt domestic and international travel. For instance, the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in several countries, including United States, issuing travel warnings and suspending flights to and from China.

In addition, on February 4, 2020, the Hong Kong SAR government temporarily

suspended all ferry service from Hong Kong to Macau, until further notice

. We are unable to predict the extent to which disruptions to travel as a result of the coronavirus will impact our results of operations but we expect that the current disruption will have an adverse effect on MGM China’s results of operations for the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter.

Furthermore, although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.

Co-investing in our properties, including our investment in CityCenter, decreases our ability to manage risk

.

In addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest, in properties or businesses as a co-investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business. Therefore, the operation of such properties or businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters. In addition, investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject the properties or businesses owned by such entities to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors, or our co-investors could take actions binding on the property without our consent. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.

For instance, CityCenter, which is 50% owned and managed by us, has a significant amount of indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business and its ability to meet its obligations. If CityCenter is unable to meet its financial commitments and we and our co-investor are unable to support future funding requirements, as necessary, such event could have adverse financial consequences to us. In addition, the agreements governing CityCenter’s indebtedness subject CityCenter and its subsidiaries to significant financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on its ability to incur additional indebtedness, place liens upon assets, make distributions to us, make certain investments, consummate certain asset sales, enter into transactions with affiliates (including us) and merge or consolidate with any other person or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its assets. The CityCenter credit facility also includes certain financial covenants that require CityCenter to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio (as defined in CityCenter’s credit facility) for each quarter. We cannot be sure that CityCenter will be able to meet this test in the future or that the lenders will waive any failure to meet the test.

Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects

.

Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to a number of risks, including:

•

lack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;

•

changes to plans and specifications;

•

engineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;

•

shortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor, and inflation in key supply markets;

•

delays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;

•

changes in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, residential, real estate development or construction projects;

•

labor disputes or work stoppages;

•

availability of qualified contractors and subcontractors;

•

disputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;

•

personal injuries to workers and other persons;

•

environmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;

•

weather interferences or delays;

•

fires, typhoons and other natural disasters;

•

geological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and

•

other unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.


The occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction, development, expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects which we might undertake. In addition, the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction, or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts, which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties, including revenue lost while rooms, restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service.

Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future

.

Although we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, acts of war, or terrorism or other acts of violence), each policy has certain exclusions. In addition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence, loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage, and pollution, may not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.

In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event. Furthermore, the leases we entered into in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction and the Bellagio BREIT Venture require us to maintain specified insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain the types and limits of insurance coverage required by these leases and, to the extent such required insurance coverage cannot be obtained at commercially reasonable cost or at all, then we would need to obtain amendments to the leases or face a default by the applicable tenant under the lease, which could have material adverse effect on our business.

We renew our insurance policies (other than our builder’s risk insurance) on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.

Any failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business

.

The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trademarks. We file applications for, and obtain trademarks in, the United States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.


We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States

.

Our operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non-United States laws, regulations and customs. In particular, the risks associated with the operation of MGM China or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include:

•

changes in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions;

•

changes in non-United States government programs;

•

possible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;

•

general economic conditions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements;

•

difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations;

•

different labor regulations;

•

changes in environmental, health and safety laws;

•

outbreaks of diseases or epidemics, including the recent coronavirus outbreak;

•

potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;

•

political instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;

•

economic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and

•

uncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.

These risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

We are also exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the United States dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease.

Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us

.

A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.

We face risks related to pending claims that have been

,

or future claims that may be

,

brought against us

.

Claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Please see the further discussion in “Legal Proceedings” and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

A significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.

Work stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 38,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations, and adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To the extent that our non-union employees join unions, we would have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems. Furthermore, we may have, or acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that are classified as “endangered,” “seriously endangered,” or “critical” status. For instance, Borgata’s most significant plan is the Legacy Plan of the UNITE HERE Retirement Fund, which has been listed in “critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans, a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal. Any such additional costs may be significant.


Our business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results

.

We are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues.

The failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data.

We collect and process information relating to our employees, guests, and others for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted by the various states, the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent (or conflict) between jurisdictions. Various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data retention, data transfer, and data protection. For example, the European Union has adopted a data protection regulation known as the General Data Protection Regulation, which became fully enforceable in May 2018, that includes operational and compliance requirements with significant penalties for non-compliance. In addition, California has enacted a new privacy law, known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the United States.

Compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, and tools to provide security for processing of customer and employee information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including, but not limited to, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks by third parties. In addition, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient

.

We also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availability of our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations. For instance, there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed. Our information systems and data, including those we maintain with our third-party service providers, may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future. In addition, our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations, and result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

We are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.

Many factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers, business partners, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance activities and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in a number of areas, such as diversity and inclusion, environmental stewardship, supply chain management, climate change, workplace conduct, human rights, philanthropy and support for local communities. Any harm to our reputation could impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.

We may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful

.

We intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in other businesses, properties or other assets. Furthermore, we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties, including MGP. Acquisitions and investments in businesses, properties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:

•

spending cash and incurring debt;

•

assuming contingent liabilities;

•

unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;

•

unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;

•

retaining key employees; and

•

consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.


We cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that we will actually realize any anticipated benefits from such acquisitions, investments or alliances. In addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses, the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs, competitive responses, loss or customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention.

In addition, we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non-core, no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. From time to time, we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.

If the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, as well as other taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected

.

State and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees, including taxes and fees on gaming activities. From time to time, legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming taxes. If the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase taxes, including gaming taxes or fees, depending on the magnitude of the increase and any offsetting factors, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. For instance, income generated from gaming operations of MGM Grand Paradise currently has the benefit of a corporate tax exemption in Macau through March 31, 2020, which exempts us from paying the 12% complementary tax on profits generated by the operation of casino games. We have applied for an extension of such exemption to June 26, 2022 to run concurrent with its extended sub-concession.  While our competitors have received additional extensions of their complementary tax exemptions through June 26, 2022, which runs concurrent with the end of the term of their gaming concessions, and we believe MGM Grand Paradise should also be entitled to such extension in order to ensure non-discriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and sub-concessionaires, a requirement under Macanese law,  due to the uncertainty concerning taxation after the subconcession renewal process, we cannot assure you that any extensions of the tax exemption will be granted beyond March 31, 2020.

Conflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China

,

the holding company for MGM Grand Paradise which owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai

.

As a result of the initial public offering of shares of MGM China common stock in 2011, MGM China has stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of MGM China may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of MGM China. Decisions that could have different implications for us and MGM China, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with MGM China, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest.

P

ROPERTIES

The location and general characteristics of our properties are provided in Part I, Item 1. Business. As detailed in the aforementioned section, the majority of our facilities are subject to leases of the underlying real estate assets, which among other things, includes the land underlying the facility and the buildings used in the operations.

The following table lists certain of our land holdings as of December 31, 2019.

(1)

Subject to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and the Bellagio BREIT Venture, in which the land and the real estate assets are owned and leased from the Bellagio BREIT Venture.

(2)

Subject to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, in which the land and the real estate assets are leased from a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership.

(3)

Subject to separate land concession agreements with the Macau government.

(4)

Beginning January 1, 2020, approximately two acres subject to a ground lease with a third party expired, reducing the total acres to approximately 75 acres.

(5)

Beginning February 14, 2020, subject to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and MGP BREIT Venture, in which the land and the real estate assets are leased from MGP BREIT Venture.

As of December 31, 2019, the land and substantially all of the assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas secured the obligations under our senior credit facility. In addition, the senior credit facility was secured by a pledge of the equity or limited liability company interests of the subsidiaries that own MGM Grand Las Vegas and Bellagio. In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, on February 14, 2020, we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement which provides that we will grant a security interest in our Operating Partnership units in the future to the extent our leverage ratio exceeds certain thresholds.

The land and substantially all of the assets of MGP’s properties, indicated within the table above, other than MGM National Harbor and Empire City, secure the obligations under the Operating Partnership’s credit agreement. These borrowings are non-recourse to us.

The land and substantially all of the assets of Bellagio secure the obligations under the Bellagio BREIT Venture indebtedness. We provide a shortfall guarantee on

the principal amount of such indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon)

as further described within “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business.”

The land and substantially all of the assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay secure the obligations under MGP BREIT Venture’s indebtedness. We provide a shortfall guarantee on

the principal amount of such indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon)

as further described within “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business.”

Other than as described above, none of our properties are subject to any major encumbrance.


ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

October 1 litigation.

We and/or certain of our subsidiaries were named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the October 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. The matters involve in large degree the same legal and factual issues, each case being filed on behalf of individuals who are seeking damages for emotional distress, physical injury, medical expenses, economic damages and/or wrongful death. Lawsuits were first filed in October 2017 and include actions originally filed in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada and in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California. In June 2018, we removed to federal court all actions that remained pending in California and Nevada state courts. We also initiated declaratory relief actions in federal courts in various districts against individuals who had sued or stated an intent to sue

.

In connection with the mediation of these matters, we and law firms representing plaintiffs in the majority of pending matters and purporting to represent substantially all claimants known to us (collectively, the “Claimants”) have entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) whereby, subject to the satisfaction of certain monetary and non-monetary conditions, our insurance carriers will deposit funds into a settlement fund covering the plaintiffs and certain other cases that emerged or were filed prior to October 1, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we expect that the total amount placed in the fund to be between $735 million and $800 million, subject to and depending on obtaining a minimum level of participation with escalators based on greater participation increasing the amount payable up to $800 million in the event of 100% participation by certain categories of claimants, as defined in the Settlement Agreement. We have $751 million of insurance coverage available to fund. Following the mediation a few additional lawsuits were filed against us and/or certain of our subsidiaries. While it is possible that these lawsuits may be resolved as part of the Settlement Agreement, no assurances can be made that they will be included. Although we continue to believe we are not legally responsible for the perpetrator’s criminal acts, in the interest of avoiding protracted litigation and the related impact on the community, we believed it was in the best interests of all parties involved to negotiate and enter into the Settlement Agreement. As a result of the foregoing, we believe that it is probable a loss will be incurred and, as of December 31, 2019, we accrued a liability of $735 million, which represents the low end of the range of probable loss. In addition, we recorded an insurance receivable of $735 million, which represents the entire amount of the liability recorded for the settlement of these cases. While we intend for substantially all claimants to be covered by the Settlement Agreement, it remains possible that certain claimants may not join the settlement. In addition, no assurances can be given that the significant conditions to the Settlement Agreement will be satisfied by the Claimants.

If the conditions in the Settlement Agreement are not satisfied and the mediation stay is lifted, we are currently unable to reliably predict the future developments in, outcome of, and economic costs and other consequences of any such litigation related to this matter. We will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses, and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events, new information and future circumstances. We intend to defend against any such lawsuits and believe we ultimately should prevail, but litigation of this type is inherently unpredictable. Although there are significant procedural, factual and legal issues to be resolved that could significantly affect our belief as to the possibility of liability, we currently believe that it is reasonably possible that we could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits. The foregoing determination was made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admission of any liability on our part or any of our affiliates. Given that these cases would be in the early stages, and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them, we do not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range of reasonably possible liability. The insurance carriers have not expressed a reservation of rights or coverage defense that affects our evaluation of potential losses in connection with these claims. Our general liability insurance coverage provides, as part of the contractual “duty to defend”, payment of legal fees and associated costs incurred to defend covered lawsuits that are filed arising from the October 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. Payment of such fees and costs is in addition to (and not limited by) the limits of the insurance policies and does not erode the total liability coverage available.

Other.

We are a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. Management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Common Stock Information

Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbol “MGM.”

There were approximately 3,483 record holders of our common stock as of February 24, 2020.

Dividend Policy

The Company implemented a dividend program in February 2017 pursuant to which it has paid regular quarterly dividends. The amount, declaration and payment of any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors who will evaluate our dividend policy from time to time based on factors it deems relevant, and the contractual limitations described below. In addition, as a holding company with no independent operations, our ability to pay dividends will depend upon the receipt of cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains financial covenants and restrictive covenants that could restrict our ability to pay dividends, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the Operating Partnership and MGM China credit facilities each contain limitations on the ability of the applicable subsidiary under each credit agreement to pay dividends to us. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future.

Purchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer

The following table provides information about share repurchases made by the Company of its common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2019:

On May 10, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had adopted a $2.0 billion stock repurchase program. Additionally, in February 2020, upon substantial completion of the prior program, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had adopted a $3.0 billion stock repurchase program. Under the stock repurchase program the Company may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated agreements. Repurchases of common stock may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The timing, volume and nature of stock repurchases will be at the sole discretion of management, dependent on market conditions, applicable securities laws, and other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. All shares repurchased by the Company during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 were purchased pursuant to the Company’s publicly announced stock repurchase programs and have been retired.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to December 31, 2018. Discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K

for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 27, 2019.

Executive Overview

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We own or invest in several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development and repay debt financings. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities.

Our results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continue to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives.

The Las Vegas Strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2019, Las Vegas visitor volume increased 1% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The Las Vegas market is growing and diversifying with the addition of new sporting events and venues, the expansion of convention centers, as well as music and entertainment events.

The MGM China segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2019 Macau visitor arrivals increased 10% compared to the prior year period according to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government. In early 2020, the rapid spread of a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (Covid-19) identified as originating in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China led to certain cities in China being placed under quarantine and citizens across China were advised to avoid non-essential travel. Certain countries, including the U.S., have restricted inbound travel from mainland China to mitigate the spread of the virus. In addition, China implemented a temporary suspension of its visa scheme that permits mainland Chinese to travel to Macau, and on February 4, 2020 the Hong Kong SAR government temporarily suspended all ferry service from Hong Kong to Macau, until further notice. The Macau Government Tourism Office disclosed total visitation from mainland China to Macau decreased 83% and total visitor arrivals decreased 78% during Chinese New Year as compared to the same period in 2019.

On February 4, 2020, the government of Macau asked that all gaming operators in Macau suspend casino operations for a 15-day period that commenced on February 5, 2020. As a result, MGM Macau and MGM Cotai suspended all operations at their properties other than operations that were necessary to provide sufficient non-gaming facilities to serve any remaining hotel guests. Operations at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai resumed on February 20, 2020; however, there are currently limits on the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and restrictions on the number of seats available at each table, and

the temporary suspension of the visa scheme and ferry service to Macau remains in place

. As a result of these measures, we expect material declines in MGM China’s operating results during the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter.

Additionally,

to the extent that the virus impacts the willingness or ability of customers to travel to our properties in the United States (due to travel restrictions, or otherwise), our domestic results of operations could also be negatively impacted

.

We are continuing to evaluate the nature and extent of the impacts to our business,

which could have a material effect on our consolidated operating results for the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter. Given the uncertain nature of these circumstances, the related impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East Baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results as evidenced by the recent weakness in Far East baccarat, which we expect to continue in 2020. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results.

.

See Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and the Operating Partnership, which we consolidate in our financial statements

.

All intercompany transactions, including transactions under the master lease

with MGP

, have been eliminated in consolidation.

As further discussed below, pursuant to a lease agreement

with the

Bellagio

BREIT Venture

, we lease the real estate assets of Bellagio

.

In July 2018, MGP completed its Northfield Acquisition for approximately $1.1 billion. In April 2019, we acquired the membership interests of Northfield from MGP and MGP retained the real estate assets. We then rebranded the property to MGM Northfield Park, which was then added to the existing master lease between us and MGP.  See Note 4 and Note 18 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this acquisition.

Also, in January 2019, we acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City in Yonkers, New York for consideration of approximately $865 million. Subsequently, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from us and Empire City was added to the existing master lease between us and MGP. In addition, pursuant to the master lease amendment, we agreed to provide MGP a right of first offer with respect to certain undeveloped land adjacent to the property to the extent that we develop additional gaming facilities and choose to sell or transfer such property in the future.  See Note 4 and Note 18 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this acquisition.

In March 2019, we entered into an amendment to the existing master lease between us and MGP with respect to investments made by us related to improvements at Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas. See Note 18 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this transaction with MGP, which is eliminated in consolidation.

In November 2019, we completed the Bellagio Sale-Leaseback Transaction, pursuant to which we formed the Bellagio BREIT Venture, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from us and entered into a lease agreement to lease the real estate assets back to us. The Bellagio lease has an initial term of 30 years with two subsequent ten-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The lease provides for initial annual rent of $245 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first ten years and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3% during the 11th through 20th years and 4% thereafter. We received $4.25 billion consideration for the sale, which consisted of a 5% equity interest in the venture with the remaining consideration of approximately $4.2 billion in cash. We also provide a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of the Bellagio BREIT Venture’s $3.01 billion of debt (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). As a result of the sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $2.7 billion. See Note 1 and Note 12 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this transaction and lease agreement.

In December 2019, we sold Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land for $825 million, which consisted of $662.5 million paid in cash and a secured note due 2024 with a face value of $162.5 million and fair value of $133.7 million. In connection with our review of the carrying value of assets to be sold due to the offer for sale received during the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $219 million.  Upon completion of the sale in the fourth quarter, we recorded a loss of $2 million. See Note 1 and Note 16 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this transaction.

On February 14, 2020, we completed the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to MGP BREIT Venture, owned 50.1% by the Operating Partnership and 49.9% by a subsidiary of BREIT. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, MGM and MGP received total consideration of $4.6 billion, which was comprised of $2.5 billion of cash, $1.3 billion of the Operating Partnership’s secured indebtedness assumed by MGP BREIT Venture, and the Operating Partnership’s 50.1% equity interest in the MGP BREIT Venture. In addition, the Operating Partnership issued approximately 3 million Operating Partnership units to us representing 5% of the equity value of MGP BREIT Venture. In connection with the transactions, we provided a shortfall guaranty of the principal amount of indebtedness of the MGP BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). On the closing date, BREIT also purchased approximately 5 million MGP Class A shares for $150 million.

In connection with the transactions, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. The lease provides for a term of thirty years with two ten-year renewal options and has an initial annual base rent of $292 million, escalating annually at a rate of 2% per annum for the first fifteen years and thereafter equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to a cap of 3%. In addition, the lease will require us to spend 3.5% of net revenues over a rolling five-year period at the properties on capital expenditures and for us to comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, will require us to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to the rent for the succeeding one-year period.


In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture

Transaction

, the existing master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the

annual

rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $133 million.

Also, on January 14, 2020, we, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into an agreement for the Operating Partnership to waive its right to issue MGP Class A shares, in lieu of cash, to us in connection with us exercising our right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem the Operating Partnership units we hold, at a price per unit equal to a 3% discount to the applicable cash amount as calculated in accordance with the operating agreement. The waiver terminates on the earlier of 24 months following the closing of the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction and us receiving cash proceeds of $1.4 billion as consideration for the redemption of our Operating Partnership units.

In January 2019, we announced the implementation of a company-wide business optimization initiative (the “MGM 2020 Plan”) to further reduce costs, improve efficiencies and position us for growth, which yielded over $130 million of Adjusted EBITDAR uplift in 2019 compared to 2018 results. We expect the initiatives associated with the MGM 2020 Plan to exceed Adjusted EBITDAR uplift of $200 million by the end of 2020 compared to 2018 results, which includes operating model changes to improve efficiency. We currently anticipate achieving this target. As part of the second phase, we plan to invest in our digital transformation to drive revenue growth through a customer-centric strategy aimed at increasing customer spend, increasing our wallet share, and attracting our most valuable customers.

Key Performance Indicators

Key performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:

•

Gaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for Baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-Baccarat; and

•

Hotel revenue indicators: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price indicator); and revenue per available room (“REVPAR,” a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites.

Additional key performance indicators at MGM China are:

•

Gaming revenue indicators: MGM China utilizes “turnover,” which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by MGM China calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. Turnover provides a basis for measuring VIP casino win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 2.6% to 3.3% of turnover.

Results of Operations

The following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.

Summary Financial Results

The following table summarizes our operating results:


Summary Operating Results

Consolidated net revenues in 2019 increased 10% compared to 2018 due primarily

to continued ramp-up of operations at MGM Cotai following its opening in February 2018, a full year of operating results at MGM Springfield, which opened in August 2018, the acquisition of Empire City in January 2019,

a full year of

operating results

at

MGM Northfield Park, which MGP acquired in July 2018, and an increase in revenues as a result of the ramp-up of operations at Park MGM, partially offset by a decrease in casino revenues at certain of our other Las Vegas Strip Resorts.

Consolidated operating income increased $2.5 billion to $3.9 billion in 2019, compared to $1.5 billion in 2018. The current year included a $2.7 billion gain related to the Bellagio Sale-Leaseback Transaction, a $220 million loss related to the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land, included in property transactions, net, as well as $92 million in restructuring costs related to severance, accelerated stock compensation expense and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan. In comparison, consolidated operating income in 2018 included a $45 million gain related to the sale of Grand Victoria and $24 million in business interruption insurance proceeds primarily at Mandalay Bay. During 2019, consolidated operating income was positively impacted by the increase in net revenues described above and a decrease in preopening and start-up expenses, partially offset by increases in general and administrative, depreciation and amortization, and corporate expenses, further discussed below. Preopening and start-up expenses decreased by $144 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to the openings of MGM Springfield and MGM Cotai and the completion of the Park MGM rebranding project. Corporate expense, including share-based compensation for corporate employees, increased $45 million compared to the prior year period. The current year period included $20 million of Empire City acquisition costs, primarily related to transfer taxes and advisory fees, $29 million in costs incurred to implement the MGM 2020 Plan, of which $12 million is included in the restructuring costs discussed above, and $11 million in finance modernization initiative costs. The prior year period included $27 million of corporate brand campaign expenses, $19 million in transaction costs, and $8 million in costs incurred to implement the MGM 2020 Plan and finance modernization initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense, and general and administrative expense increased compared to the prior year due primarily to the operations of MGM Cotai, MGM Springfield and Empire City.


Net Revenues by Segment

The following table presents a detail by segment of net revenues:

Las Vegas Strip Resorts

Las Vegas Strip Resorts casino revenue decreased 8% in 2019 compared to 2018

, primarily due to a 17% decrease in table games win resulting from a 9% decrease in table games drop, driven by Far East baccarat, and an increase in incentives, partially offset by a 5% increase in slots win.


The following table shows key gaming statistics for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts:

Las Vegas Strip Resorts rooms revenue increased 5% in 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to a 4% increase in REVPAR.

The following table shows key hotel statistics for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts:

Las Vegas Strip Resorts food and beverage revenue increased 8% in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to the ramp-up of newly opened outlets at Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas and an increase in catering and banquets revenue driven by the completion of the expansion of MGM Grand’s Conference Center in 2019.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts entertainment, retail and other revenue increased 2% in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to an increase in entertainment revenue related to events at Park Theater, partially offset by a decrease in revenue from Cirque du Soleil production shows.

Regional Operations

Regional Operations casino revenue increased 25% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of Empire City in 2019, for which its video lottery terminal revenue is included in other casino revenue, the acquisition of MGM Northfield Park’s operations from MGP, and a full year of operations at MGM Springfield.

The following table shows key gaming statistics for our Regional Operations:

Regional Operations food and beverage revenue increased 15% in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to full year of operations at MGM Springfield, the acquisition of Empire City, and the acquisition of MGM Northfield Park’s operations from MGP.

Regional Operations entertainment, retail and other revenue increased 25% in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to entertainment revenue at MGM Springfield and MGM Northfield Park, ATM fees from the operations of MGM Springfield, Empire City and MGM Northfield Park, and parking fees from the operations of Empire City.


MGM China

The following table shows key gaming statistics for MGM China:

MGM China net revenue increased 19% in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily as a result of the continued ramp-up of operations at MGM Cotai and an increase in main floor table games win percentage. Main floor table games win increased 37% compared to the prior year due to the addition of 25 new-to-market tables at MGM Cotai in 2019 and a 472 basis point increase in win percentage. VIP table games win increased slightly in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the opening of VIP junket rooms at the end of the third quarter of 2018 at MGM Cotai and an increase in the VIP table games win percentage, offset by a 34% decrease in turnover at MGM Macau.

Corporate and other

Corporate and other revenue includes revenues from other corporate operations, management services and reimbursed costs revenue primarily related to our CityCenter management agreement and $68 million in net revenues from MGP’s Northfield casino, which represents revenues prior to our acquisition of MGM Northfield Park’s operations from MGP on April 1, 2019. Corporate and other revenue for 2018 included $133 million in net revenues from MGP Northfield’s casino. Reimbursed costs revenue represents reimbursement of costs, primarily payroll-related, incurred by us in connection with the provision of management services and was $437 million, $425 million and $402 million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. See below for additional discussion of our share of operating results from unconsolidated affiliates.

Adjusted EBITDAR

The following table presents a detail of Adjusted EBITDAR. We use Adjusted Property EBITDAR as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments. See “Non-GAAP Measures” for additional information.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts

Adjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts decreased 4% in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to a decrease in casino revenue, as discussed above, and the inclusion of $24 million in business interruption insurance proceeds at Mandalay Bay in the prior year. Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin was 28.2% in 2019, a 167 basis point decrease compared to 2018.

Regional Operations

Adjusted Property EBITDAR at our Regional Operations increased 24% in 2019 compared to 2018 and benefitted from a full year of operations at MGM Springfield, the acquisition of Empire City, and the acquisition of MGM Northfield Park’s operations from MGP. Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin was 27.3% in 2019, a 68 basis point increase compared to 2018, primarily as a result of the inclusion of Empire City and MGM Northfield Park.


MGM China

MGM China’s Adjusted Property EBITDAR increased 28% in 2019 compared to 2018 due primarily to the ramp-up of operations at MGM Cotai, and an increase in main floor table games win percentage, as discussed above. Excluding intercompany license fees of $51 million and $43 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, Adjusted Property EBITDAR increased 27% compared to 2018. Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin was 25.3% in 2019,

a 185 basis point increase compared to 2018

.

Corporate and other

Adjusted EBITDAR related to corporate and other in 2019 decreased compared to the prior year due primarily to $14 million of non-recurring charges including certain management termination fees and other fees, an increase in corporate expense as described in “Summary Operating Results,” a decrease in income from unconsolidated affiliates, as discussed below, and a decrease in Adjusted EBITDAR related to MGM Northfield Park’s operating results from $45 million in 2018 compared to $23 million in 2019.

Operating Results – Details of Certain Charges

Preopening and start-up expenses consisted of the following:

Preopening and start-up expenses decreased in 2019 due primarily to the opening of MGM Springfield and the final phase of MGM Cotai, as well as the completion of the Park MGM rebranding project.

Property transactions, net consisted of the following:

See Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of property transactions, net.

Operating Results – Income from Unconsolidated Affiliates

The following table summarizes information related to our income from unconsolidated affiliates:


In 201


, our share of CityCenter’s operating results, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $1


million compared to $13

.

Non-operating Results

Interest expense.

The following table summarizes information related to interest expense, net:

Gross interest expense in 2019 increased $32 million compared to 2018 due to an increase in the average debt outstanding under our senior notes, and an increase in the weighted average interest rate related to our senior credit facilities, which was partially offset by a decrease in the average debt outstanding under our senior credit facilities and a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of our senior notes. Capitalized interest was $5 million and $52 million during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The decrease in capitalized interest was due primarily to the completion of MGM Springfield, which opened in August 2018, and the completion of MGM Cotai, which opened in February 2018. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on long-term debt and see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash.

Other, net.

Other expense, net in 2019 increased $165 million compared to 2018 due primarily to a $198 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to our senior notes and senior credit facility, the Operating Partnership’s prepayments on its senior credit facility, and the early retirement of debt related to MGM China’s senior secured credit facility, partially offset by a $11 million remeasurement gain on MGM China’s U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes and a $9 million increase in interest income. Refer to Note 9 for further discussion on long-term debt.

Income taxes.

The following table summarizes information related to our income taxes:

Our effective tax rate for 2019 is driven primarily by the $2.7 billion gain recorded on the Bellagio Sale-Leaseback Transaction. Income tax expense recorded on this gain results in our effective tax rate approximating our federal and state combined statutory rate and minimizes the impact of other items. Our effective tax rate for 2018 was favorably impacted by the reversal of Macau shareholder dividend tax that was accrued in 2017 upon receipt of the extension of the annual fee arrangement and income tax benefit recorded on our Macau operations, partially offset by measurement period tax expense related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).

Cash taxes paid increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to federal taxes paid on the liquidation of MGP OH, Inc., a consolidated subsidiary directly owned by MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP, and an increase in state taxes paid in 2019 compared to 2018.

In addition, we received a refund in 2018 of taxes paid with respect to our 2017 federal income tax return.


Non-GAAP Measures

“Adjusted EBITDAR” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, gain on Bellagio transaction, restructuring costs (which represents costs related to severance, accelerated stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan), NV Energy exit expense, rent expense associated with triple net operating and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in REITs, and property transactions, net. We utilize “Adjusted Property EBITDAR” as the primary profit measures for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as Adjusted EBITDAR before corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and before rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminates in consolidation. We manage capital allocation, tax planning, stock compensation, and financing decisions at the corporate level. “Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.

Adjusted EBITDAR information is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we believe these measures are widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Property EBITDAR, and Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends compared to other periods because these items can vary significantly depending on specific underlying transactions or events that may not be comparable between the periods being presented. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. In addition, we changed our non-GAAP measures in the fourth quarter of 2019, including recasting prior periods, as a result of the Bellagio real estate transaction, to exclude rent expense associated with triple net operating leases and ground leases. We believe excluding rent expense associated with triple net operating leases and ground leases provides useful information to analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors when valuing us, as well as comparing our results to other gaming companies, without regard to differences in capital structure and leasing arrangements since the operations of other gaming companies may or may not include triple net operating leases or ground leases. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR and Adjusted Property EBITDAR should not be viewed as measures of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to net income, because these measures are not presented on a GAAP basis and exclude certain expenses, including the rent expense associated with our triple net operating and ground leases, and are provided for the limited purposes discussed herein.

Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Property EBITDAR or Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin should not be construed as alternatives to operating income or net income, as indicators of our performance; or as alternatives to cash flows from operating activities, as measures of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Property EBITDAR or Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin. Also, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Property EBITDAR or Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin information may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR, Adjusted Property EBITDAR or Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin in a different manner and such differences may be material.

Cash Flows – Summary

Our cash flows consisted of the following:

Cash Flows

Operating activities.

Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates

. Cash provided by operating activities increased to $1.8 billion in 2019 from $1.7 billion in 2018.

Operating cash flows increased in the current year period compared to the prior year period due to increases in our operating income primarily from our Regional Operations and MGM China, as discussed above, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for interest, as discussed in “Non-operating Results” and an increase in cash paid for taxes. In addition, operating cash flows in the current year period were negatively affected by a decrease in working capital primarily related to a decrease in gaming deposits. Operating cash flows in the prior year period were negatively affected by a decrease in working capital primarily related to the timing of significant chip purchases by gaming promoters at MGM China.


Investing activities.

Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.

Cash provided by investing activities was $3.5 billion in 2019 compared to cash used in investing activities of $2.1 billion in 2018. The change was due primarily to $4.2 billion of proceeds received related to the sale of Bellagio, $652 million of proceeds received related to the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land, the inclusion of the $1.0 billion outflow for MGP’s acquisition of Northfield Park in 2018, and a decrease of $748 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by a $536 million outflow for the acquisition of Empire City and a $222 million decrease in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2019 included our $90 million share of a $180 million dividend paid by CityCenter in 2019. Distributions from unconsolidated affiliates in 2018 included our $313 million share of a $625 million dividend paid by CityCenter. The decrease in capital expenditures primarily reflects substantial completion of our development projects at MGM Cotai, MGM Springfield, and the rebranding at Park MGM, as discussed in further detail below.

Capital Expenditures

In 2019, we made capital expenditures of $739 million, of which $146 million related to MGM China.

Capital expenditures at MGM China included $118 million related to projects at MGM Cotai and $28 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $593 million included $49 million related to the construction of MGM Springfield, $52 million related to the Park MGM rebranding project, as well as expenditures relating to information technology, the expansion of the convention center at MGM Grand Las Vegas and various room, restaurant, and entertainment venue remodels.

In 2018, we made capital expenditures of $1.5 billion, of which $376 million related to MGM China, excluding development fees and capitalized interest on development fees eliminated in consolidation. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $340 million related to the construction of MGM Cotai and $36 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $1.1 billion included $368 million related to the construction of MGM Springfield, $228 million related to the Park MGM rebranding project, as well as expenditures relating to the expansion of the convention center at MGM Grand Las Vegas and various room, restaurant, and entertainment venue remodels.

Financing activities.

Cash used in financing activities was $4.5 billion in 2019 compared to cash provided by financing activities of $389 million in 2018. The change was due primarily to net debt repayments of $4.1 billion in 2019 compared to net debt borrowings of $2.2 billion in 2018, partially offset by proceeds from MGP’s issuances of Class A shares in 2019 of $1.3 billion and a decrease of $252 million in share repurchases.

Borrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt

In 2019,

we repaid net debt of $4.1 billion which consisted of the repayment of our $850 million 8.625% notes due 2019, the repayment of an aggregate $2.8 billion of our senior notes, as described below, $750 million of net repayments on our senior credit facility, $1.1 billion of net repayments on the Operating Partnership’s senior credit facility, and $1.8 billion of net repayments on the current and previous MGM China senior secured credit facilities, partially offset by our issuance of $1.0 billion of our senior notes, the Operating Partnership’s issuance of $750 million of senior notes, and MGM China’s issuance of $1.5 billion of senior notes.

In April 2019, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.5% senior notes due 2027. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund the purchase of $639 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.75% senior notes due 2020 and $233 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.25% senior notes due 2020 through our cash tender offers. In December 2019, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the Bellagio Sale-Leaseback Transaction to redeem for cash the remaining $267 million principal amount of its outstanding 5.25% senior notes due 2020, the remaining $361 million principal amount of its outstanding 6.75% senior notes due 2020, all $1.25 billion principal amount of its outstanding 6.625% senior notes due 2021, permanently repay the $750 million outstanding on our term loan A facility, and fully repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

In May 2019, MGM China issued

$750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2024 and $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2026 and used the proceeds to permanently repay approximately $1.0 billion on its term loan facility with the remainder used to pay down its revolving credit facility under its prior senior secured credit facility. In August 2019, MGM China entered into a new $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, on which it drew $776 million and used the proceeds to fully repay the borrowings outstanding under its previous senior secured credit facility.


In November 2019, the Operating Partnership used the proceeds from its November 2019 Class A share issuance to prepay $65 million on the term loan A facility and $476 million on the term loan B facility, which reflects all scheduled amortization plus additional principal, and fully repaid the outstanding balance on its revolving credit facility. The proceeds from the Operating Partnership’s issuance of $750 million 5.75% senior notes due 2027 in January 2019 along with the proceeds from MGP’s January 2019 Class A share issuance were primarily used to finance MGP’s acquisition of the real property associated with Empire City and finance the Park MGM Lease Transaction.

In 2018, we borrowed net debt of $2.2 billion which primarily consisted of the issuance of $1.0 billion 5.75% senior notes due 2025, $368 million of net borrowings on our senior credit facility, $137 million of net borrowings on the MGM China credit facility, and $728 million of net borrowings on the Operating Partnership senior credit facility. Additionally, we paid $77 million of debt issuance costs related to the amendments of the Operating Partnership’s senior credit facility in March and June 2018, the amendment of MGM China’s credit facility in June 2018, the amendment of our senior credit facility in December 2018, and the issuance of the $1.0 billion 5.75% senior notes.

Dividends, Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners and Share Repurchases

In May 2018, our Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase program and completed the previously announced $1.0 billion stock repurchase program. In 2019, w

e repurchased and retired $1.0 billion of our common stock pursuant to our current $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. In 2018, we repurchased and retired $1.3 billion of our common stock pursuant to our current and prior stock repurchase plan. The remaining availability under our $2.0 billion stock repurchase program was approximately $357 million as of December 31, 2019.

In 2019, MGM China paid dividends of $62 million, of which we received $35 million and noncontrolling interests received $27 million. In 2018, MGM China paid dividends of $78 million, of which we received $44 million and noncontrolling interests received $34 million.

During 2019, we paid dividends each quarter of $0.13 per share, totaling $271 million for the year. During 2018, we paid dividends each quarter of $0.12 per share, totaling $261 million for the year.

The Operating Partnership paid the following distributions to its partnership unit holders during 2019 and 2018:

•

$534 million of distributions paid in 2019, of which we received $372 million and MGP received $162 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders;

•

$454 million of distributions paid in 2018, of which we received $333 million and MGP received $121 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity

Anticipated sources and uses of cash.

We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our credit facility. We have significant outstanding debt, rent payments, interest payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures (and required capital expenditures pursuant to the terms of our long-term leases). In addition, we plan to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable.

We held cash and cash equivalents of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2019, of which MGM China held $420 million and the Operating Partnership held $202 million. At December 31, 2019, we had $11.3 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $1.7 billion outstanding under the $3.1 billion Operating Partnership credit facility, and $667 million outstanding under the $1.25 billion MGM China revolving credit facility.

We expect to meet our debt maturities and planned equity repurchases and capital expenditure requirements with future anticipated operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, MGP’s cash redemption of our Operating Partnership units, and available borrowings under our credit facilities. We expect to make domestic capital investments at our resorts and corporate entities of $410 million to $420 million. Additionally, we expect to make capital investments at MGM China of $195 million to $205 million.


As part of the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the consideration to us for the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas included, among other things,

$2.4 billion of cash. Further, in connection with the waiver agreement signed in February 2019, we have the ability to exercise our right to receive cash for up to $1.4 billion of our Operating Partnership units.

With the proceeds from the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction and the cash we expect to receive for redemption of the Operating Partnership units, we plan to repurchase debt and equity securities, as discussed further below. Additionally, in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, we entered into an unsecured credit agreement, comprised of a $1.5 billion unsecured revolving facility that matures in February 2025.

Subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased 11 million shares of our common stock pursuant to our $2.0 billion share repurchase program at an average price of $32.57 per share for an aggregate amount of $354 million. Repurchased shares will be retired.

On February 12, 2020, we announced that our Board of Directors adopted a $3.0 billion stock repurchase program

. On February 13, 2020, we announced cash tender offers

to acquire up to $1.25 billion in aggregate purchase price of our issued and outstanding common stock through a modified “Dutch auction” tender offer at a price not greater than $34 nor less than $29 per share, in cash, less any applicable withholding taxes and without interest, upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in the offer to purchase dated February 13, 2020, and in the related letter of transmittal and other related materials. The tender offer is scheduled to expire on March 12, 2020, unless extended or terminated.

On February 18, 2020, we commenced cash tender offers to purchase up to $750 million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 5.75% senior notes due 2025, 4.625% senior notes due 2026, and 5.5% senior notes due 2027. Holders of notes that are tendered by March 2, 2020 will receive the tender offer consideration plus an early tender premium. The tender offers will expire on March 16, 2020, unless extended or earlier terminated by us. We intend to fund the tender offers with the net cash proceeds from the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, and, if necessary, cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility.

On February 12, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend to holders of record on March 10, 2020 of $0.15 per share, which will be paid on March 16, 2020. In January 2020, the Operating Partnership paid $147 million of distributions to its partnership unit holders, of which we received $94 million and MGP received $53 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.

As discussed in Executive Overview, due to of the outbreak of a novel coronavirus (Covid-19) primarily concentrated in China and the resulting impacts on visitation to Macau,

we expect material declines in MGM China’s operating results during the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter.

Additionally,

to the extent that the virus impacts the willingness or ability of customers to travel to our properties in the United States (due to travel restrictions, or otherwise), our domestic results of operations could also be negatively impacted

.

We are continuing to evaluate the nature and extent of the impacts to our business,

which could have a material effect on our consolidated operating results for the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter. Given the uncertain nature of these circumstances, the related impact on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

Principal Debt Arrangements

See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt agreements as of December 31, 2019.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of December 31, 2019, our off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of purchase obligations, disclosed below, and our variable interest in unconsolidated affiliates, which is our investment in Bellagio BREIT Venture. See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our exposure to risks associated with our variable interest.


Commitments and Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes our scheduled contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:

(1)

Reflects scheduled amortization payments and debt maturities. Refer to Note 9 for further information on long-term debt.

(2)

Estimated interest payments, including the impact of interest rate swap agreements, are based on principal amounts and expected maturities of debt outstanding at December 31, 2019.

(3)

Refer to Note 11 for further information on our leases.

(4)

Reflects future expected cash outlays of our other long-term liabilities recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2019, and, accordingly, we have not included such liabilities above that do not have future cash payments, such as deferred rent. We have also excluded contingent consideration related to the Empire City acquisition, general liability and workers compensation insurance claims, deferred income tax liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits

from the amounts presented in the table as the amounts that will be settled in cash are not known or contingent upon certain future events occurring, and the timing of any payments is uncertain.

(5)

Our purchase obligations represent minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors, primarily advertising and entertainment contracts. Also, although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services, and hence, have not been included in the table above.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.

Allowance for Doubtful Casino Accounts Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers and gaming promoters. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States and Macau. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates the credit worthiness of gaming promoters and casino customers prior to issuing credit. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of the Company’s casino receivables and those due from customers residing in foreign countries.

We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances. At domestic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial condition, collection history and any other known information. MGM China specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial condition and the collection history of the gaming promoter or casino customer.


In addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables, net of discounts:

Approximately $77 million and $48 million of casino receivables and $16 million and $12 million of the allowance for doubtful casino accounts receivable relate to MGM China at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable increased in the current year due to an increase in the age of outstanding account balances at our domestic resorts. At December 31, 2019, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $4 million.

Fixed Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies

Property and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. In addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. For operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.


There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the asset. To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential sale. Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. During 2019, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge relating to the carrying value of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion.

We review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. For our 2019 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative (“step zero”) analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. We elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the Borgata trade name using the relief-from-royalty method, for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 11% in 2019. We also elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the Northfield gaming license in 2019 primarily using the discounted cash flow approach, for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge.

We review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. None of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2019. For our 2019 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. For reporting units for which we elected to perform a quantitative analysis, the fair value of such reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a substantial margin. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.

There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.

See Note 2 and Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.

Impairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates

See Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had no material impairments in 2019, 2018, or 2017.

Income Taxes

We recognize deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences with a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.


We file income

tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income

taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. Our income

tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other

tax authorities. Positions taken in

tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the

tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other

tax authorities. See Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated

financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities

.

We assess our tax positions using a two-step process. A tax position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not” threshold and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized. Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet date. Liabilities we record as a result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current or deferred income tax accounts and are classified as current in “Other accrued liabilities” or long-term in “Other long-term liabilities” based on the time until expected payment. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.

Refer to Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes.


ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

In addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the Operating Partnership’s credit facility. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions

.

As of December 31, 2019, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 10% of

our total borrowings after giving effect to the currently effective interest rate swap agreements on which the Operating Partnership pays a weighted average of 1.821% on a total notional amount of $1.9 billion. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has $900 million of notional amount of forward starting swaps that are not currently effective. The following table provides additional information about our gross long-term debt subject to changes in interest rates excluding the effect of the Operating Partnership interest rate swaps discussed above

:

In addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly related to MGM China and to our operations at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar will remain at the same level. The possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. For U.S. dollar denominated debt incurred by MGM China, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar could have adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, a 1% weakening of the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $15 million

.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Acquisition and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Valuation of Empire City – Refer to Notes 4 and 7 to the financial statements

Critical Audit Matter Description

The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment at the Empire City reporting unit (“Empire City”) involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company determines the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of income-based and market-based approaches and incorporates assumptions it believes market participants would utilize. Under the income-based approach, the Company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, which requires management to make subjective estimates and assumptions, particularly related to the forecast of future revenues and EBITDA, as well as in the selection of the company specific risk premium utilized in the calculation of the discount rate.  The fair value of Empire City reporting unit exceeded its carrying value as of the measurement date and, therefore, no impairment was recognized.


The Company’s goodwill balance was $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2019, of which $256 million relates to the Empire City acquisition completed in January 2019.  The sensitivity of operating results for Empire City to changes in the regulatory environment and competition required the application of a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecast of future revenues and EBITDA, as well as in determining the reasonableness of the selection of the company specific risk premium utilized in the calculation of the discount rate.

How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit

Our audit procedures related to management’s estimate of the forecast of future revenues and EBITDA, as well as the company specific risk premium utilized in the discount rate included the following, among others:

•

We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including the controls related to management’s forecast of future revenues and EBITDA, as well as the controls related to management’s selection of the company specific risk premium utilized in the calculation of the discount rate.

•

We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues and EBITDA and assessed the reasonableness of the forecasted future revenues and EBITDA by comparing the forecast to:

o

Historical revenues and EBITDA

o

Forecast information included in analyst and industry reports

o

Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors

o

MGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION

Organization.

MGM Resorts International (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates casino resorts.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company owns and operates the following integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, and Excalibur. Operations at MGM Grand Las Vegas include management of The Signature at MGM Grand Las Vegas. The Company owns and operates along with local investors, MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan, MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland and MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts. The Company also owns and operates Borgata located on Renaissance Pointe in the Marina area of Atlantic City, New Jersey, Empire City in Yonkers, New York, MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio, and the following resorts in Mississippi: Beau Rivage in Biloxi and Gold Strike in Tunica. Additionally, the Company owns and operates the Park, a dining and entertainment district located between New York-New York and Park MGM, Shadow Creek, an exclusive world-class golf course located approximately ten miles north of its Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Primm Valley Golf Club at the California/Nevada state line and Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi.

MGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an UPREIT) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). MGP has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”): Class A shares and a single Class B share. The Company owns MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class A shareholders are entitled to

one vote per share

, while the Company, as the owner of the

Class B share, is entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares so long as the Company and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below


%.

The Company and MGP each hold Operating Partnership units representing limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. The general partner of the Operating Partnership is a wholly-owned subsidiary of MGP. The Operating Partnership units held by the Company are exchangeable into Class A shares of MGP on a one-to-one basis, or cash at the fair value of a Class A share. The determination of settlement method is at the option of MGP’s independent conflicts committee; refer to discussion below as to the agreement entered into in February 2020 which allows the Company to receive cash of up to $

1.4

billion in exchange for its Operating Partnership units, should the Company elect to have its units redeemed for a


month period following the closing of the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction (as defined below). The Company and MGP’s ownership interest percentage in the Operating Partnership have varied based upon the transactions that MGP has completed, as discussed in Note 18. As of December 31, 2019, the Company owned

63.7

% of the Operating Partnership units, and MGP held the remaining

36.3

% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership.

Pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, the Company leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, and MGM Northfield Park. As discussed further below, pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and the venture with Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT), the Company leases the real estate assets of Bellagio from the Bellagio BREIT Venture.

In

July 2018

, MGP acquired the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), a company that owned the real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park (“Northfield Acquisition”). In April 2019, the Company acquired the membership interests of Northfield from MGP and MGP retained the associated real estate assets. The Company then rebranded the property to MGM Northfield Park, which was then added to the existing master lease between the Company and MGP. Refer to Note 4 and Note 18 for additional information.

In January 2019, the Company acquired the real property and operations associated with the Empire City Casino's race track and casino ("Empire City"). Subsequently, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from the Company and Empire City was added to the existing master lease between the Company and MGP. Refer to Note 4 and Note 18 for additional information.

In March 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the existing master lease with respect to investments made by the Company related to improvements at Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on this transaction.


On November 15, 2019, the Company formed a venture (the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”) with a subsidiary of BREIT, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from the Company and entered into a lease agreement to lease the real estate assets back to the Company. As consideration for the real estate assets, the Company received total consideration of $

4.25

billion, which consisted of a


% equity interest in the venture and cash of approximately $

4.2

billion. The Company recorded a gain of $

2.7

billion related to sale of the Bellagio real estate assets, recorded as “Gain on Bellagio transaction,” which primarily reflects the difference between the carrying value of the real estate assets sold and the consideration received. The Company also provides a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of the debt of the Bellagio BREIT Venture’s $

3.01

billion of debt (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). Refer to Note 11 and Note 12 for additional information relating to the lease and guarantee, respectively.

In December 2019, the Company completed the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land. See Note 16 for additional information related to this transaction.

On February 14, 2020, the Company completed a series of transactions (collectively the “MGP BREIT Venture Transaction”) pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to a newly formed entity (“MGP BREIT Venture”), owned

50.1

% by the Operating Partnership and

49.9

% by a subsidiary of BREIT. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, the Company received total consideration of $

4.6

billion, which was comprised of $

2.5

billion of cash, $

1.3

billion of the Operating Partnership’s secured indebtedness assumed by MGP BREIT Venture, and the Operating Partnership’s

50.1

% equity interest in the MGP BREIT Venture. In addition, the Operating Partnership issued approximately


million Operating Partnership units to the Company representing


% of the equity value of MGP BREIT Venture. In connection with the transactions, the Company provided a shortfall guaranty of the principal amount of indebtedness of the MGP BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). On the closing date, BREIT also purchased approximately


million MGP Class A shares for $


million.

In connection with the transactions, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with the Company for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. The lease provides for a term of

thirty years

with two

ten-year

renewal options and has an initial annual base rent of $


million, escalating annually at a rate of


% per annum for the first fifteen years and thereafter equal to the greater of


% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to a cap of


%. In addition, the lease will require the Company to spend

3.5

% of net revenues over a rolling

five-year

period at the properties on capital expenditures and for the

Company to comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, will require the Company to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to the rent for the succeeding one-year period.

In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the existing master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annual rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $


million.

The real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas were classified as held and used in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2019 as the held for sale criteria were not met as of the balance sheet date.

Also, on January 14, 2020, the Company, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into an agreement for the Operating Partnership to waive its right to issue MGP Class A shares, in lieu of cash, to the Company in connection with the Company exercising its right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem Operating Partnership units that the Company holds,

at a price per unit equal to a


% discount to the applicable cash amount as calculated in accordance with the operating agreement. The waiver terminates on the earlier of


months following the closing of the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction and the Company receiving cash proceeds of $

1.4

billion as consideration for the redemption of the Company’s Operating Partnership units

.

The Company has an approximate


%

controlling interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “MGM China”), which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”). MGM Grand Paradise owns and operates the MGM Macau resort and casino and MGM Cotai, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort located on the Cotai Strip in Macau, as well as the related gaming subconcession and land concessions.

In early 2020, the rapid spread of a respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (Covid-19) identified as originating in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China led to certain actions taken by the Chinese government and other countries to attempt to mitigate the spread of the virus.  Among the actions taken were the implementation of travel restrictions, such as the temporary suspension of China’s visa scheme that permits mainland Chinese to travel to Macau, the temporary suspension of all ferry service from Hong Kong to Macau, the suspension of casino

operations in Macau for a 15-day period that commenced on February 5, 2020, and restrictions placed on inbound travel from mainland China to the U.S. Although operations at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai resumed on February 20, 2020, there are currently limits on the number of gaming tables allowed to operate and restrictions on the number of seats available at each table, and

the temporary suspension of the visa scheme and ferry service to Macau remains in place

. Due to the reduced travel to the Company's Macau properties as a result of these measures, the Company expects a decline in the operating results of its MGM


China operating segments.

Additionally,

to the extent that the virus impacts the willingness or ability of customers to travel to the Company’s properties in the United States (due to travel restrictions, or otherwise), the Company’s domestic results of operations could also be negatively impacted

.

The Company is continuing to evaluate the nature and extent of the impacts to its business,

which could have a material effect on its consolidated operating results for the first quarter of 2020 and potentially thereafter.

Given the

uncertain

nature of these circumstances, the related impact on results of operations, cash flows and financial condition cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.

The Company owns


% of and manages CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”), located between Bellagio and Park MGM. The other


% of CityCenter is owned by Infinity World Development Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates government decree entity. CityCenter consists of Aria, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort; and Vdara, a luxury condominium-hotel. See Note 6 and Note 18 for additional information related to CityCenter.

The Company has

three

reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China. See Note 17 for additional information about the Company’s segments.

NOTE 2 — BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Principles of consolidation.

For entities not determined to be a variable interest entity (“VIE”), the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company owns


% of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity if it has the direct or indirect ability to control the entities’ activities based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are 50% or less owned are accounted for under the equity method when the Company can exercise significant influence over or has joint control of the unconsolidated affiliate, such as CityCenter. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.

The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE. A VIE is an entity in which either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. For these VIEs, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.

Management has determined that MGP is a VIE because the Class A equity investors as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of MGP and consolidates MGP because (i) its ownership of MGP’s single Class B share entitles it to a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares, and (ii) the exchangeable nature of the Operating Partnership units owned provide the Company the right to receive benefits from MGP that could potentially be significant to MGP. The Company has recorded MGP’s ownership interest in the Operating Partnership as noncontrolling interest in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2019, on a consolidated basis MGP had total assets of $

11.9

billion, primarily related to its real estate investments, and total liabilities of $

5.0

billion, primarily related to its indebtedness.

Management has determined that Bellagio BREIT Venture is a VIE because the equity holders as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Bellagio BREIT Venture and, accordingly, does not consolidate Bellagio BREIT Venture, because the Company does not have power to direct the activities that could potentially be significant to Bellagio BREIT Venture; BREIT, as the managing member, has such power. The Company has recorded its


% ownership interest in Bellagio BREIT Venture as an investment in unconsolidated affiliates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, for which such amount was $


million as of December 31, 2019. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with Bellagio BREIT Venture is equal to the carrying value of its investment, assuming no future capital funding requirements, plus the exposure to loss resulting from the Company’s guarantee of the debt of Bellagio BREIT Venture, as further discussed in Note 12.


Reclassifications

. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period presentation

.

Management’s use of estimates.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Fair value measurements.

Fair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments in unconsolidated affiliates, cost method investments, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value measurements also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that includes: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs.

The Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:

•

Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 9;

•

Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed during the Northfield and Empire City acquisition. See Note 4;

•

Level 2 and Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of the note receivable relating to the Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land sale. See Note 16.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents include investments and interest-bearing instruments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Book overdraft balances resulting from the Company’s cash management program are recorded as “Accounts payable” or “Construction payable” as applicable.

Accounts receivable and credit risk.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casino accounts receivable. The Company issues credit to approved casino customers and gaming promoters following background checks and investigations of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately


% and


%, respectively, of the Company’s gross casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily within Asia. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.

Accounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their net carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on both a specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2019, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been recorded.

Inventories.

Inventories consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined primarily using the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost method.

Property and equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of the Company’s property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the determination of income or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2019, and 2018, the Company had accrued $


million and $


million, respectively for property and equipment within “Accounts payable”.

Property and equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:


The Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.

Refer to Note


for discussion on the impairment loss recorded on Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land in 2019

.

Capitalized interest.

The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project. When no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of the Company’s outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete, or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

Investments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates.

The Company has investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses, amortization of certain basis differences, as well as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of investment and recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and losses as well as gains and impairments related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of operating income or loss and classifies non-operating income or losses related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of non-operating income or loss, as the Company’s investments in such unconsolidated affiliates are an extension of the Company’s core business operations.

The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its investment may have experienced an “other-than-temporary” decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is “other-than-temporary” based on its assessment of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group.

Goodwill and other intangible assets.

Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.

No

impairments were indicated or recorded as a result of the annual impairment review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in

2019, 2018 and 2017.

Accounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (commonly referred to as “step zero”) in order to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. In performing the step zero analysis the Company considers macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, current and forecasted financial performance, entity-specific events, and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets of reporting units for goodwill. In addition, the Company takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as well as the period of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a quantitative analysis.

Under the quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the Company’s reporting units discounted using market discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference. Under the quantitative analysis, license rights are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference.


Revenue recognition.

The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers consists of casino wagers transactions, hotel room sales, food and beverage transactions, entertainment shows, and retail transactions.

The transaction price for a casino wager is the difference between gaming wins and losses (“net win”). In certain circumstances, the Company offers discounts on markers, which is estimated based upon historical business practice, and recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. Commissions rebated to gaming promoters and VIP players at MGM China are also recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. The Company accounts for casino revenue on a portfolio basis given the similar characteristics of wagers by recognizing net win per gaming day versus on an individual wager basis.

For casino wager transactions that include other goods and services provided by the Company to gaming patrons on a discretionary basis to incentivize gaming, the Company allocates revenue from the casino wager transaction to the good or service delivered based upon stand-alone selling price (“SSP”). Discretionary goods and services provided by the Company and supplied by third parties are recognized as an operating expense.

For casino wager transactions that include incentives earned by customers under the Company’s loyalty programs, the Company allocates a portion of net win based upon the SSP of such incentive (less estimated breakage). This allocation is deferred and recognized as revenue when the customer redeems the incentive. When redeemed, revenue is recognized in the department that provides the goods or service. Redemption of loyalty incentives at third party outlets are deducted from the loyalty liability and amounts owed are paid to the third party, with any discount received recorded as other revenue. Commissions and incentives provided to gaming customers were $

2.5

billion, $

2.3

billion and $

2.1

billion for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

After allocating revenue to other goods and services provided as part of casino wager transactions, the Company records the residual amount to casino revenue.

The transaction price of rooms, food and beverage, and retail contracts is the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services. The transaction price for such contracts is recorded as revenue when the good or service is transferred to the customer over their stay at the hotel or when the delivery is made for the food & beverage and retail & other contracts. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. For some arrangements, the Company acts as an agent in that it arranges for another party to transfer goods and services, which primarily include certain of the Company’s entertainment shows as well as customer rooms arranged by online travel agents.

The Company also has other contracts that include multiple goods and services, such as packages that bundle food, beverage, or entertainment offerings with hotel stays and convention services. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each good or service based on its relative SSP. The Company primarily determines the SSP of rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, and retail goods and services based on the amount that the Company charges when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers.

Contract and Contract-Related Liabilities.

There may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue, resulting in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer, (2) loyalty program obligations, which represents the deferred allocation of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, as discussed above, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided such as advance ticket sales and deposits on rooms and convention space or for unpaid wagers. These liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The following table summarizes the activity related to contract and contract-related liabilities:

Reimbursed cost.

Costs reimbursed pursuant to management services are recognized as revenue in the period it incurs the costs as this reflects when the Company performs its related performance obligation and is entitled to reimbursement. Reimbursed costs relate primarily to the Company’s management of CityCenter.


Revenue by source.

The Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, room, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail and other) and by relevant geographic region within Note 17.

Leases.

The Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains a lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset.

For leases with terms greater than twelve months, the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. The initial measurement of the operating lease ROU assets also includes any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any previously accrued deferred rent. When available, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value; however, most of the Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate. Therefore, the Company typically uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments based on the information available at commencement date. Many of the Company’s leases include fixed rental escalation clauses that are factored into the determination of lease payments. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. For operating leases, lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset depreciates on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the ROU asset and the lease liability accretes interest based on the interest method using the discount rate determined at lease commencement.

The Company is a lessor under certain of its lease arrangements.

Lease revenues earned by the Company from third parties are classified within the line item corresponding to the type or nature of the tenant’s good or service. Lease revenues include $


million, $


million and $


million recorded within food and beverage revenue for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and $


million, $


million and $


million recorded within entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. Lease revenues from the rental of hotel rooms are recorded as rooms revenues within the consolidated statements of operations.

Advertising.

The Company expenses advertising costs as they are incurred. Advertising expense, which is generally included in general and administrative expenses, was $


million, $


million and $


million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Corporate expense.

Corporate expense represents unallocated payroll, aircraft costs, professional fees and various other expenses not directly related to the Company’s casino resort operations. In addition, corporate expense includes the costs associated with the Company’s evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, which are expensed as incurred.

Preopening and start-up expenses.

Preopening and start-up costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as preopening and start-up expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and other expenses related to new or start-up operations.

Property transactions, net.

The Company classifies transactions such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and normal gains and losses on the sale of assets as “Property transactions, net.” See Note 16 for a detailed discussion of these amounts.

Redeemable noncontrolling interest.

Certain noncontrolling interest parties have non-voting economic interests in MGM National Harbor which provide for annual preferred distributions by MGM National Harbor to the noncontrolling interest parties based on a percentage of its annual net gaming revenue (as defined in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions are accrued each quarter and are paid 90-days after the end of each fiscal year. Beginning on December 31, 2019, the noncontrolling interest parties each have the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portion of their interests for a purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula.

The Company has recorded the interests as “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and not stockholders’ equity because their redemption is not exclusively in the Company’s control. The interests were initially accounted for at fair value. Subsequently, the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests to equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company records any changes caused by such an adjustment in capital in excess of par value. Additionally, the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is adjusted for accrued annual preferred distributions, with changes caused by such adjustments recorded within net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.


Income per share of common stock.

The table below reconciles basic and diluted income per share of common stock. Diluted net income attributable to common stockholders includes adjustments for redeemable noncontrolling interests and the potentially dilutive effect on the Company’s equity interests in MGP and MGM China due to shares outstanding under their respective stock compensation plans.

Diluted weighted-average common and common equivalent shares include adjustments for potential dilution of share-based awards outstanding under the Company’s stock compensation plan.

Currency translation.

The Company translates the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries that are not denominated in U.S. dollars. Balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurements are recorded to other non-operating income (expense).

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Comprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) and all other non-stockholder changes in equity, or other comprehensive income (loss). Elements of the Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reported in the accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to cash flow hedges will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on the corresponding variable-rate debt.

Recently issued accounting standards.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASC 842 “Leases (Topic 842)”, which replaces the existing guidance in Topic 840, “Leases”, (“ASC 842”). ASC 842 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. ASC 842 requires a dual approach for lessee accounting under which a lessee would classify and account for its lease agreements as either finance or operating. Both finance and operating leases will result in the lessee recognizing a ROU asset and a corresponding lease liability. For finance leases, the lessee will recognize interest expense associated with the lease liability and depreciation expense associated with the ROU asset; and for operating leases, the lessee will recognize straight-line lease expense. The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019 utilizing the simplified transition method and accordingly did not recast comparative period financial information. The Company elected the basket of transition practical expedients which includes not needing to reassess: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases, and (3) direct costs for any existing leases. As a result of adoption, the Company recognized $


million of operating ROU assets and $


million of operating lease liabilities as of January 1, 2019.

Prior to the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the MGP master lease between subsidiaries of MGM and MGP was accounted for as a failed sale of the real estate assets due to the subsidiaries’ investments in the Operating Partnership, which constituted continuing involvement. As such, the real estate assets were reflected in the balance sheets of the applicable MGM subsidiaries as well as the associated finance lease liability. In connection with the adoption of ASC 842, the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets under the master lease now qualify as a passed sale and are determined to be operating leases. Accordingly, the real estate assets are now only reflected on the balance sheet of MGP and the MGM subsidiaries have recorded operating lease liabilities and operating ROU assets. The MGP master lease and its related accounting eliminates in consolidation

.


In June 2016, the FASB issued ASC 326 “Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurements of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments” (“ASC 326”), which replaces the existing incurred loss model with a current expected credit loss (CECL) model that requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The Company would be required to use a forward-looking CECL model for accounts receivables, guarantees, and other financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASC 326 on January 1, 2020 and does not expect ASC 326 to have a material impact on its financial statements.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes,” (“ASU 2019-12”), which simplifies the accounting for income taxes and includes removal of certain exceptions to the general principles of ASC 740, Income Taxes, and simplification in several other areas such as accounting for a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income. ASU 2019-12 is effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact ASU 2019-12 will have on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures.

NOTE 3 — ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET

Accounts receivable, net consisted of the following:

NOTE 4 — ACQUISITION

Empire City

On

January 29, 2019

, the Company acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City for total consideration of approximately $


million, plus customary working capital and other adjustments. The fair value of consideration paid included the issuance of approximately $


million of the Company’s common stock, the incurrence of a new bridge facility, and the remaining balance in cash. If Empire City is awarded a license for live table games on or prior to December 31, 2022 and the Company accepts such license by December 31, 2024, the Company will pay additional consideration of $


million. The acquisition expands the Company’s presence in the northeast region and greater New York City market. Subsequent to the Company’s acquisition, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from the Company and Empire City was added to the existing master lease between the Company and MGP

. See Note 18 for additional information.

The Company recognized


% of the assets and liabilities of Empire City at fair value on the date of acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using both level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets, and level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company received updated information regarding facts and circumstances in existence as of the acquisition date that impacted the forecasted revenues and expenses utilized in the preliminary purchase price valuation. As a result, the Company recorded a measurement period adjustment that included a $


million decrease to the racing and

gaming license, a $


million decrease to other intangible assets and a $


million decrease to deferred income taxes, with the offset to goodwill

.


The following table sets forth the purchase price allocation (in thousands):

The Company recognized the identifiable intangible assets at fair value. The estimated fair values of the intangible assets were determined using methodologies under the income approach based on significant inputs that were not observable. The gaming license is an indefinite-lived intangible asset and the customer lists and trade name acquired, both of which comprise other intangible assets above, are amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately four and

five years

, respectively. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the potential for a conversion to a full-scale gaming facility

.

For the period from January 29, 2019 through December 31, 2019, Empire City’s net revenue was $


million, operating income was $


million and net income was $


million. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition have not been presented because it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.

Northfield

On July 6, 2018, MGP completed its acquisition of


% of the membership interests of Northfield for a purchase price of approximately $

1.1

billion (“Northfield Acquisition”). MGP funded the acquisition through a $


million draw on the Operating Partnership’s term loan A and a $


million draw under the Operating Partnership’s revolving credit facility, with the remainder of the purchase price paid with cash on hand. The acquisition expanded MGP’s real estate assets and diversified MGP’s geographic reach.

MGP recognized


% of the assets and liabilities of Northfield at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using both level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets, and level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs.

The following table sets forth the purchase price allocation (in thousands):

MGP recognized the identifiable intangible assets at fair value. The estimated fair values of the intangible assets were determined using methodologies under the income approach based on significant inputs that were not observable. The goodwill was primarily attributed to the synergies expected to arise after the acquisition.

In April 2019, the Company subsequently acquired the membership interests of Northfield from MGP, and MGP retained the associated real estate assets. MGM Northfield Park was then added to the existing master lease between the Company and MGP. Refer to Note 18 for additional information.

For the period from July 6, 2018 through December 31, 2018, Northfield’s net revenue was $


million, operating income and net income were both $


million. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition have not been presented because it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.

Summarized balance sheet information is as follows:

Summarized results of operations are as follows:

Basis Differences

The Company’s investments in unconsolidated affiliates do not equal the Company’s share of venture-level equity due to various basis differences. Basis differences related to depreciable assets are being amortized based on the useful lives of the related assets and liabilities, and basis differences related to non–depreciable assets, such as land and indefinite-lived intangible assets, are not being amortized.

Differences between the Company’s share of venture-level equity and investment balances are as follows:

Primarily relates to land and fixed assets.

(2)

Relates to interest capitalized on the Company’s investment balance during development and construction stages.

(3)

Created by contributions to CityCenter under the completion guarantee recognized as equity contributions by CityCenter split between the members.


(4)

Relates to a deferred gain on assets contributed to CityCenter upon formation of CityCenter.

Indefinite-lived intangible assets.

The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of development rights in Detroit, gaming and racing licenses for MGM Northfield Park, and trademarks and trade names, which is primarily related to Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Borgata, and Empire City.

MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession.

Pursuant to the agreement dated June 19, 2004 between MGM Grand Paradise and Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A. (“SJMSA”), a gaming sub-concession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of chance and other casino games for a period of


years commencing on April 20, 2005.

In March 2019, MGM Grand Paradise and SJMSA

entered into a Sub-Concession Extension Contract (the “Extension Agreement”), pursuant to which the gaming sub-concession was extended to

June 26, 2022

, which coincides with the current expiration of all the other concessionaires and sub-concessionaires.

MGM Grand Paradise paid the government of Macau approximately $


million and paid SJMSA approximately $


million as a contract premium for such extension. The Company cannot provide any assurance that the gaming sub-concession will be extended beyond the current terms; however, management believes that the gaming sub-concession will be extended, given that the Cotai land concession agreement with the government extends significantly beyond the gaming sub-concession. As such, as of December 31, 2019, the Company amortizes the gaming sub-concession intangible asset on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the Cotai land concession, ending in January 2038.

MGM Macau land concession.

MGM Grand Paradise entered into a contract with the Macau government to use the land under MGM Macau commencing from April 6, 2006. The land use right has an initial term through April 6, 2031, subject to renewal for additional periods. Upon the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the below market component of the MGM Macau land concession, recognized prior to ASC 842 adoption as an intangible asset, is now reflected within the ROU operating asset recorded for the MGM Macau land concession.

Customer lists.

million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of its initial term of


years, beginning in December 2016, when MGM National Harbor started operations. The license fee paid to the State of Massachusetts of $


million is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that is amortized over a period of


years, beginning in August 2018, when MGM Springfield started operations.

million related to MGM China’s term loan amortization payments in excess of available borrowings under the previous MGM China revolving credit facility were classified as current as of December 31, 2018.

Interest expense, net consisted of the following:

Senior credit facility.

At December 31,

2019, the Company’s senior credit facility consisted of a $

1.5

billion revolving facility. The revolving facility bears interest of LIBOR plus

1.50

% to

2.25

% determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing grid and will mature in December


. At December 31, 2019,

no

amounts were drawn on the revolving credit facility. In November 2019, the Company used a portion of the net proceeds of the Bellagio transaction to pay off all $


million outstanding on the term loan A facility, which was subsequently extinguished, and fully paid down its revolving facility.

The senior credit facility contains representations and warranties, customary events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that the Company maintain compliance with a maximum total net leverage ratio, a maximum first lien net leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio.


As of December 31, 2019, the senior credit facility is secured by (i) a mortgage on the real properties comprising the MGM Grand Las Vegas, (ii) a pledge of substantially all existing and future personal property of the subsidiaries of the Company that own the MGM Grand Las Vegas; and (iii) a pledge of the equity or limited liability company interests of the entities that own the MGM Grand Las Vegas and the Bellagio. In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, on February 14, 2020, we entered into a new unsecured credit agreement which provides that we will grant a security interest in our Operating Partnership units in the future to the extent our leverage ratio exceeds certain thresholds

.

In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the Company entered into an unsecured credit agreement, comprised of a $

1.5

billion unsecured revolving facility that matures in

February 2025

, and the revolving commitments under the prior credit agreement were terminated.

Operating Partnership senior credit facility.

At December 31, 2019, the Operating Partnership’s senior secured credit facility consisted of a $


million term loan A facility, a $

1.3

billion term loan B facility, and a $

1.35

billion revolving credit facility. The revolving and term loan A facilities bear interest of LIBOR plus

1.75

% to

2.25

% determined by reference to a total net leverage ratio pricing grid. The revolving and term loan A facilities will mature in June


. The term loan B facility bears interest of LIBOR plus

2.00

% and will mature in

March 2025

.

The term loan facilities are subject to amortization of principal in equal quarterly installments of approximately $


million and $


million for the term loan A facility and term loan B facility, respectively, with the balances due at maturity. In November 2019, the Operating Partnership used the proceeds from its equity offering, discussed in Note 13, to prepay $


million on the term loan A facility and $


million on the term loan B facility, which reflects all scheduled amortization plus additional principal. At December 31, 2019, the interest rate on the term loan A facility was

3.55

% and the interest rate on the term loan B facility was

3.80

%. At December 31, 2019,

In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the Operating Partnership amended its senior secured credit facility to, among other things, allow for the transaction to occur, permit the incurrence by the Operating Partnership of a nonrecourse guarantee for debt of the MGP BREIT Venture, and permit incurrence of a bridge loan facility. As a result of the transaction and the amendment, the Operating Partnership repaid its $

1.3

billion outstanding term loan B facility in full with the proceeds of a bridge facility, which was then assumed by the MGP BREIT Venture as partial consideration for the Operating Partnership’s contribution. Additionally, the Operating Partnership used the proceeds from the settlement of the forward equity issuances to pay off the balance of its term loan A facility in full.

The Operating Partnership credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default and positive and negative covenants. The revolving credit facility and term loan A facility also require the Operating Partnership maintain compliance with a maximum senior secured net debt to adjusted total assets ratio, a maximum total net debt to adjusted assets ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio. The Operating Partnership was in compliance with its credit facility covenants at December 31, 2019.

The Operating Partnership senior credit facility is guaranteed by each of the Operating Partnership’s existing and subsequently acquired direct and indirect wholly owned material domestic restricted subsidiaries, and secured by a first priority lien security interest on substantially all of the Operating Partnership’s and such restricted subsidiaries’ material assets, including mortgages on its real estate, excluding the real estate assets of MGM National Harbor and Empire City, and subject to other customary exclusions.

The Operating Partnership is party to interest rate swaps to mitigate the interest rate risk inherent in its senior credit facility. As of December 31, 2019, the Operating Partnership has effective interest rate swap agreements on which it pays a weighted average fixed rate of

1.821

% on total notional amount of $

1.9

billion.

The Operating Partnership has an additional $


million total notional amount of forward starting interest rate swaps that are not currently effective.

MGM China credit facility.

At December 31, 2019, the MGM China credit facility consisted of a $

1.25

billion unsecured revolving credit facility. In August 2019, MGM China entered into a new $

1.25

billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, on which it drew $


million and used the proceeds to fully repay the borrowings outstanding under its previous secured credit facility. The new revolving credit facility matures in

May 2024

and bears interest at a fluctuating rate per annum based on

HIBOR

plus

1.625

% to

2.75

%, as determined by MGM China’s leverage ratio. During 2019, MGM China also used the proceeds from its senior notes issuance, discussed below, to permanently repay $

1.0

billion of the previous term loan facilities, with the remaining proceeds used to pay down outstanding borrowings under its previous revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2019, $


million was outstanding on the revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2019, the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was

4.95

The MGM China credit facility contains customary representations and warranties, events of default, and positive, negative and financial covenants, including that MGM China maintains compliance with a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio

.

Due to the impact of the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, discussed in Note 1, MGM China

entered into an amendment to its credit agreement on February 21, 2020 that provided for

an increase of its maximum leverage ratio for the first quarter of 2020

,

a waiver of its maximum leverage ratio beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and extending through the first quarter of 2021

, and

a decrease of its minimum interest coverage ratio beginning in the second quarter of 2020 and extending through the first quarter of 2021

NOTE 10 — INCOME TAXES

The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences. The Company recognizes future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.

Income (loss) before income taxes for domestic and foreign operations consisted of the following:


The benefit (provision) for income taxes attributable to income (loss) before income taxes is as follows:

A reconciliation of the federal income tax statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:


The tax-effected components of the Company’s net deferred tax liability are as follows:

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that are generally applicable to tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Company’s accounting for certain elements of the Tax Act was incomplete as of December 31, 2017. Consequently, the Company recorded non-cash income tax expense totaling $


million during the measurement period in 2018, as it adjusted its valuation allowance on its foreign tax credit (FTC) carryovers to account for guidance clarifying the treatment of FTCs resulting from Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) and other provisions impacting FTC utilization. These measurement period adjustments increased the Company’s effective tax rate by


% during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company finalized its accounting for the tax treatment of indirect costs of providing certain employee fringe benefits subject to limitation under the Tax Act. This measurement period adjustment had an immaterial impact on the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2018.  The Company’s accounting for the impact of the Tax Act is complete.

The Company has made an accounting policy decision to treat taxes due, if any, on future inclusions in U.S. taxable income under the GILTI provisions as a current period expense when incurred. Accordingly, the Company has not provided a deferred tax liability for any GILTI taxes that may result in future periods.


The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $

2.47

billion on its FTC carryover of $

2.6

billion as of December 31, 2019, resulting in an FTC net deferred tax asset of $


million. The FTCs are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is


% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. Because MGM Grand Paradise is presently exempt from the Macau 12% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes. While the Company generally does not expect to generate new FTC carryovers under the Tax Act, it will be able to utilize its existing FTC carryovers to the extent that it has active foreign source income during the


-year FTC carryforward period. Such foreign source income includes the recapture, to the extent of U.S. taxable income, of overall domestic losses that totaled $


million at December 31, 2019. The Company relies on future U.S. source operating income in assessing utilization of the overall domestic losses and, by extension, future FTC realization during the 10-year FTC carryover period. The FTC carryovers will expire if not utilized as follows: $


million in 2022; $


million in 2023; $


million in 2024; $


million in 2025; and $


million in 2027.

The Company’s assessment of the realization of its FTC deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S. operating profits and foreign source income. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to such assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such change.

MGM Grand Paradise has been granted an exemption from the Macau


% complementary tax on gaming profits through March 31, 2020. Absent this exemption, “Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have decreased by $


million and $


million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and diluted earnings per share would have decreased by $

0.10

and $

0.08

in 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Given the Extension Agreement entered into during the first quarter, MGM Grand Paradise has applied for an extension of the gaming profits complementary tax exemption to June 26, 2022

to run concurrent with its extended sub-concession. Competitors of MGM Grand Paradise have received additional extensions of their complementary tax exemptions through June 26, 2022, which runs concurrent with the end of the term of their gaming concessions. The Company believes MGM Grand Paradise should also be entitled to such extension in order to ensure non-discriminatory treatment among gaming concessionaires and sub-concessionaires, a requirement under Macanese law. Based upon these developments, the Company during the first quarter re-measured the net deferred tax liability of MGM Grand Paradise assuming that it will receive an additional extension of its complementary tax exemption through June 26, 2022. This change in assumption resulted in a net increase in deferred tax liabilities in the amount of $


million, due to an increase in the valuation allowance on certain net operating loss deferred tax assets partially offset by a reduction in certain intangible deferred tax liabilities, and a corresponding increase in the provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company has assumed that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau


% complementary tax on gaming profits for all periods beyond June 26, 2022 and has factored that assumption into the measurement of Macau deferred tax assets and liabilities.

Non-gaming operations remain subject to the Macau complementary tax. MGM Grand Paradise had at December 31, 2019 a complementary tax net operating loss carryforward of $

1.15

billion resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized against non-gaming income in years 2020 through 2022.

MGM Grand Paradise’s exemption from the 12% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to MGM China. However, MGM Grand Paradise has had an agreement with the Macau government to settle the 12% complementary tax that would otherwise be due by its shareholder, MGM China, on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment (“annual fee arrangement”) regardless of the amount of distributable dividends. On March 15, 2018, MGM Grand Paradise executed an extension of the annual fee arrangement, which covers the distributions of gaming profits earned for the period of January 1, 2017 through March 31, 2020. It requires annual payments of approximately $


million for 2017 through 2019 and a payment of approximately $

300,000

for the first quarter 2020. The Company reversed, during 2018, $


million of deferred taxes previously recorded on 2017 earnings

that were not covered by an annual fee arrangement prior to the extension, resulting in a reduction in provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018, partially offset by the 2017 annual payment amount. MGM Grand Paradise has applied for an extension of the annual fee arrangement to cover distributions of gaming profits to be earned through June 26, 2022.

The Company has net operating losses in certain of the states in which it operates that total $


million as of December 31, 2019, which equates to deferred tax assets of $


million after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance. These net operating loss carryforwards will expire if not utilized by


through


. The Company has provided a valuation allowance of $


million on certain of its state deferred tax assets, including the net operating losses described above.

In addition, there is a valuation allowance of $


million on certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $


million on Hong Kong net operating losses because the Company believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition.


A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $


million and $


million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense, which were not material as of December 31, 2019, 2018 or 2017. The Company does not anticipate that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2019 will change materially within the next twelve months.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. As of December 31, 2019, the IRS can no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2014; however, the IRS may adjust NOLs generated in such years that were utilized in 2014. The Company’s 2014 U.S. consolidated federal income tax return is currently under examination by the IRS.

As of December 31, 2019, other than adjustments resulting from the federal income tax audits discussed above, the various state and local tax jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns can no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2014. However, such jurisdictions may adjust NOLs generated in such years that are utilized in subsequent years. The Company’s state income tax returns filed in Michigan for the tax years 2014 through 2017 are currently under examination and the Company was recently notified that the 2018 tax year will be included in the examination as well. In addition, the State of New Jersey recently opened an audit of one of the Company’s subsidiaries, Marina District Development Company, LLC, for the tax years 2015 through 2018. The examinations of the Company’s state income tax returns filed in Mississippi and New Jersey for the tax years 2014 through 2016 were completed during 2019 resulting in no material audit adjustments. No other state or local income tax returns are currently under examination.

NOTE 11 – LEASES

The Company leases the land underlying certain of its properties, real estate, and various equipment under operating and, to a lesser extent, finance lease arrangements. The master lease agreement with MGP is eliminated in consolidation and, accordingly is not included within the disclosures below; refer to Note 18 for further discussion of the master lease with MGP.

Land.

The Company is a lessee of land underlying Borgata, MGM National Harbor, and Beau Rivage. The Company is obligated to make lease payments through the non-cancelable term of the ground leases, which is through 2066 for Beau Rivage, through 2070 for Borgata, and through 2082 for MGM National Harbor.  Additionally, the Company has MGM Macau and MGM Cotai land concession contracts, each with an initial


-year

contract term ending in

April 2031

and

January 2038

, respectively.  The Company’s land leases are classified as operating leases.

Bellagio real estate assets.

Pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and the Bellagio BREIT Venture,

the Company leases the real estate assets of Bellagio from the Bellagio BREIT venture.

The Bellagio lease has an initial term of


years with two subsequent

ten-year

renewal periods, exercisable at the Company’s option.

The lease provides for initial annual rent of $


million with a fixed


% escalator for the first ten years and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of


% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of


% during the 11th through 20th years and


% thereafter. The Company does not consider the renewal options reasonably certain of being exercised and, accordingly, has determined the lease term to be 30 years. In consideration of such, Company determined that the expected lease term of 30 years to be less than


% of the economic useful live of the real estate assets of Bellagio. Further, the Bellagio BREIT Venture provided its implicit rate to the Company, with which the Company determined that the present value of the future lease payments is less than


% of the fair market value of the Bellagio real estate assets.  Accordingly, in consideration of these lease classification tests as well as that the lease does not transfer ownership of the assets back to the Company at the end of the lease term or grant the Company a purchase option and the real estate assets have alternative uses at the end of the lease term,  the Company classified Bellagio lease as an operating lease.


Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas real estate assets.

In February 2020, the Company entered into

a lease with

MGP BREIT Venture

for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas

. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion.

The Company is still assessing the accounting treatment for this subsequent event, including that of the lease agreement.

Other information.

Components of lease costs and other information related to the Company’s leases was as follows for the year ended December 31, 2019:


Maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:

NOTE 12 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

October 1 litigation.

The Company and/or certain of its subsidiaries were named as defendants in a number of lawsuits related to the October 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. The matters involve in large degree the same legal and factual issues, each case being filed on behalf of individuals who are seeking damages for emotional distress, physical injury, medical expenses, economic damages and/or wrongful death. Lawsuits were first filed in October 2017 and include actions originally filed in the District Court of Clark County, Nevada and in the Superior Court of Los Angeles County, California. In June 2018, the Company removed to federal court all actions that remained pending in California and Nevada state courts. The Company also initiated declaratory relief actions in federal courts in various districts against individuals who had sued or stated an intent to sue

.

In connection with the mediation of these matters, the Company and law firms representing plaintiffs in the majority of pending matters and purporting to represent substantially all claimants known to the Company (collectively, the “Claimants”) have entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) whereby, subject to the satisfaction of certain monetary and non-monetary conditions, the Company’s insurance carriers will deposit funds into a settlement fund covering the plaintiffs and certain other cases that emerged or were filed prior to October 1, 2019. Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company expects that the total amount placed in the fund to be between $


million and $


million, subject to and depending on obtaining a minimum level of participation with escalators based on greater participation increasing the amount payable up to $


million in the event of


% participation by certain categories of claimants, as defined in the Settlement Agreement. The Company has $


million of insurance coverage available to fund. Following the mediation a few additional lawsuits were filed against the Company and/or certain of its subsidiaries. While it is possible that these lawsuits may be resolved as part of the Settlement Agreement, no assurances can be made that they will be included. Although the Company continues to believe it is not legally responsible for the perpetrator’s criminal acts, in the interest of avoiding protracted litigation and the related impact on the community, the Company believed it was in the best interests of all parties involved to negotiate and enter into the Settlement Agreement. As a result of the foregoing, the Company believes that it is probable a loss will be incurred and, as of December 31, 2019, the Company accrued a liability of $


million, which represents the low end of the range of probable loss. In addition, the Company recorded an insurance receivable of $


million, which represents the entire amount of the liability recorded for the settlement of these cases. While the Company intends for substantially all claimants to be covered by the Settlement Agreement, it remains possible that certain claimants may not join the settlement. In addition, no assurances can be given that the significant conditions to the Settlement Agreement will be satisfied by the Claimants

.


If the conditions in the Settlement Agreement are not satisfied and the mediation stay is lifted, the Company is currently unable to reliably predict the future developments in, outcome of, and economic costs and other consequences of any such litigation related to this matter. The Company will continue to investigate the factual and legal defenses, and evaluate these matters based on subsequent events, new information and future circumstances. The Company intends to defend against any such lawsuits and believes it ultimately should prevail, but litigation of this type is inherently unpredictable. Although there are significant procedural, factual and legal issues to be resolved that could significantly affect the Company’s belief as to the possibility of liability, the Company currently believes that it is reasonably possible that it could incur liability in connection with certain of these lawsuits. The foregoing determination was made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, as codified in ASC 450-20, and is not an admission of any liability on the part of the Company or any of its affiliates. Given that these cases would be in the early stages, and in light of the uncertainties surrounding them, the Company does not currently possess sufficient information to determine a range of reasonably possible liability. The insurance carriers have not expressed a reservation of rights or coverage defense that affects the Company’s evaluation of potential losses in connection with these claims. The Company’s general liability insurance coverage provides, as part of the contractual “duty to defend”, payment of legal fees and associated costs incurred to defend covered lawsuits that are filed arising from the October 1, 2017 shooting in Las Vegas. Payment of such fees and costs is in addition to (and not limited by) the limits of the insurance policies and does not erode the total liability coverage available.

Other litigation

.

The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to its business. Management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows

.

Borgata property tax reimbursement agreement.

In 2017, Borgata was reimbursed $


million as settlement for property tax refunds in satisfaction of New Jersey Tax Court and Superior Court judgments of pending tax appeals. The Company recorded the amounts received as an offset to general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. As required by the agreement to acquire Borgata from Boyd Gaming in August 2016, the Company paid Boyd Gaming half of the settlement amount received by the Company, net of fees and expenses, which was recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.

Other guarantees.

The Company and its subsidiaries are party to various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of credit issued by financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to $


million and the Operating Partnership’s senior credit facility limits the amount to $


million. At December 31, 2019, $


million in letters of credit were outstanding under the Company’s senior credit facility.

No

letters of credit were outstanding under the Operating Partnership’s senior credit facility at December 31, 2019. The amount of available borrowings under each of the credit facilities is reduced by any outstanding letters of credit.

In connection with the Extension Agreement, MGM Grand Paradise provided a bank guarantee in an amount of approximately $


million (when giving effect to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations) to the government of Macau in May 2019 to warrant the fulfillment of labor debts upon the expiration of the Extension Agreement in June 2022.

Additionally, the Company provides a guarantee of the $

3.01

billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon) of Bellagio BREIT Venture, which matures in 2029. The terms of the guarantee provide that after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the indebtedness, the Company would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral, which is the real estate assets of Bellagio owned by Bellagio BREIT Venture, and the debt obligation. This guarantee is accounted for under ASC 460 at fair value; such value is immaterial.

In connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the Company provides a guarantee of the $

3.0

billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon) of MGP BREIT Venture, which has an initial term of twelve years, maturing in 2032, with an anticipated repayment date of March 2030. The terms of the guarantee provide that after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the indebtedness, the Company would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral, which is the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas, owned by MGP BREIT Venture, and the debt obligation. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion on this subsequent event.

Repurchases of common stock may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be repurchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The timing, volume and nature of stock repurchases will be at the sole discretion of management, dependent on market conditions, applicable securities laws, and other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased approximately

Recognition of compensation cost.

Compensation cost was recognized as follows:

NOTE 15 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Multiemployer benefit plans.

The Company currently participates in multiemployer pension plans in which the risks of participating differs from single-employer plans in the following aspects:

a)

Assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers;

b)

If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers;

c)

If an entity chooses to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans, the entity may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability; and

d)

If the plan is terminated by withdrawal of all employers and if the value of the nonforfeitable benefits exceeds plan assets and withdrawal liability payments, employers are required by law to make up the insufficient difference.


The Company’s participation in these plans is presented below.

(1)

The Company was listed in the plan's Form 5500 as providing more than


%

of the total contributions for the plan years 2018 and 2017 for the Southern Nevada Culinary and Bartenders Pension Plan and for the plan year 2018 for the UHF. At the date the financial statements were issued, Form 5500 was not available for the plan year 2019.

(2)

The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan and is certified by the plan's actuary. Plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded (critical status) and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded.

(3)

Indicates plans for which a Financial Improvement Plan (FIP) or a Rehabilitation Plan (RP) is either pending or has been implemented.

(4)

There have been no significant changes that affect the comparability of contributions.

(5)

The Company is party to

twelve

collective bargaining agreements (CBA) that require contributions with the Local Joint Executive Board of Las Vegas, which is made up of the Culinary Workers Union and Bartenders Union. The agreements between Aria, Bellagio, Mandalay Bay, and MGM Grand Las Vegas are the most significant because more than half of the Company’s employee participants in this plan are covered by those

four

agreements.

(6)

Effective January 1, 2018, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation approved the spin-off of the UNITE HERE portion of the Legacy Plan of the National Retirement Fund (NRF) to the newly formed UHF. As a result of the spin-off, the pension liabilities as well as certain assets of the plan were transferred to the new plan. The terms of the UHF plan are identical to the NRF plan.

(7)

The Company intends to extend the agreement past the expiration date until a new agreement is executed.

Multiemployer benefit plans other than pensions

. Pursuant to its collective bargaining agreements referenced above, the Company also contributes to UNITE HERE Health (the “Health Fund”), which provides healthcare benefits to its active and retired members. The Company contributed $


million, $


million, and $


million to the Health Fund in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

Self-insurance.

The Company is self-insured for most health care benefits and workers compensation for its non-union employees. The liability for self-insurance was $


million and $


million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is included in “Other accrued liabilities” and “Other long-term obligations.”

NOTE 16 — PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS, NET

Property transactions, net consisted of the following:

Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land.

In December 2019, the Company completed the previously announced sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and the adjacent land for $


million, which consisted of $

662.5

million paid in cash and a secured note due 2024 with a face value of $

162.5

million and fair value of $

133.7

million. The note has a stated interest rate of


% for the first two years,


% for following two years, and

4.5

% for the fifth year and is secured by the borrower with the land adjacent to Circus Circus Las Vegas as collateral with an effective interest rate of

7.31

%. The interest on the note, which is comprised of the stated interest and the discount on the note, will amortize into interest income using the effective interest method over the length of the agreement.


During the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $


million, which reflects the amount by which the assets’ carrying value exceeds the assets’ fair value (expected selling price). We further recognized a loss of $


million during the fourth quarter of 2019 primarily relating to selling costs. The assets and liabilities of Circus Circus Las Vegas and the adjacent land sold of $


million and $


million, respectively, primarily consisted of property and equipment, net of $


million. Circus Circus Las Vegas is not classified as discontinued operations because the Company concluded that the sale is not a strategic shift that has a major effect on the Company’s operations or its financial results and it does not represent a major geographic segment or product line.

Grand Victoria investment sale.

NOTE 17 — SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Company’s management views each of its casino resorts as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, the regulatory environments in which they operate, and their management and reporting structure. The Company has aggregated its operating segments into the following reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts.

Las Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York (including the Park), Excalibur, Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas (until the sale of such property in December 2019).

Regional Operations.

Regional Operations consists of the following casino resorts: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York (upon acquisition in January 2019); and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio (upon MGM’s acquisition of the operations from MGP in April 2019).

MGM China.

MGM China consists of MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.

The Company’s operations related to investments in unconsolidated affiliates, MGM Northfield Park (prior to April 1, 2019 as the operations were owned by MGP until that date), and certain other corporate operations and management services have not been identified as separate reportable segments; therefore, these operations are included in “Corporate and other” in the following segment disclosures to reconcile to consolidated results.

In 2019, the Company changed its segment measure of profit and loss from Adjusted Property EBITDA to Adjusted Property EBITDAR. As discussed in Note 2, prior to the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, the master lease between subsidiaries of the Company and MGP was accounted for as a failed sale of the real estate assets due to the subsidiaries’ investments in the Operating Partnership, which constituted continuing involvement. As such, the real estate assets were reflected in the balance sheets of the applicable MGM subsidiaries as well as the associated finance lease liability. In connection with the adoption of ASC 842, the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets under the master lease now qualify as a passed sale and are determined to be operating leases. Accordingly, the real estate assets are now only reflected on the balance sheet of MGP and the MGM subsidiaries have recorded operating lease liabilities and operating ROU assets and also now record rent expense instead of depreciation and interest expense. The master lease and its related accounting eliminates in consolidation. Further, as a result of the Bellagio transaction in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company records rent expense associated with the triple-net operating lease with Bellagio BREIT Venture. In order to present profit and loss of each reportable segment on a similar economic basis, the rent expense associated with the triple net operating leases and ground leases is added back within the financial information reviewed by the chief operating decision maker and as presented below, including recasting of prior year periods.

Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as Adjusted EBITDAR before corporate expense and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and before rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminates in consolidation. Adjusted EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, gain on Bellagio transaction, restructuring costs (which represents costs related to severance, accelerated stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan), rent expense associated with triple net operating and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in REITs, NV Energy exit expense, and property transactions, net.


The following tables present the Company’s segment information:


Total assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations or when determining the allocation of resources and, accordingly, are not presented.

Long-lived assets, which includes property and equipment, net, operating and finance lease right-of-use assets, net, goodwill, and other intangibles, net, presented by geographic region in which the Company holds assets are presented below:

NOTE 18 — RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

MGM China

Ms. Ho, Pansy Catilina Chiu King (“Ms. Ho”) is a member of the Board of Directors of, and holds a minority ownership interest in, MGM China. Ms. Ho is also the managing director of Shun Tak Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries “Shun Tak”), a leading conglomerate in Hong Kong with core businesses in transportation, property, hospitality and investments. Shun Tak provides various services and products, including ferry tickets, travel products, rental of hotel rooms, laundry services and property cleaning services to MGM China. In addition, MGM China leases transportation equipment and office space from Shun Tak. MGM China incurred expenses relating to Shun Tak of $


million, $


million and $

Grand Paradise Macau deferred cash payment.

On September 1, 2016, the Company purchased

188.1

million common shares of its MGM China subsidiary from Grand Paradise Macau (“GPM”), an entity controlled by Ms. Ho. As part of the consideration for the purchase, the Company agreed to pay GPM or its nominee a deferred cash payment of $


million, which will be paid in amounts equal to the ordinary dividends received on such shares, with a final lump sum payment due on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the transaction if any portion of the deferred cash payment remains unpaid at that time. Such amount was paid to Expert Angles Limited, an entity controlled by Ms. Ho through November 2018 and subsequently controlled by an immediate family member of Ms. Ho. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded a remaining liability on a discounted basis of $


million and $


million in “Other long-term obligations

”, respectively.


MGM Branding and Development Holdings, Ltd. (together with its subsidiary MGM Development Services, Ltd., “MGM Branding and Development”), an entity included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements in which Ms. Ho indirectly holds a noncontrolling interest, is party to a brand license agreement and a development services agreement with MGM China, for which the related amounts are eliminated in consolidation. An entity owned by Ms. Ho received distributions of $


million, $


million and $


million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, in connection with the ownership of a noncontrolling interest in MGM Branding and Development Holdings, Ltd.

MGP

As further described in Note 1, pursuant to the master lease with MGP, the Company leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor and MGM Northfield Park from MGP.

MGP master lease.

The MGP master lease has an initial lease term of

ten years

that began on April 25, 2016 (other than with respect to MGM National Harbor, as described below) with the potential to extend the term for

four

additional

five-year

terms thereafter at the option of the Company. The MGP master lease provides that any extension of its term must apply to all of the real estate under the master lease at the time of the extension. The MGP master lease provides that the initial term with respect to MGM National Harbor ends on April 31, 2024. Thereafter, the initial term of the MGP master lease with respect to MGM National Harbor may be renewed at the option of the Company for an initial renewal period lasting until the earlier of the end of the then-current term of the master lease or the next renewal term (depending on whether the Company elects to renew the other properties under the master lease in connection with the expiration of the initial ten-year term). If, however, the Company chooses not to renew the lease with respect to MGM National Harbor after the initial MGM National Harbor term under the master lease, the Company would also lose the right to renew the MGP master lease with respect to the rest of the properties when the initial ten-year lease term ends related to the rest of the properties in 2026. The MGP master lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the Company to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the base rent. Additionally, the master lease provides MGP with a right of first offer with respect to MGM Springfield and with respect to any further gaming development by the Company on the undeveloped land adjacent to Empire City, which MGP may exercise should the Company elect to sell either property in the future.

Rent under the MGP master lease consists of a “base rent” component and a “percentage rent” component. As of December 31, 2019, the base rent represents approximately


% of the rent payments due and the percentage rent represents approximately


% of the rent payments due under the MGP master lease.

The MGP master lease also provides for fixed annual escalators of


% on the base rent through the sixth lease year and

the possibility for additional


% increases thereafter subject to the Company meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as well as potential increases in percentage rent in year six and every five years thereafter based on a percentage of average actual annual net revenue during the preceding five year period calculated in accordance with the terms under the master lease

.

The MGP master lease also contains customary events of default and financial covenants. The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2019.

Subsequent to the Company completing its acquisition of Empire City in January 2019, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from the Company for consideration of approximately $


million, which included the assumption of debt of approximately $


million, which was immediately repaid, and the remaining paid through the issuance of Operating Partnership units. The real estate assets of Empire City were then leased to the Company pursuant to an amendment to the MGP master lease, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $


million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent with the MGP master lease terms,


% of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at


% per year until 2022. As disclosed above, the master lease provides MGP with a right of first offer with respect to certain undeveloped land adjacent to the property to the extent the Company develops additional gaming facilities, which MGP may exercise should the Company elect to sell this property in the future.

On March 7, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the existing MGP master lease with respect to investments made by the Company related to the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Lease Transaction”). In connection with the transaction, the Company received consideration of $


million, of which approximately $


million was paid in cash and the remaining paid through the issuance of Operating Partnership units. Additionally, the annual rent payment to MGP was increased by $


million, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent with the master lease terms,


% of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at


% per year until 2022.

Additionally, on April 1, 2019, the Company acquired the membership interests of Northfield from MGP, which held the operations of Northfield, for fair value of consideration of approximately $


million consisting primarily of approximately


million Operating Partnership units that were ultimately redeemed by the Operating Partnership, and MGP retained the associated real estate assets. The Company then rebranded the property to MGM Northfield Park, which was then added to the existing MGP master lease with MGP, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $


million. Consistent with the master lease terms,


% of this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at


% per year until 2022.


The annual rent payments under the MGP master lease for the fourth lease year, which commenced on April 1, 2019, increased to $


million from $


million at the start of the third lease year. The increase was a result of the $


million in additional rent for each of the Park MGM Transaction and the addition of Empire City in the beginning of 2019, the $


million of additional rent for MGM Northfield Park, which entered the Master Lease on April 1, 2019, as well as the third

2.0

% fixed annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2019.

On February 14, 2020, the Company amended the MGP master lease to remove Mandalay Bay from such master lease and the rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $


million.  Refer to Note 1 for further discussion.

All intercompany transactions, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in the Company’s consolidation of MGP. The public ownership of MGP’s Class A shares is recognized as non-controlling interests in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Bellagio BREIT Venture

The Company has a


% ownership interest in the Bellagio BREIT Venture which owns the Bellagio real estate assets and leased back such assets to a subsidiary of the Company pursuant to a lease agreement. Refer to Note 11 for further information related to the Bellagio lease.

MGP BREIT Venture

On February 14, 2020, the Company entered into a lease with the MGP BREIT Venture, in which MGP has a

50.1

% ownership interest.  Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of this subsequent event.

NOTE 19 —CONDENSED CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL INFORMATION

As of December 31, 2019, all of the Company’s principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of its material domestic subsidiaries, other than MGP and the Operating Partnership, MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor, MGM Springfield, and each of their respective subsidiaries. The Company’s international subsidiaries, including MGM China and its subsidiaries, are not guarantors of such indebtedness. Separate condensed financial statement information for the subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantors as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, are presented below. Within the Condensed Consolidating Statements of Cash Flows, the Company has presented net changes in intercompany accounts as investing activities if the applicable entities have a net asset in intercompany accounts and as a financing activity if the applicable entities have a net intercompany liability balance.

Certain of the Company’s subsidiaries collectively own Operating Partnership units and each subsidiary accounts for its respective investment under the equity method within the condensed consolidating financial information presented below. Prior to the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, for these subsidiaries, such investment constituted continuing involvement, and accordingly, the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets under the MGP master lease did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting. The real estate assets were reflected in the balance sheets of the applicable MGM subsidiaries. In addition, such subsidiaries recognized finance liabilities within “Other long-term obligations” related to rent payments due under the MGP master lease and recognized the related interest expense component of such payments. These real estate assets were also reflected on the balance sheet of the MGP subsidiary that received such assets. The condensed consolidating financial information presented below therefore included the accounting for such activity within the respective columns presented and in the elimination column. In connection with the adoption of ASC 842, the sale and leaseback of the real estate assets under the MGP master lease now qualify as a passed sale and are determined to be operating leases.  As such, the real estate assets, finance liabilities, and related interest expense component of rent payments are no longer reflected in the results of the applicable MGM subsidiaries.  Instead, the real estate assets are now only reflected on the balance sheet of the MGP subsidiary that received such assets and the MGM subsidiaries have recorded operating lease liabilities and operating ROU assets with the related rent expense reflected within “general and administrative” expense within the condensed consolidating financial information
