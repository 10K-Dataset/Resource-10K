Las Vegas Strip Resorts

Bellagio

Bellagio is an elegant European-style luxury resort located on an approximately
80-acre site with 1,450 feet of frontage at the center of the Las Vegas Strip. The
resort overlooks an eight-acre lake. Each day, more than 1,000 fountains in the lake
come alive at regular intervals in a choreographed ballet of water, music and lights.
Bellagio features award-winning casual and gourmet restaurants, including the
world-famous Le Cirque, Olives, Michael Mina and Picasso restaurants; upscale retail
boutiques, including those leased to Armani, Chanel, Gucci, Prada and Tiffany & Co.; and
extensive meeting, convention and banquet space. Bellagio’s specially designed theatre
is home to the spectacular show

“O”

produced and performed by the talented Cirque du
Soleil organization. Bellagio also offers Light, an upscale nightclub, Caramel, a
sophisticated lounge and nightclub, as well as several other bars and lounges. The
Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art features rotating exhibitions of original masterpieces from
museums and private collections. The surroundings of Bellagio are lushly landscaped
with classical gardens and European fountains and pools. Inside, a botanical
conservatory is filled with vibrant colors and pleasing scents that change with the
seasons. Bellagio has received the prestigious Five Diamond award from AAA for the last
four years, as has Picasso. Le Cirque has also earned the award for the last two years.

We recently expanded Bellagio. In December 2004, we opened a new 928-room tower
and an expanded spa and salon. In addition, we added retail and meeting space and
Sensi, a new restaurant featuring multiple exhibition kitchens. In 2005, we will open
an expanded poker room, upgrade the fountain show and remodel many of the common areas
of Bellagio.

MGM Grand Las Vegas

MGM
Grand Las Vegas is a destination resort located on approximately 113 acres,
with over 350 feet of frontage on the Las Vegas Strip and 1,450 feet of frontage on
Tropicana Avenue. MGM Grand Las Vegas includes the Mansion, an exclusive enclave
featuring a collection of exquisite suites and a private dining room catering to our
premium gaming customers. MGM Grand Las Vegas features an extensive array of
restaurants, including Craftsteak, by the James Beard award-winning chef Tom Colicchio,
NOBHILL and SeaBlue by Michael Mina, Pearl, Shibuya, Diego, and Fiamma Trattoria. Other
amenities include the Studio 54 nightclub, Tabu, the Ultra Lounge, Teatro, numerous
retail shopping outlets, a 380,000 square foot state-of-the-art conference center, and
an extensive pool and spa complex.

Entertainment options at MGM Grand Las Vegas include

KÀ

, the newest Cirque du
Soleil show performed in a custom designed theatre seating almost 2,000 guests; the Hollywood
Theatre, showcasing headliner entertainment; and La Femme. The MGM Grand Garden is a
special events center with a capacity of over 16,000 seats, and provides a venue for
concerts by such stars as Madonna, Cher, Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Billy Joel
and others, as well as championship boxing and other sporting events.

In 2002, we entered into an agreement with Turnberry Associates to develop luxury
condominium towers at MGM Grand Las Vegas. We initially contributed land to the project
for a 50% investment. Turnberry Associates contributed $9 million in cash and is
managing the development and sales process. The venture obtained construction financing
for the remainder of the estimated $210 million cost of the
first tower, which will feature 576 units. We will have
the opportunity to rent the condominiums to third parties on behalf of owners who elect
to have us do so. Based on market acceptance of the initial tower, we and Turnberry
Associates have commenced the sales phase for a second tower.

We recently completed the renovation of the 29

th

floor at MGM Grand Las
Vegas as the SKYLOFTS, featuring the ultimate in personal service for discerning guests
in two floor suites with the finest guest amenities. In 2005, we will open a poker room
and relocate the sports book in the renovated Dome Casino, and expand our Mansion casino
and add two new restaurants by world famous chef Joel Robuchon in the former sports book location.

The Mirage

The Mirage is a luxurious, tropically themed destination resort located on
approximately 100 acres, shared with TI, with 2,200 feet of combined Strip frontage near
the center of the Las Vegas Strip. The exterior of the resort is landscaped with palm
trees, abundant foliage and more than four acres of lagoons and other water features
centered around a 54-foot volcano and waterfall. Each evening, the volcano erupts at
regular intervals, with flames that spectacularly illuminate the front of the resort.
Inside the front entrance is an atrium with a tropical garden and additional water
features capped by a 100-foot-high glass dome, designed to replicate the sights, sounds
and fragrances of the South Seas. Located at the rear of the hotel, adjacent to the
swimming pool area, is a dolphin habitat featuring Atlantic bottlenose dolphins and

The
Secret Garden of Siegfried & Roy

, an attraction that allows guests to view the beautiful
exotic animals of Siegfried & Roy, the world-famous illusionists.



The Mirage features a wide array of restaurants, including the recently added
Cravings, the Adam Tihany designed buffet experience, and Carnegie Deli. Entertainment
at The Mirage includes a show featuring Danny Gans, the renowned singer/impersonator, in
The Danny Gans Theatre. The Mirage also has numerous retail shopping outlets and
170,000 square feet of convention space, including the 90,000-square foot Mirage Events
Center.

The Mirage is currently expanding and upgrading its amenities. In 2005, we will
construct a 18,000-square foot nightclub and add or renovate several restaurants. We
are also constructing a custom theatre for a new Cirque du Soleil production based on
the works of The Beatles, scheduled to open in 2006.

Treasure Island (“TI”)

TI is a Caribbean-themed resort located next to The Mirage. TI and The Mirage are
connected by a monorail. TI features several restaurants, including the recently
remodeled buffet Dishes, Isla Mexican Kitchen and Canter’s Deli. Bars and lounges at TI
include Mist and Tangerine, which features indoor/outdoor space with views of the Las
Vegas Strip and nightly burlesque entertainment. The showroom at TI features

Mystère

, a
unique choreographic mix of magic, special effects and feats of human prowess produced
and performed by Cirque du Soleil. The Sirens of TI Show is performed at the front of
the resort, providing a significant presence to visitors on the Las Vegas Strip and
beckoning visitors into TI. In recognition of its superior customer service and
facilities, TI has been awarded the Four Diamond rating by AAA. Construction is almost
complete on a new pedestrian bridge linking TI to the Fashion Show Mall, along with a
new north entrance to TI directly accessed by the pedestrian bridge.

New York-New York Hotel and Casino

New York-New York is a themed destination resort on the Las Vegas Strip at
Tropicana Avenue, covering approximately 20 acres. The architecture at New York-New
York replicates many of New York City’s landmark buildings and icons, including the
Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge and a
Coney Island-style roller coaster. The casino features highly themed interiors
including

Park Avenue

with retail shops, a

Central Park

setting in the central casino
area, and

Little Italy

with its traditional food court set inside a typical residential
neighborhood. New York-New York also features several restaurants and
numerous bars and lounges, including nationally recognized Coyote Ugly and ESPNZone and
Nine Fine Irishmen, an authentic Irish Pub. Entertainment includes

Zumanity

by Cirque
du Soleil and headline performer Rita Rudner. We recently remodeled all of the standard
rooms at New York-New York.

Monte Carlo Resort & Casino

Monte Carlo is located on approximately 46 acres with 600 feet of frontage on the
Las Vegas Strip, approximately one-half mile south of Bellagio. We own 50% of this
resort in a joint venture with Mandalay Resort Group, which manages the resort. Monte
Carlo has a palatial style reminiscent of the Belle Époque, the French Victorian
architecture of the late 19th century. The resort has amenities such as fine dining at
Andre’s, a brew pub featuring live entertainment, a health spa, a beauty salon, a
1,200-seat theatre featuring the world-renowned magician Lance
Burton, and a large pool area.

Boardwalk Hotel and Casino

Boardwalk is located between Bellagio and Monte Carlo on the Las Vegas Strip.
This facility includes 654 hotel rooms and 32,000 square feet of casino space. Other
amenities at Boardwalk include a coffee shop, a buffet, an entertainment lounge, a
gift shop, interior meeting space and two outdoor swimming pools. Boardwalk will be
closed within the next two years in order to begin construction of Project CityCenter.

Other Nevada Resorts

Primm Valley Resorts

Primm Valley Resorts consists of three hotel-casinos on both sides of Interstate 15
at the California/Nevada state line in Primm, Nevada (about 40 miles south of Las Vegas)
and the Primm Valley Golf Club nearby in California. Buffalo Bill’s Resort & Casino,
Primm Valley Resort & Casino, Whiskey Pete’s Hotel & Casino, Primm Valley Golf Club and
three gas stations including the Primm Center (collectively, the “Primm Valley Resorts”)
form a major destination location and offer visitors driving from California the first
opportunity to wager upon entering Nevada and the last opportunity before leaving.



Primm Valley Resorts offer an array of amenities and attractions, including a
25,000-square foot conference center, numerous owned and leased restaurants, and a
variety of amusement rides. The 6,100-seat Star of the Desert Arena hosts top-name
entertainers. Connected to Primm Valley Resorts is the Fashion Outlet of Las Vegas, a
shopping mall containing approximately 400,000 square feet of retail space with over 100
retail outlet stores. The Fashion Outlet is owned and operated by a third party.

Golf Resorts

We own and operate an exclusive world-class golf course, Shadow Creek, located
approximately ten miles north of our Las Vegas Strip resorts. Shadow Creek is ranked

th

in Golf Digest’s ranking of America’s 100 Greatest Public Courses. We
also own and operate the Primm Valley Golf Club, located four miles south of Primm in
California, which includes two 18-hole championship courses. All of these golf courses
were designed by renowned golf course architect Tom Fazio.

Other Resorts

MGM Grand Detroit

MGM Grand Detroit is our interim casino facility in Detroit, Michigan. The
facility’s interior is decorated in an Art Deco motif with themed bars, a VIP lounge and
several restaurants, including our signature upscale restaurant, the Hollywood Brown
Derby. The site is conveniently located off the Howard Street exit from the John C.
Lodge Expressway in downtown Detroit, and has parking for over 3,000 vehicles in two
parking garages and additional on-site covered parking.

Beau Rivage

Beau Rivage is a luxurious beachfront resort located on a 41-acre site with 1,400
feet of frontage where Interstate 110 meets the Gulf Coast in Biloxi, Mississippi. The
graceful driveway leading to Beau Rivage is lined with intricate gardens and stately oak
trees and large trees fill the resort’s skylit atrium lobby. Distinctive restaurants
offer a variety of dining experiences, including a café nestled in the atrium gardens,
Port House, a steak and seafood restaurant surrounded by tropical fish and coral reefs,
and Mikado, featuring creative and contemporary Asian cuisine. Adjoining its lavish
health spa and salon is a lushly landscaped swimming pool and café overlooking the Gulf
of Mexico. Beau Rivage also offers a state-of-the-art convention center, a shopping
esplanade, a 1,600-seat theatre and a brew pub with live entertainment. Beau Rivage is
rated as a Four Diamond resort by AAA. We have begun construction on a world-class golf
course, Fallen Oak, designed by Tom Fazio, to be located approximately 20 minutes from
the resort.

Borgata

The Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa is located on 29 acres at Renaissance Pointe in
Atlantic City, New Jersey and opened July 3, 2003. In addition to its 2,000 guest rooms
and suites and extensive gaming floor, Borgata includes several specialty restaurants,
retail shops, a European-style health spa, meeting space and unique entertainment
venues. Borgata is the first new casino in Atlantic City in over 13 years. We own 50%
of the limited liability company that owns Borgata. Boyd Gaming Corporation owns the
other 50% and also operates the resort.

Borgata is currently expanding its gaming and non-gaming amenities, adding 36
casino table games and 600 slot machines, along with additional restaurant,
entertainment and other amenities. This project is expected to be completed in 2006.
Additionally, Borgata has plans to add another hotel tower featuring 800 guestrooms,
suites and resort condominiums, along with a new spa, parking garage and meeting rooms.
This project is expected to be completed in 2007. Neither project is expected to
require contributions from us, as existing operating cash flow and Borgata’s recently
renegotiated bank credit facility is anticipated to provide for the cost of the expansions.

Mandalay Resort Group

On June 16, 2004, we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger
agreement with Mandalay Resort Group (“Mandalay”), a publicly traded company, under
which we will acquire Mandalay for $71.00 in cash for each share of common stock of
Mandalay. Mandalay owns and operates eleven properties in Nevada, owns and operates
Gold Strike, a hotel/casino in Tunica County, Mississippi, owns a 50% interest in Silver
Legacy in Reno, a 50% interest in Monte Carlo in Las Vegas, a 50% interest in Grand
Victoria, a riverboat in Elgin, Illinois, and a 53.5% interest in
MotorCity Casino in Detroit,
Michigan.



The total consideration is approximately $8.1 billion, including equity value of
approximately $4.8 billion, convertible debentures with a redemption value of
approximately $574 million, the assumption or repayment of other outstanding Mandalay
debt with a fair value of approximately $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2004, and $100
million of estimated transaction costs. The transaction is structured as a merger of
one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into Mandalay. The transaction will be
accounted for as a purchase and is anticipated to close during the first quarter of
2005, subject to the disposition of one of the Detroit casinos and
addressing Illinois regulatory matters regarding Mandalay’s
ownership interest in Grand Victoria.

As of January 31, 2005, Mandalay’s resorts (including Monte Carlo) included over
35,000 hotel rooms and offered almost 900 table games and over 22,000 slot machines in
nearly 1.1 billion square feet of casino space.

Future Development

Project CityCenter

In November 2004, we announced a plan to develop a multi-billion dollar urban
metropolis, initially called Project CityCenter, on 66 acres of land on the Las Vegas
Strip, between Bellagio and Monte Carlo. We anticipate that the first phase of Project
CityCenter will include a 4,000-room casino resort, three 400-room boutique hotels,
approximately 550,000 square feet of retail shops, dining and entertainment venues, and
1,650 units of luxury condominium, hotel/condominium and private residence clubs.

We expect that the complete design work for Project CityCenter will take 18 months
and that the first phase will open in 2009. The design, budget and schedule of Project
CityCenter are still preliminary however, and the ultimate timing, cost and scope of
Project CityCenter are subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects.

Atlantic City, New Jersey

We own approximately 130 acres on Renaissance Pointe in Atlantic City, New Jersey.
In addition, Borgata occupies 29 acres at Renaissance Pointe,
including 27 acres it owns and two acres we lease to Borgata. Of the remaining land,
approximately 95 acres are suitable for development, and a portion of these acres
consists of common roads, landscaping and master plan improvements which we designed and
developed as required by our agreement with Boyd.

In October 2002, we announced the suspension of our development activities on our
wholly-owned project on the Renaissance Pointe land in Atlantic City. We must apply for
and receive numerous governmental permits and satisfy other conditions before
construction of a new resort on the Renaissance Pointe site could begin. No assurance
can be given that we will develop a casino resort in New Jersey, or its ultimate
schedule, size, configuration or cost if we do develop a casino resort.

Detroit, Michigan

The Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act provides that not more than three
casinos may be licensed at any one time by the State of Michigan and that they be
located only in the City of Detroit. In November 1997, MGM Grand Detroit, LLC was
selected to develop one of the three authorized hotel-casino complexes. MGM Grand
Detroit, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, holds a controlling interest in MGM Grand
Detroit, LLC. A minority interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is held by Partners
Detroit, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company owned by residents and entities
located in the Detroit metropolitan area.

MGM Grand Detroit, LLC has operated an interim casino facility in downtown Detroit
since July 1999. In August 2002 the Detroit City Council approved revised development
agreements with our subsidiary and two other developers. The revised development agreement released
us and the City from certain of the obligations under the original agreement and
significantly changed other provisions of the original agreement.



We are currently in the process of obtaining land and developing plans for the
permanent facility. The design, budget and schedule of the permanent facility are not
finalized, and the ultimate timing, cost and scope of the facility are subject to risks
attendant to large-scale projects. The ability to construct the permanent casino
facility is currently subject to resolution of the Lac Vieux litigation – see “Item 3.
Legal Proceedings”.  The 6

th

Circuit Court of Appeals has issued an injunction, pending appeal, prohibiting the City
and the developers from commencing construction pending further action of the

th

Circuit Court. Therefore, we do not know when we will be able to
commence construction of, or complete, the permanent facility.

United Kingdom

In anticipation of reforms to gambling legislation currently before the United
Kingdom’s House of Parliament, we have entered into several strategic agreements in the
United Kingdom, including the following:

In May 2003, we purchased a 25% interest in Metro Casinos Limited, which was
developing a new casino in Bristol. Metro Casinos Limited is a subsidiary of R J Bown
(Holdings) Ltd, the owner of the Westcliff Casino, one of the largest United Kingdom
provincial casinos. We received regulatory approval for our investment in Metro Casinos
Limited from the Gaming Board for Great Britain in November 2003. The Bristol facility
opened in February 2004.

In October 2003, we entered into an agreement with the Earls Court and Olympia
Group, which operates large exhibition and trade show facilities in London, to form a
jointly owned company. The entity would develop an entertainment and gaming facility,
which we would operate in space leased from the Earls Court and Olympia Group, to
complement the existing Olympia facilities. The agreement is subject to the
implementation of proposed gaming law reforms and a tax structure acceptable to us, and
obtaining required planning and other approvals. We own 82.5% of the entity.

In November 2003, we entered into an agreement with Newcastle United PLC to create
a 50-50 joint venture which would build a major new mixed-use development, including
casino development, on a site in Newcastle’s city centre adjacent to Newcastle United’s
football stadium. Newcastle United is one of the leading English Premier League
(Soccer) clubs. Construction of the complex is contingent upon the implementation of
proposed gaming law reforms and a tax structure acceptable to us, and obtaining required
planning and other approvals. Newcastle United PLC contributed the land to the joint
venture, and we made an equity investment and will develop and operate the complex, as
well as own the casino development in leased premises within the complex.

In February 2004, we announced an agreement in principle with The British Land
Company PLC whereby we would operate a casino in leased premises within a newly
developed leisure and entertainment complex adjacent to the Meadowhall Shopping Centre
in Sheffield. The agreement is subject to the implementation of proposed gaming law
reforms and a tax structure acceptable to us, and obtaining required planning and other
approvals.

Macau

In June 2004, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Pansy Ho Chiu-king to
develop, build and operate a hotel-casino resort in Macau S.A.R. The facility, which
will use the “MGM Grand” name, will be located on a prime waterfront site and will
include world-class resort amenities including a hotel, restaurants, entertainment
facilities, convention, retail and spa facilities in addition to a significant gaming
component. The agreement is subject to, among other things, the approval of the
government of Macau S.A.R. and other regulatory approvals as well as the entry into a
subconcession agreement with Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (SJM), the holder of one of the
existing concessions to operate a casino in Macau. The Company has committed to invest
up to $280 million in the entity in the form of capital contributions and shareholder
loans. The complete design, timing, cost and scope of the project are at a preliminary
stage and are subject to the risks attendant to large-scale projects.



New York Racing Association

We have an understanding with the New York Racing Association (“NYRA”) to manage
VLTs at NYRA’s Aqueduct horseracing facility in metropolitan New York. We would assist
in the development of the facility, including providing project financing, and would
manage the facility for a fee. Work was halted on the VLT facility in August 2003
pending the outcome of an investigation of certain aspects of NYRA’s operations by
Federal prosecutors. In December 2003, NYRA reached agreement with the Justice
Department whereby NYRA was indicted with prosecution deferred. NYRA agreed to pay a
fine and the indictment will be dismissed with prejudice upon NYRA implementing certain
reforms and otherwise complying with the terms of the agreement. Our participation is
subject to a definitive agreement, regulatory approvals and certain legislative changes
by the State of New York.

Other

We have recently agreed to form a joint venture with CapitaLand, a listed company
in Singapore, to pursue a gaming license in Singapore in the event that the government
elects to legalize casino gaming. We will own 60% of the joint venture.

We regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in both the
domestic and international markets. These opportunities may include the ownership,
management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada or in
states other than Nevada or outside of the United States. We may undertake these
opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.
Development and operation of any gaming facility in a new jurisdiction is subject to
many contingencies. Several of these contingencies are outside of our control and may
include the passage of appropriate gaming legislation, the issuance of necessary
permits, licenses and approvals, the availability of appropriate financing and the
satisfaction of other conditions. We cannot be sure that we will decide or be able to
proceed with any acquisition or expansion opportunities.

Marketing

All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours each day, every day of the year. We do
not consider our business to be particularly seasonal. We believe that the largest
portion of our Nevada customers live in Southern California, although other geographic
areas are also important.

The level of gaming activity at our casinos and the pricing of our resorts’ hotel
rooms are the most significant factors in determining our revenues and operating income.
In 2004, we generated slightly over half of our net revenues from gaming activities and
almost a quarter of our net revenues from room sales. We also receive a large amount
of revenues from food and beverage, entertainment and retail operations. Since we
believe that the number of walk-in customers also affects the success of all of our
casino resorts, we design our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other
hotels.

The principal segments of the Nevada and Mississippi gaming markets are leisure
travel, premium gaming customers, conventions, including small meetings and corporate
incentive programs, and tour and travel. Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage
appeal to the upper end of each market segment, balancing their business by using the
convention and tour and travel segments to fill the mid-week and off-peak periods. Our
marketing strategy for TI and New York-New York is aimed at attracting middle- to
upper-middle-income wagerers, largely from the leisure travel and, to a lesser extent,
the tour and travel segments. Boardwalk and Primm Valley Resorts appeal primarily to
middle-income customers attracted by room, food and beverage and entertainment prices
that are lower than those offered by the major Las Vegas hotel-casinos.

We utilize our world-class golf courses in marketing programs at our Las Vegas
Strip and other Nevada resorts. Our major Las Vegas casino resorts offer luxury suite
packages that include golf privileges at Shadow Creek. In connection with our marketing
activities, we also invite our premium casino customers to play Shadow Creek on a
complimentary basis. We use Primm Valley Golf Club for marketing purposes at our Las
Vegas and Primm resorts, including offering room and golf packages at special rates.

We believe Beau Rivage is the most luxurious hotel-casino on the Mississippi Gulf
Coast. Beau Rivage seeks to attract the most affluent customers in each market segment,
particularly those who live in major cities in the Southeast United
States, as well as customers residing
in the Gulf Coast region. MGM Grand Detroit markets primarily to customers within a
150-mile radius of Detroit. Its customers are attracted by its diverse gaming and
dining offerings, its convenient location and its ample onsite parking facilities.



We advertise on radio, television and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in
selected cities throughout the United States, as well as on the Internet and by direct
mail. We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major United
States and foreign cities. A key element of marketing to high-level wagerers is
personal contact by our marketing personnel. Direct marketing is also important in the
convention segment. We maintain internet websites which inform customers about our
resorts and allow our customers to reserve hotel rooms and make restaurant and show
reservations.

We utilize technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in gaming as well. Our
Players Club links seven of our United States resorts, and consolidates all slots and
table games activity for customers with a Players Club account. Customers qualify for
benefits at all of these resorts, regardless of where they play. We believe that our
Players Club enables us to more effectively market to our customers. Almost all of the
slot machines at our United States resorts operate with International Game Technology’s
EZ-Pay™ cashless gaming system. We believe that this system enhances the customer
experience and increases the revenue potential of our slot machines.

Issuance of Markers

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Bellagio,
MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize marker play
to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well.

We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue
collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These
collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing
with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency
notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation.
In Nevada, Mississippi and Michigan, amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid
are enforceable under state laws. All other states are required to enforce a judgment
for amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid, entered into in Nevada,
Mississippi or Michigan, pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United
States Constitution. Amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are not legally
enforceable in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers
may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. A significant portion
of our Company’s accounts receivable, for amounts unpaid resulting from markers which
are not collectible through banking channels, is owed by major casino customers from the
Far East. The collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors,
including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’
home countries.

Supervision of Gaming Activities

In connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos, we maintain
stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements. These audit and
cash controls include:

Competition

Las Vegas, Nevada

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete with a large number of other hotel-casinos in
the Las Vegas area, including major hotel-casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major
hotel-casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the
Strip, and several major facilities elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. According to the
Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, there were approximately 132,000 guestrooms
in Las Vegas at December 31, 2004, up from approximately 130,000 rooms at December 31,
2003. Las Vegas visitor volume was 37.4 million in 2004, a 5% increase from the 35.5
million reported for 2003. Additional new hotel-casinos and expansion projects at
existing Las Vegas hotel-casinos are under construction or have been proposed. In
addition, further expansion of Native American gaming in California is likely. We are
unable to determine to what extent increased competition will affect our future
operating results.



Primm, Nevada

The Primm Valley Resorts compete primarily with two hotel-casinos located 11 miles
north along Interstate 15 in Jean, Nevada and with the numerous other hotels and casinos
in the Las Vegas area, as well as Native American gaming facilities in Southern
California. Since many of our current customers stop at Primm as they are driving on
Interstate 15 to and from major casino-hotels located in Las Vegas, we believe that our
success at Primm is also favorably influenced by the popularity of the Las Vegas
resorts. The expansion of Native American gaming has already had an impact on our Primm
Valley Resorts, and the substantial expansion of Native American gaming facilities in
California, which is currently anticipated, could have a further adverse effect on the
Primm Valley Resorts.

Detroit, Michigan

MGM Grand Detroit competes in this market with two other interim casinos located in
Detroit, as well as a government-owned casino located nearby in Windsor, Ontario. There
are Native American casinos in Michigan, but none are near the Detroit metropolitan
area.

Biloxi, Mississippi

Beau Rivage competes with 11 other casinos in the Mississippi Gulf Coast market,
nine of which offer hotel accommodations. Gulf Coast casinos also compete in the
regional market with a land-based casino in New Orleans and a land-based Native American
hotel-casino in central Mississippi. Casinos in the Gulf Coast market also compete for
the south Florida market with casinos in the Bahamas. Gulf Coast casinos compete to a
lesser extent with a number of casinos in Mississippi and Louisiana.

Other

Our Company’s facilities also compete for gaming customers with hotel-casino
operations located in other areas of the United States and other parts of the world, and
for vacationers with non-gaming tourist destinations such as Hawaii, Florida and cruise
ships. Our hotel-casinos compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries,
off-track wagering, card parlors, and other forms of legalized gaming in the United
States. In recent years, certain states have legalized, and several other states have
considered legalizing, casino gaming. We do not believe that legalization or expansion
of casino gaming in those jurisdictions would have a material adverse impact on our
operations. However, we do believe that the legalization of large-scale land-based
casino gaming in or near certain major metropolitan areas, particularly in California,
could have a material adverse effect on the Las Vegas market.

How We Compete

Our major casino resorts compete on the basis of:

The principal negative factors relating to our competitive position are:

•

Our limited geographic diversification (our major resorts are concentrated
on the Las Vegas Strip and some of our largest competitors operate in more
gaming markets than we do);

•

There are a number of gaming facilities located closer to where our
customers live than our resorts;

•

Our guestroom, dining and entertainment prices are often higher than those
of most of our competitors in each market, although we believe that the
quality of our facilities and services is also higher; and

•

Our hotel-casinos compete to some extent with each other for customers.
Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage, in particular, compete for some
of the same high-end customers.



Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2004, we had approximately 33,000 full-time and 7,000 part-time
employees. At that date, we had collective bargaining contracts with unions covering
approximately 16,000 of our employees. We do not have union contracts at Beau Rivage or
Boardwalk. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Regulation and Licensing

Nevada Government Regulation

The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in Clark County, Nevada are
subject to: (i) the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder
(collectively, the “Nevada Act”); and (ii) various local regulations. The Company’s
gaming operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada
Gaming Commission (the “Nevada Commission”), the Nevada State Gaming Control Board (the
“Nevada Board”) and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board (the “CCLGLB”).
The Nevada Commission, the Nevada Board, and the CCLGLB are collectively referred to as
the “Nevada Gaming Authorities.”

The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities
are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other
things: (i) the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or
indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; (ii) the establishment
and maintenance of responsible accounting practices of licensees, including the
establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of
assets and revenues; (iii) providing reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of
periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities; (iv) the prevention of cheating and
fraudulent practices; and (v) providing a source of state and local revenues through
taxation and licensing fees. Any change in such laws, regulations and procedures could
have an adverse effect on the Company’s gaming operations.

MGM Grand Hotel, LLC, dba MGM Grand Las Vegas, New York-New York Hotel & Casino,
LLC, dba New York-New York Hotel & Casino, The Primadonna Company, LLC, dba Primm Valley
Resort, Buffalo Bill’s and Whiskey Pete’s, THE MIRAGE CASINO-HOTEL, dba The Mirage,
Bellagio, LLC, dba Bellagio, Treasure Island Corp., dba Treasure Island at The Mirage,
Boardwalk Casino, Inc., dba Boardwalk Hotel and Casino, and Victoria Partners, dba Monte
Carlo Resort & Casino (collectively referred to as the “Casino Licensees”), operate
casinos and are required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Each gaming
license requires the periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable. MGM
Grand Las Vegas, New York-New York, The Primadonna Company, LLC and MGM MIRAGE
Manufacturing Corp. are also licensed as manufacturers and distributors of gaming
devices and Boardwalk is licensed as a distributor of gaming devices. MGM Grand Las
Vegas is also licensed to operate an International Gaming Salon. The Company and
certain of its subsidiaries are also licensed as shareholders, members and/or managers
of certain corporate and limited liability company Casino Licensees. The Company’s
subsidiary MRGS Corp. is licensed as a 50% general partner of Victoria Partners, the
joint venture with Mandalay Resort Group that owns and operates Monte Carlo.

The Company and Mirage are also each required to be registered by the Nevada
Commission as a publicly traded corporation (“Registered Corporation”) and as such, each
is required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the
Nevada Commission and furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may
require. No person may become a stockholder or member of, or receive any percentage of
profits from, the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp.,
without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The
Company, Mirage and the foregoing subsidiaries have obtained from the Nevada Gaming
Authorities the various registrations, approvals, permits and licenses required in order
to engage in gaming activities in Nevada.

The Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material
relationship to, or material involvement with, the Company, Mirage, the Casino
Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp. or MRGS Corp., to determine whether such
individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming
licensee. Officers, directors and certain key employees of the foregoing subsidiaries
must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and may be required to be
licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Certain officers, directors and key
employees of the Company and Mirage who are actively and directly involved in the gaming
activities of the foregoing subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found
suitable by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may deny an
application for licensing or a finding of suitability for any cause they deem
reasonable.



A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing, and both require submission of
detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The
applicant for licensing or a finding of suitability, or the gaming licensee by which the
applicant is employed or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costs of the
investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming
Authorities, and in addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of
suitability or licensure, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove
a change in a corporate position.

If the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee
unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with the Company, Mirage,
the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., such company or
companies would have to sever all relationships with such person. In addition, the
Nevada Commission may require the Company, Mirage or the foregoing subsidiaries to
terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.
Determinations of suitability or of questions pertaining to licensing are not subject to
judicial review in Nevada.

The Company, Mirage, the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., and MRGS
Corp. are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada
Commission. Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar
financing transactions by the Company, Mirage and the foregoing subsidiaries must be
reported to or approved by the Nevada Commission.

If it were determined that the Nevada Act was violated by the Casino Licensees, MGM
MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., the gaming licenses they hold could be
limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked, subject to compliance with certain statutory
and regulatory procedures. In addition, the Company, Mirage, the foregoing subsidiaries
and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate
violation of the Nevada Act at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Further, a
supervisor could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate the Company’s gaming
properties and, under certain circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor’s
appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the Company’s gaming properties)
could be forfeited to the State of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of
any gaming license or the appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of any
gaming license would) materially adversely affect the Company’s gaming operations.

Any beneficial holder of the Company’s voting securities, regardless of the number
of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his
or her suitability as a beneficial holder of the Company’s voting securities determined
if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be
inconsistent with the declared policies of the State of Nevada. The applicant must pay
all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any
such investigation.

The Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of the
Company’s voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission. The
Nevada Act requires that beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of the
Company’s voting securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitability
within thirty days after the Chairman of the Nevada Board mails the written notice
requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor” as
defined in the Nevada Act, which acquires more than 10% but not more than 15% of any
class of the Company’s voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Commission for a
waiver of such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting
securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor shall not be deemed
to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were
acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor
and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority
of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company, any change in the corporate
charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the Company or any of its gaming
affiliates, or any other action that the Nevada Commission finds to be inconsistent with
holding the Company’s voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities that
are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes
only include: (i) voting on all matters voted on by stockholders; (ii) making financial
and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for
informational purposes and not to cause a change in its management, policies or
operations; and (iii) such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be
consistent with such investment intent. If the beneficial holder of voting securities
who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit
detailed business and financial information including a list of beneficial owners. The
applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation.



Under the Nevada Act and under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor,”
as defined in the Nevada Act, which intends to acquire not more than 15% of any class of
nonvoting securities of a privately held corporation, limited partnership or limited
liability company that is also a registered holding or intermediary company or the
holder of a gaming license, may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of the usual
prior licensing or finding of suitability requirement if such institutional investor
holds such nonvoting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor
shall not be deemed to hold nonvoting securities for investment purposes unless the
nonvoting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an
institutional investor, do not give the institutional investor management authority, and
do not, directly or indirectly, allow the institutional investor to vote for the
election or appointment of members of the board of directors, a general partner or
manager, cause any change in the articles of organization, operating agreement, other
organic document, management, policies or operations, or cause any other action that the
Nevada Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding nonvoting securities for
investment purposes only. Activities not deemed to be inconsistent with holding
nonvoting securities for investment purposes only include: (i) nominating any candidate
for election or appointment to the entity’s board of directors or equivalent in
connection with a debt restructuring; (ii) making financial and other inquiries of
management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes
and not to cause a change in the entity’s management, policies or operations; and (iii)
such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such
investment intent. If the beneficial holder of nonvoting securities who must be found
suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and
financial information including a list of beneficial owners. The applicant is required
to pay all costs of investigation.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license
within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or the Chairman of
the Nevada Board may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner
if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any
stockholder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial
ownership of the common stock of a Registered Corporation beyond such period of time as
may be prescribed by the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a criminal offense. The
Company is subject to disciplinary action if, after it receives notice that a person is
unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with the Company,
Mirage, the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., the
Company, Mirage or the foregoing subsidiaries (i) pays that person any dividend or
interest upon voting securities of the Company, (ii) allows that person to exercise,
directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that
person, (iii) pays remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or
otherwise, or (iv) fails to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person
to relinquish his or her voting securities for cash at fair market value. Additionally,
the CCLGLB has taken the position that it has the authority to approve all persons
owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming licensee.

The Nevada Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder of any debt
security of a Registered Corporation to file an application, be investigated and be
found suitable to own the debt security of a Registered Corporation. If the Nevada
Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such security, then pursuant to
the Nevada Act, the Registered Corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its
approvals, if without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it: (i) pays to the
unsuitable person any dividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever; (ii)
recognizes any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such
securities; (iii) pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or (iv) makes any
payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange,
liquidation or similar transaction.

The Company is required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada that may be
examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held in
trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the
identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make
such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. The Company is
also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial
owner. The Nevada Commission has the power to require the Company’s and Mirage’s stock
certificates to bear a legend indicating that such securities are subject to the Nevada
Act. However, to date, the Nevada Commission has not imposed such a requirement on
either the Company or Mirage.

Neither the Company nor Mirage may make a public offering of any securities without
the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securities or the proceeds therefrom
are intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or
to retire or extend obligations incurred for such purposes. Such approval, if given,
does not constitute a finding, recommendation or approval by the Nevada Commission or
the Nevada Board as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investment
merits of the securities. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.



Under the Nevada Act, none of the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp.,
or MRGS Corp., may guarantee a security issued by the Company or Mirage pursuant to a
public offering, or pledge their assets to secure the payment or performance of the
obligations evidenced by such a security issued by the Company or Mirage, without the
prior approval of the Nevada Commission. Similarly, neither the common stock nor other
ownership interests of the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS
Corp., may be pledged, nor may the pledge of such common stock or other ownership
interests foreclose on such a pledge, without the prior approval of the Nevada
Commission. Restrictions on the transfer of any equity security issued by the Casino
Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., and agreements not to encumber
such securities, are ineffective without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission.

On January 22, 2004, the Nevada Commission granted the Company and Mirage prior
approval to make public offerings for a period of 18 months, subject to certain
conditions (the “Shelf Approval”). The Shelf Approval also includes approval for the
Company and Mirage to place restrictions on the transfer of any equity security issued
to the Casino Licensees, MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., and to enter
into agreements not to encumber such securities, pursuant to any public offering made
under the Shelf Approval. However, the Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause
without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of
the Nevada Board. The Shelf Approval does not constitute a finding, recommendation or
approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada Board as to the accuracy or adequacy of
the prospectus or the investment merits of the securities offered. Any representation
to the contrary is unlawful.

Changes in control of the Company or Mirage through merger, consolidation, stock or
asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or any act or conduct by a
person whereby he or she obtains control, may not occur without the prior approval of
the Nevada Commission. Entities seeking to acquire control of a Registered Corporation
must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada Commission concerning a variety of
stringent standards prior to assuming control of such Registered Corporation. The
Nevada Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and
other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to
acquire control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process of the
transaction.

The Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by
management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defensive tactics affecting
Nevada gaming licensees, and Registered Corporations that are affiliated with those
operations, may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada
Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse
effects of these business practices upon Nevada’s gaming industry and to further
Nevada’s policy to: (i) assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and
their affiliates; (ii) preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the
corporate form; and (iii) promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of
corporate affairs. Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada
Commission before the Company can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities
above the current market price thereof and before a corporate acquisition opposed by
management can be consummated.

The Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed
by a Registered Corporation’s board of directors in response to a tender offer made
directly to the Registered Corporation’s stockholders for the purpose of acquiring
control of the Registered Corporation.

License fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or
activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada and to Clark County. Depending
upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either
monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon either: (i) a percentage of the gross
revenues received; (ii) the number of gaming devices operated; or (iii) the number of
table games operated. The tax on gross revenues received is generally 6.75%. An excise
tax is also paid by the Casino Licensees on charges for admission to any facility where
certain forms of live entertainment are provided. Nevada licensees that hold a license
as a manufacturer or a distributor, such as MGM Grand Las Vegas, New York-New York, The
Primadonna Company, LLC, the Boardwalk and MGM MIRAGE Manufacturing Corp., also pay
certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada.

Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be
registered, or is under common control with such persons (collectively, “Licensees”),
and who proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required
to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the
amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Board of their
participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or
decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Thereafter, Licensees are also
required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act.



Licensees are also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Commission if they
knowingly violate any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming
operation, fail to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards
of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations, engage in any activity or
enter into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to
the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect discredit or disrepute
upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of
Nevada, engage in any activity or enter into any association that interferes with the
ability of the State of Nevada to collect gaming taxes and fees, or employ, contract
with or associate with any person in the foreign gaming operation who has been denied a
license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of personal unsuitability,
or who has been found guilty of cheating at gambling.

The sale of alcoholic beverages by the Casino Licensees is subject to licensing,
control and regulation by the applicable local authorities. All licenses are revocable
and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition,
suspend or revoke any such license, and any such disciplinary action could (and
revocation would) have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s operations.

Pursuant to a 1985 agreement with the United States Department of the Treasury (the
“Treasury”) and provisions of the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994, the Nevada
Commission and the Nevada Board have authority, under Regulation 6A of the Nevada Act,
to enforce their own cash transaction reporting laws applicable to casinos which
substantially parallel the federal Bank Secrecy Act. The Nevada Act requires gaming
licensees to monitor receipts and disbursements of currency related to cash purchases of
chips, cash wagers, cash deposits or cash payment of gaming debts in excess of $10,000
in a 24-hour period, and file reports of such transactions with the United States
Internal Revenue Service. Casinos are required to file suspicious activity reports with
the Treasury and provide copies thereof to the Nevada Board. Nevada casinos are
required to meet the reporting and record keeping requirements of Treasury regulations
recently amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.

Michigan Government Regulation and Taxation

The
Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act (the “Michigan Act”) subjects the ownership and operation of
casino gaming facilities to extensive state licensing and regulatory requirements. The
Michigan Act also authorizes local regulation of casino gaming facilities by the City of
Detroit, provided that any such local ordinances regulating casino gaming are consistent
with the Michigan Act and rules promulgated to implement it.

The
Michigan Act creates the Michigan Gaming Control Board (the “ Michigan Bord”) and authorizes it to
grant casino licenses to not more than three applicants who have entered into
development agreements with the City of Detroit. The Michigan Board is granted
extensive authority to conduct background investigations and determine the suitability
of casino license applicants, affiliated companies, officers, directors, or managerial
employees of applicants and affiliated companies and persons or entities holding a one
percent or greater direct or indirect interest in an applicant or affiliated company.
Institutional investors holding less than certain specified amounts of debt or equity
securities are exempted from meeting the suitability requirements of the Michigan Act,
provided such securities are issued by a publicly traded corporation, such as MGM
MIRAGE, and the securities were purchased for investment purposes only and not for the
purpose of influencing or affecting the affairs of the issuer. Any person who supplies
goods or services to a casino licensee which are directly related to, used in connection
with, or affecting gaming, and any person who supplies other goods or services to a
casino licensee on a regular and continuing basis, must obtain a supplier’s license from
the Michigan Board. In addition, any individual employed by a casino licensee or by a
supplier licensee whose work duties are related to or involved in the gambling operation
or are performed in a restricted area or a gaming area of a casino must obtain an
occupational license from the Michigan Board.

The Michigan Act imposes the burden of proof on the applicant for a casino license
to establish its suitability to receive and hold the license. The applicant must
establish its suitability as to integrity, moral character and reputation, business
probity, financial ability and experience, responsibility, and other criteria deemed
appropriate by the Michigan Board. A casino license is valid for a period of one year
and the Michigan Board may refuse to renew it upon a determination that the licensee no
longer meets the requirements for licensure.

The Michigan Board may, among other things, revoke, suspend or restrict a casino
license. Substantial fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming or liquor
control laws or rules may also be levied against a casino licensee. In the event that a
casino license is revoked or suspended for more than 120 days, the Michigan Act provides
for the appointment of a conservator who, among other things, is
required to preserve the assets to ensure that they shall continue to
be operated in a sound and businesslike manner, or upon order of the
Michigan Board, to sell or
otherwise transfer the assets of the casino licensee or former licensee to another
person or entity who meets the requirements of the Michigan Act for licensure, subject
to certain approvals and consultations.



The Michigan Board has
adopted administrative rules to implement the terms of the Michigan Act. Among other things, the rules
impose more detailed substantive and procedural requirements with respect to casino
licensing and operations. Included are requirements regarding such things as licensing
investigations and hearings, record keeping and retention, contracting, reports to the
Michigan Board, internal control and accounting procedures, security and surveillance,
extensions of credit to gaming patrons, conduct of gaming, and transfers of ownership
interests in licensed casinos. The rules also establish numerous Michigan Board
procedures regarding licensing, disciplinary and other hearings, and similar matters.
The rules have the force of law and are binding on the Michigan Board as well as on
applicants for or holders of casino licenses.

The Michigan Liquor Control Commission licenses, controls and regulates the sale of
alcoholic beverages by the MGM Grand Detroit casino pursuant to the Michigan Liquor
Control Code of 1998. The Michigan Act also requires that casinos sell and distribute alcoholic
beverages in a manner consistent with the Michigan Liquor Control Code.

The Detroit City Council enacted an ordinance entitled “Casino Gaming Authorization
and Casino Development Agreement Certification and Compliance.” The ordinance
authorizes casino gaming only by operators who are licensed by the Michigan Board and
are parties to a development agreement which has been approved and certified by the City
Council and is currently in effect, or are acting on behalf of such parties. The
development agreement among the City of Detroit, MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and the Economic
Development Corporation of the City of Detroit has been so approved and certified and is currently
in effect. The ordinance requires each casino operator to submit to the Mayor of
Detroit and to the City Council periodic reports regarding the operator’s compliance
with its development agreement or, in the event of non-compliance, reasons for
non-compliance and an explanation of efforts to comply. The ordinance requires the
Mayor of Detroit to monitor each casino operator’s compliance with its development
agreement, to take appropriate enforcement action in the event of default and to notify
the City Council of defaults and enforcement action taken; and, if a development
agreement is terminated, it requires the City Council to transmit notice of such action
to the Michigan Board within five business days along with Detroit’s request that the
Michigan Board revoke the relevant operator’s certificate of suitability or casino
license. If a development agreement is terminated, the Michigan Act requires the
Michigan Board to revoke the relevant operator’s casino license upon the request of
Detroit.

The administrative rules of the Michigan Board prohibit a casino licensee or a
holding company or affiliate that has control of a casino licensee in Michigan from
entering into a debt transaction affecting the capitalization or financial viability of
its Michigan casino operation without prior approval from the Michigan Board. On
October 14, 2003, the Michigan Board authorized MGM Grand Detroit, LLC to borrow under
the Company’s credit facilities for the purpose of financing the development of its
permanent casino and the future expansion thereof, maintenance capital expenditures for
its temporary and permanent casinos and the cost of renovating the temporary casino
facility for adaptive re-use and/or sale following the completion of the permanent
casino, and to secure such borrowings with liens upon substantially all of its assets.
In the same order, the Michigan Board authorized MGM Grand Detroit, Inc. to pledge its
equity interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC to secure such borrowings.

The Michigan Act effectively provides that each of the three casinos in Detroit
shall pay a wagering tax equal to 24% of its adjusted gross receipts (up from 18% prior
to September 1, 2004 and subject to adjustment as described below), which tax is shared
between Michigan and Detroit, an annual municipal service fee equal to the greater of $4
million or 1.25% of its adjusted gross receipts, to be paid to Detroit to defray its
cost of hosting casinos, and an annual assessment in the initial amount of approximately
$8.3 million and adjusted annually based upon a consumer price index, to be paid by each
casino to Michigan to defray its regulatory enforcement and other casino-related costs.
These payments are in addition to the taxes, fees and assessments customarily paid by
business entities operating in Detroit. The development agreement between it and Detroit
also obligates MGM Grand Detroit, LLC to pay $34 million to Detroit and $10 million to
Detroit’s Minority Business Development Fund, both of which payments have been made, and
beginning on January 1, 2006 to pay 1% of its adjusted gross receipts to Detroit, to be
increased to 2% of its adjusted gross receipts in any calendar year in which adjusted
gross receipts exceed $400 million. Once our subsidiary has operated a permanent casino
complex for 30 consecutive days and is determined to be in compliance with its
development agreement with Detroit, the wagering tax rate effective under the Michigan
Act will be reduced to 19%. Conversely, if it does not commence such operations by July
1, 2009, the rate will increase annually on a graduated basis to a maximum of 27% until
such operations have commenced.

The Michigan Act provides that an entity holding more than a 10% ownership interest
in one Michigan casino licensee is ineligible for licensure if it holds more than a 10%
ownership interest in a second Michigan casino licensee. Therefore, upon consummation
of its merger with Mandalay Resort Group, MGM MIRAGE will be required to dispose of
its indirect ownership interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC or Detroit Entertainment,
L.L.C. (Motor City Casino) in accordance with the Michigan Act and Michigan Rules.



Mississippi Government Regulation

We conduct our Mississippi gaming operations through an indirect subsidiary, Beau
Rivage Resorts, Inc., which owns and operates Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi. The
ownership and operation of casino facilities in Mississippi are subject to extensive
state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing and regulatory control of the
Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi State Tax Commission.

The
Mississippi Gaming Control Act, (the “Mississippi Act”) which legalized dockside casino gaming in
Mississippi, was enacted on June 29, 1990. Although not identical, the Mississippi Act
is similar to the Nevada Gaming Control Act. Effective October 29, 1991, the
Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted regulations in furtherance of the Mississippi Act
which are also similar in many respects to the Nevada gaming regulations. The laws,
regulations and supervisory procedures of Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming
Commission seek to:

The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi
Gaming Commission. Changes in Mississippi law or the regulations or the Mississippi
Gaming Commission’s interpretations thereof may limit or otherwise materially affect the
types of gaming that may be conducted, and could have a material adverse effect on us
and our Mississippi gaming operations.

The Mississippi Act provides for legalized dockside gaming at the discretion of the
14 counties that either border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River, but only if the
voters in such counties have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county. As of January
1, 2005, dockside gaming was permissible in nine of the 14 eligible counties in the
state and gaming operations had commenced in Adams, Coahoma, Hancock, Harrison, Tunica,
Warren and Washington counties. Under Mississippi law, gaming vessels must be located
on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the
Mississippi River, or in the waters of the State of Mississippi lying south of the state
in eligible counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The law permits unlimited stakes
gaming on permanently moored vessels on a 24-hour basis and does not restrict the
percentage of space which may be utilized for gaming. There are no limitations on the
number of gaming licenses which may be issued in Mississippi.

Beau Rivage Resorts and Beau Rivage Distribution Corp. (“BRDC”), a subsidiary of
Beau Rivage Resorts, are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the
Mississippi Gaming Commission. Beau Rivage Resorts is licensed as a Mississippi gaming
operator, and BRDC is licensed as a Mississippi distributor of gaming devices. Gaming
licenses require the periodic payment of fees and taxes and are not transferable.
Gaming licenses are issued for a maximum term of three years and must be renewed
periodically thereafter. Beau Rivage Resorts received its Mississippi gaming license on
June 20, 1996 and a renewal on June 21, 1998. BRDC received its Mississippi
distributor’s license on August 20, 1998. On May 18, 2000, the Mississippi Gaming
Commission renewed the licenses of both Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC for terms of three
years each, effective June 22, 2000. On May 21, 2003, the Mississippi Gaming Commission
renewed the licenses of Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC effective June 23, 2003 through
June 22, 2006.

On May 18, 2000, the Mississippi Gaming Commission registered MGM MIRAGE under the
Mississippi Act as a publicly traded holding company of Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC.
As a registered publicly traded corporation, MGM MIRAGE is subject to the licensing and
regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and is required to periodically
submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming
Commission and furnish any other information which the Mississippi Gaming Commission may
require. If MGM MIRAGE is unable to satisfy the registration requirements of the
Mississippi Act, MGM MIRAGE and its licensed subsidiaries cannot own or operate gaming
facilities in Mississippi. Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC are also required to
periodically submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi
Gaming Commission and the Mississippi State Tax Commission and to furnish any other
information required thereby. No person may become a stockholder of or receive any
percentage of profits from a licensed subsidiary of a holding company without first
obtaining licenses and approvals from the Mississippi Gaming Commission.



Certain of our officers, directors and employees must be found suitable or be
licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We believe that we have applied for all
necessary findings of suitability with respect to these persons, although the
Mississippi Gaming Commission, in its discretion, may require additional persons to file
applications for findings of suitability. In addition, any person having a material
relationship or involvement with us may be required to be found suitable, in which case
those persons must pay the costs and fees associated with the investigation. A finding
of suitability requires submission of detailed personal and financial information
followed by a thorough investigation. There can be no assurance that a person who is
subject to a finding of suitability will be found suitable by the Mississippi Gaming
Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may deny an application for a finding of
suitability for any cause that it deems reasonable. Findings of suitability must be
periodically renewed.

Changes in certain licensed positions must be reported to the Mississippi Gaming
Commission. In addition to its authority to deny an application for a finding of
suitability, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change
in a licensed position. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to require us
to suspend or dismiss officers, directors and other key employees or sever relationships
with other persons who refuse to file appropriate applications or whom the authorities
find unsuitable to act in their capacities.

Employees associated with gaming must obtain work permits that are subject to
immediate suspension. The Mississippi Gaming Commission will refuse to issue a work
permit to a person convicted of a felony and it may refuse to issue a work permit to a
gaming employee if the employee has committed various misdemeanors or knowingly violated
the Mississippi Act or for any other reasonable cause.

At any time, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to investigate and
require a finding of suitability of any record or beneficial stockholders of a publicly
traded corporation registered with the Mississippi Gaming Commission, regardless of the
percentage of ownership. Mississippi law requires any person who acquires more than 5%
of the voting securities of a publicly traded corporation registered with the
Mississippi Gaming Commission to report the acquisition to the Mississippi Gaming
Commission, and that person may be required to be found suitable. Also, any person who
becomes a beneficial owner of more than 10% of the voting securities of such a company,
as reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, must apply for a finding of
suitability by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. An applicant for finding of
suitability must pay the costs and fees that the Mississippi Gaming Commission incurs in
conducting the investigation. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has generally exercised
its discretion to require a finding of suitability of any beneficial owner of more than
5% of a registered public or private company’s voting securities. However, the
Mississippi Gaming Commission has adopted a regulation that permits certain
institutional investors to own beneficially up to 15% and, under certain circumstances,
up to 19%, of a registered or licensed company’s voting securities without a finding of
suitability.

Under the regulations, an “institutional investor,” as defined therein, may apply
to the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission for a waiver of a finding
of suitability if such institutional investor (i) beneficially owns up to 15% (or, in
certain circumstances, up to 19%) of the voting securities of a registered or licensed
company, and (ii) holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An
institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment
purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course
of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or
indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the
registered or licensed company, any change in the registered or licensed company’s
corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the registered public
or private company or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the
Mississippi Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding the registered or
licensed company’s voting securities for investment purposes only.

Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities
for investment purposes only include:

•

voting, directly or indirectly through the delivery of a proxy furnished by the
board of directors, on all matters voted upon by the holders of such voting
securities;

•

serving as a member of any committee of creditors or security holders formed in
connection with a debt restructuring;

•

nominating any candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors
in connection with a debt restructuring;



•

accepting appointment or election (or having a representative accept appointment
or election) as a member of the board of directors in connection with a debt
restructuring and serving in that capacity until the conclusion of the member’s
term;

•

making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by
securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in
management, policies or operations; and

•

such other activities as the Mississippi Gaming Commission may determine to be
consistent with such investment intent.

If a stockholder who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust,
it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list of
beneficial owners. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may at any time dissolve,
suspend, condition, limit or restrict a finding of suitability to own a registered
public company’s equity interests for any cause it deems reasonable.

We may be required to disclose to the Mississippi Gaming Commission upon request
the identities of the holders of any debt or other securities. In addition, under the
Mississippi Act, the Mississippi Gaming Commission may, in its discretion, require
holders of debt securities of registered corporations to file applications, investigate
the holders, and require the holders to be found suitable to own the debt securities.

Although the Mississippi Gaming Commission generally does not require the
individual holders of obligations such as notes to be investigated and found suitable,
the Mississippi Gaming Commission retains the discretion to do so for any reason,
including but not limited to a default, or where the holder of the debt instrument
exercises a material influence over the gaming operations of the entity in question.
Any holder of debt securities required to apply for a finding of suitability must pay
all investigative fees and costs of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection with
the investigation.

Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license
within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Mississippi Gaming Commission may be
found unsuitable. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly,
any beneficial ownership of our securities beyond the time that the Mississippi Gaming
Commission prescribes, may be guilty of a misdemeanor. We will be subject to
disciplinary action if, after receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a
stockholder, a holder of our debt securities or to have any other relationship with us,
we:

Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC must maintain in Mississippi a current ledger with
respect to the ownership of their equity securities and MGM MIRAGE must maintain in
Mississippi a current list of its stockholders which must reflect the record ownership
of each outstanding share of any equity security issued by MGM MIRAGE. The ledger and
stockholder lists must be available for inspection by the Mississippi Gaming Commission
at any time. If any of our securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee,
the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to
the Mississippi Gaming Commission. A failure to make that disclosure may be grounds for
finding the record holder unsuitable. The Company must also render maximum assistance in
determining the identity of the beneficial owner.

The Mississippi Act requires that the certificates representing securities of a
registered publicly traded corporation bear a legend to the general effect that the
securities are subject to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission. On May 18, 2000, the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted us a
waiver of this legend requirement. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to
impose additional restrictions on us and the holders of our securities at any time.



Substantially all loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing
transactions by a licensed gaming subsidiary must be reported to or approved by the
Mississippi Gaming Commission. A licensed gaming subsidiary may not make a public
offering of its securities, but may pledge or mortgage casino facilities if it obtains
the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We may not make a public
offering of our securities without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission if any part of the proceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the
construction, acquisition or operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or to retire
or extend obligations incurred for those purposes. The approval, if given, does not
constitute a recommendation or approval of the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or
the investment merits of the securities subject to the offering. On September 24, 2003,
the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted us a waiver of the prior approval requirement
for our securities offerings for a period of two years, subject to certain conditions.
The waiver may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an
interlocutory stop order by the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

Under the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, Beau Rivage Resorts and
BRDC may not guarantee a security issued by MGM MIRAGE pursuant to a public offering, or
pledge their assets to secure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by
such a security issued by MGM MIRAGE, without the prior approval of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission. Similarly, MGM MIRAGE may not pledge the stock or other ownership
interests of Beau Rivage Resorts or BRDC, nor may the pledgee of such ownership
interests foreclose on such a pledge, without the prior approval of the Mississippi
Gaming Commission. Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued
by Beau Rivage Resorts or BRDC and agreements not to encumber such securities granted by
MGM MIRAGE are ineffective without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission. The waiver of the prior approval requirement for MGM MIRAGE’s securities
offerings received from the Mississippi Gaming Commission on September 24, 2003 includes
a waiver of the prior approval requirement for such guarantees, pledges and restrictions
of Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC, subject to certain conditions.

MGM MIRAGE cannot change its control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of
assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover without the prior
approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may
also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and other persons having a
material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be
investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.

The Mississippi Legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed
by management, repurchases of voting securities and other corporate defensive tactics
that affect corporate gaming licensees in Mississippi and corporations whose stock is
publicly traded that are affiliated with those licensees may be injurious to stable and
productive corporate gaming. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has established a
regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business
practices upon Mississippi’s gaming industry and to further Mississippi’s policy to
assure the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates,
preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form, and
promote a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

MGM MIRAGE may be required to obtain approval from the Mississippi Gaming
Commission before it may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities in excess of
the current market price of its common stock (commonly called “greenmail”) or before it
may consummate a corporate acquisition opposed by management. The regulations also
require prior approval by the Mississippi Gaming Commission if MGM MIRAGE adopts a plan
of recapitalization proposed by its Board of Directors opposing a tender offer made
directly to the stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of MGM MIRAGE.

Neither MGM MIRAGE nor Beau Rivage Resorts may engage in gaming activities in
Mississippi while MGM MIRAGE, Beau Rivage Resorts and/or persons found suitable to be
associated with the gaming license of Beau Rivage Resorts conduct gaming operations
outside of Mississippi without approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The
Mississippi Gaming Commission may require that it have access to information concerning
MGM MIRAGE’s and its affiliates’ out-of-state gaming operations. Gaming operations in
Nevada were approved when Beau Rivage Resorts was first licensed in Mississippi. MGM
MIRAGE has received waivers of foreign gaming approval from the Mississippi Gaming
Commission for the conduct of active or planned gaming operations in Michigan, New
Jersey, California, New York, Illinois, the United Kingdom and Macau, and for cruises with
Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines or Carnival Cruise Lines which originate from the United
States, and may be required to obtain the approval or a waiver of such approval from the
Mississippi Gaming Commission before engaging in any additional future gaming operations
outside of Mississippi. We have an application pending for the jurisdiction in Macau.



If the Mississippi Gaming Commission decides that a licensed gaming subsidiary
violated a gaming law or regulation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could limit,
condition, suspend or revoke the license of the subsidiary. In addition, we, the
licensed subsidiary and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for
each separate violation. A violation under any of MGM MIRAGE’s other operating
subsidiaries’ gaming licenses may be deemed a violation of Beau Rivage Resorts’ gaming
license. Because of a violation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could attempt to
appoint a supervisor to operate the casino facilities. Limitation, conditioning or
suspension of Beau Rivage Resorts’ gaming license or MGM MIRAGE’s registration as a
publicly traded holding company of Beau Rivage Resorts, or the appointment of a
supervisor could, and the revocation of any gaming license or registration would,
materially adversely affect our Mississippi gaming operations.

A licensed gaming subsidiary must pay license fees and taxes, computed in various
ways depending on the type of gaming involved, to the State of Mississippi and to the
county or city in which the licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations. Depending
upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either
monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon a percentage of gross gaming revenues,
the number of slot machines operated by the casino, and the number of table games
operated by the casino.

The license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based upon “gaming
receipts,” generally defined as gross receipts less payouts to customers as winnings,
and generally equals 8% of gaming receipts. These license fees are allowed as a credit
against our Mississippi income tax liability for the year paid. The gross revenue fee
imposed by the Mississippi cities and counties in which casino operations are located is
in addition to the fees payable to the State of Mississippi and equals approximately 4%
of the gaming receipts.

The Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted a regulation in 1994 requiring as a
condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment’s plan include a
500-car parking facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure
facilities which will amount to at least 25% of the casino cost. Infrastructure
facilities are defined in the regulation to include a hotel with at least 250 rooms,
theme park, golf course and other similar facilities. With the opening of its resort
hotel and other amenities, Beau Rivage Resorts is in compliance with this requirement.
On January 21, 1999, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted an amendment to this
regulation which increased the infrastructure requirement to 100% from the existing 25%;
however, the regulation grandfathers existing licensees and applies only to new casino
projects and casinos that are not operating at the time of acquisition or purchase, and
would therefore not apply to Beau Rivage Resorts. In any event, Beau Rivage would
comply with such requirement.

Both the local jurisdiction and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the
Mississippi State Tax Commission license, control and regulate the sale of alcoholic
beverages by Beau Rivage Resorts. Beau Rivage is in an area designated as a special
resort area, which allows casinos located therein to serve alcoholic beverages on a
24-hour basis. The Alcoholic Beverage Control Division requires that the key officers
and managers of MGM MIRAGE and Beau Rivage Resorts and all owners of more than 5% of
Beau Rivage Resorts’ equity submit detailed personal, and in some instances, financial
information to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division and be investigated and licensed.
All such licenses are non-transferable. The Alcohol Beverage Control Division has the
full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license for the service of
alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee on probation with or without conditions. Any
disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon the
casino’s operations.

New Jersey Government Regulation

The ownership and operation of hotel-casino facilities and gaming activities in
Atlantic City, New Jersey are subject to extensive state regulation under the New Jersey
Casino Control Act and the regulations of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and
other applicable laws. The New Jersey Act also established the New Jersey Division of
Gaming Enforcement to investigate all license applications, enforce the provisions of
the New Jersey Act and regulations and prosecute all proceedings for violations of the
New Jersey Act and regulations before the New Jersey Commission. In order to own or
operate a hotel-casino property in New Jersey, a company must obtain a license or other
approvals from the New Jersey Commission and obtain numerous other licenses, permits and
approvals from other state as well as local governmental authorities.



The New Jersey Commission has broad discretion regarding the issuance, renewal,
revocation and suspension of casino licenses. The New Jersey Act and regulations
concern primarily the good character, honesty, integrity and financial stability of
casino licensees, their intermediary and holding companies, their employees, their
security holders and others financially interested in casino operations; financial and
accounting practices used in connection with casino operations; rules of games, levels
of supervision of games and methods of selling and redeeming chips; manner of granting
credit, duration of credit and enforceability of gaming debts; and distribution of
alcoholic beverages.

On June 11, 2003, the New Jersey Commission issued a casino license to Borgata
Hotel Casino & Spa and found MGM MIRAGE and certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries,
and their then officers, directors, and 5% or greater shareholders suitable. In June
2004, the casino license of Borgata was renewed for a term ending June 30, 2005.

The New Jersey Act further provides that each person who directly or indirectly
holds any beneficial interest in or ownership of the securities issued by a casino
licensee or any of its intermediary or holding companies, those persons who, in the
opinion of the New Jersey Commission, have the ability to control the casino licensee or
its intermediary or holding companies or elect a majority of the board of directors of
such companies, other than a banking or other licensed lending institution which makes a
loan or holds a mortgage or other lien acquired in the ordinary course of business,
lenders and underwriters of such companies are required to be qualified by the New
Jersey Commission. However, with respect to a holding company such as MGM MIRAGE, a
waiver of qualification may be granted by the New Jersey Commission, with the
concurrence of the Director of the New Jersey Division, if the New Jersey Commission
determines that such persons or entities are not significantly involved in the
activities of a casino licensee and in the case of security holders, do not have the
ability to control MGM MIRAGE or elect one or more of its directors. There exists a
rebuttable presumption that any person holding 5% or more of the equity securities of a
casino licensee’s intermediary or holding company or a person having the ability to
elect one or more of the directors of such a company has the ability to control the
company and thus must obtain qualification from the New Jersey Commission.

Notwithstanding this presumption of control, the New Jersey Act provides for a
waiver of qualification for passive “institutional investors,” as defined by the New
Jersey Act, if the institutional investor purchased publicly traded securities for
investment purposes only and where such securities constitute less than 10% of the
equity securities of a casino licensee’s holding or intermediary company or debt
securities of a casino licensee’s holding or intermediary company representing a
percentage of the outstanding debt of such company not exceeding 20% or a percentage of
any issue of the outstanding debt of such company not exceeding 50%. The waiver of
qualification is subject to certain conditions including, upon request of the New Jersey
Commission, filing a certified statement that the institutional investor has no
intention of influencing or affecting the affairs of the issuer, except that an
institutional investor holding voting securities shall be permitted to vote on matters
put to a vote of the holders of outstanding voting securities. Additionally, a waiver
of qualification may also be granted to institutional investors holding a higher
percentage of securities of a casino licensee’s holding or intermediary company upon a
showing of good cause.

The New Jersey Act requires the certificate of incorporation of a publicly traded
holding company to provide that any securities of such a corporation are held subject to
the condition that if a holder is found to be disqualified by the New Jersey Commission
pursuant to the New Jersey Act, such holder shall dispose of his interest in such
company. Accordingly, our certificate of incorporation provides that a holder of our
securities must dispose of such securities if the holder is found disqualified under the
New Jersey Act. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we may
redeem the stock of any holder found to be disqualified.

If the New Jersey Commission should find a security holder to be unqualified to be
a holder of securities of a casino licensee or holding company, not only must the
disqualified holder dispose of such securities but in addition, commencing on the date
the New Jersey Commission serves notice upon such a company of the determination of
disqualification, it shall be unlawful for the disqualified holder to:

•

receive any dividends or interest upon any such securities;

•

exercise, directly or through any trustee or nominee, any right conferred by such securities; or

•

receive any remuneration in any form from the licensee for services rendered or otherwise.



If the New Jersey Commission should find a security holder to be unqualified to be
a holder of securities of a casino licensee or holding company, the New Jersey
Commission shall take any necessary action to protect the public interest, including the
suspension or revocation of the casino license, except that if the disqualified person
is the holder of securities of a publicly traded holding company, the New Jersey
Commission shall not take action against the casino license if:

•

the holding company has the corporate charter provisions concerning divestiture
of securities by disqualified owners required by the New Jersey Act;

•

the holding company has made good faith efforts, including the pursuit of legal
remedies, to comply with any order of the New Jersey Commission; and

•

the disqualified holder does not have the ability to control the company or
elect one or more members of the company’s board of directors.

If the New Jersey Commission determines that a casino licensee has violated the New
Jersey Act or regulations, or if any security holder of MGM MIRAGE or a casino licensee
who is required to be qualified under the New Jersey Act is found to be disqualified but
does not dispose of the securities, a casino licensee could be subject to fines or its
license could be suspended or revoked. If a casino licensee’s license is revoked after
issuance, the New Jersey Commission could appoint a conservator to operate and to
dispose of the hotel-casino facilities operated by such casino licensee. Net proceeds
of a sale by a conservator and net profits of operations by a conservator, at least up
to an amount equal to a fair return on investment which is reasonable for casinos or
hotels, would be paid to us.

The New Jersey Act imposes an annual tax of 8% on gross casino revenues, as defined
in the New Jersey Act, a 4.25% tax on the value of rooms, food beverage or entertainment
provided at no cost or a reduced price, a $3 tax per day on each occupied hotel room, a
$3 parking tax per day and, through June 30, 2006, a 7.5% tax on “adjusted net income”,
as defined in the New Jersey Act, subject to certain minimums and limitations. In
addition, casino licensees are required to invest 1.25% of gross casino revenues for the
purchase of bonds to be issued by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority or make
other approved investments equal to that amount. In the event the investment
requirement is not met, the casino licensee is subject to a tax in the amount of 2.5% on
gross casino revenues. The New Jersey Commission has established fees for the issuance
or renewal of casino licenses and hotel-casino alcoholic beverage licenses and an annual
license fee on each slot machine.

In addition to compliance with the New Jersey Act and regulations relating to
gaming, any property built in Atlantic City by us must comply with the New Jersey and
Atlantic City laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the Coastal Area
Facilities Review Act, construction of buildings, environmental considerations and the
operation of hotels. Any changes to such laws or the laws regarding gaming could have
an adverse effect on the Company.

Illinois Government Regulation

MGM MIRAGE will become subject to the jurisdiction of the Illinois gaming
authorities after the completion of its acquisition of Mandalay’s 50% interest in Grand
Victoria Riverboat Casino based in Elgin, Illinois (the “Grand Victoria”).

In February 1990, the State of Illinois legalized riverboat gambling. The Illinois
Riverboat Gambling Act (the “Illinois Act”) authorizes the five-member Illinois Gaming
Board (the “Illinois Board”) to issue up to ten riverboat gaming owners’ licenses on
navigable streams within or forming a boundary of the State of Illinois except for Lake
Michigan and any waterway in Cook County, which includes Chicago. Pursuant to the
initial Illinois Act, a licensed owner who holds greater than a 10% interest in one
riverboat operation located in Illinois, could hold no more than a 10% interest in any
other riverboat operation located in Illinois. In addition, the initial Illinois Act
restricted the location of certain of the ten owners’ licenses. Four of the licenses
were to be located on the Mississippi River, one license was to be at a location on the
Illinois River south of Marshall County and one license had to be located on the Des
Plaines River in Will County. The remaining licenses were not restricted as to location.
Currently, nine owner’s licenses are in operation in Alton, Aurora, East Peoria, East
St. Louis, Elgin, Metropolis, Rock Island and two licenses in Joliet.



The tenth license, which was initially granted to an operator in East Dubuque, was
not renewed by the Illinois Board and has been the subject of on-going litigation. The
Illinois Board entered into a settlement agreement with the current operator pursuant to
which the Illinois Board used a competitive bid process to select a new operator to
acquire the entity that possesses the tenth license. The Illinois Board selected Isle of
Capri as the winning bidder. Isle of Capri’s bid provides that it would locate its
gaming operation in Rosemont, Illinois. The closing of this transaction is contingent
upon the settlement of outstanding litigation, the Illinois Board finding Isle of Capri
suitable for licensure and the Illinois Attorney General’s final approval of the
settlement agreement between the Illinois Board and the current operator of the tenth
license. The initial Illinois Act also provided that no gambling could be conducted
while a riverboat was docked and included several provisions regarding the duration of
each riverboat cruise and the manner in which the cruises were conducted.

In June 1999, amendments to the Illinois Act were passed by the legislature and
signed into law by the Governor. The amended Illinois Act redefined the conduct of
gaming in Illinois. Pursuant to the amended Illinois Act, riverboats may conduct
gambling without cruising and passengers can enter and leave a riverboat at any time. In
addition, riverboats currently may be located upon any water within Illinois and not
just navigable waterways. There is no longer any prohibition of a riverboat being
located in Cook County. Riverboats are now defined as self-propelled excursion boats or
permanently moored barges. The amended Illinois Act requires that only three, rather
than four owner’s licenses, be located on the Mississippi River. The 10% ownership
prohibition has also been removed. Therefore, subject to certain Illinois Board rules,
individuals or entities could own more than one riverboat operation in Illinois.

The amended Illinois Act also allows for the relocation of a riverboat home dock. A
licensee that was not conducting riverboat gambling on January 1, 1998, may apply to the
Illinois Board for renewal and approval of relocation to a new home dock and the
Illinois Board shall grant the application and approval of the new home dock upon the
licensee providing to the Illinois Board authorization from the new dockside community.
It was pursuant to this particular provision of the amended Illinois Act that the former
owner of the East Dubuque riverboat applied for relocation of its operation to Rosemont,
and it is this license that was the subject of the recent competitive bid process. Any
licensee that relocates in accordance with the provisions of the amended Illinois Act,
must attain a level of at least 20% minority and female ownership at its gaming
operation.

The constitutionality of the relocation provisions of the amended Illinois Act was
challenged. That lawsuit is currently pending before the Illinois Supreme Court. There
is no assurance that the relocation provisions will be deemed constitutional. In 2003,
the Illinois legislature passed and the Governor signed the 2003 amendments to the
Illinois Act. The 2003 amendments provided, among other things, that the provisions of
the Illinois Act are severable. Thus, regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit, it will
not affect other sections of the amended Illinois Act.

The Illinois Act strictly regulates the facilities, persons, associations and
practices related to gaming operations. It grants the Illinois Board specific powers and
duties, and all other powers necessary and proper to fully and effectively execute the
Illinois Act for the purpose of administering, regulating and enforcing the system of
riverboat gaming. The Illinois Board has authority over every person, association,
corporation, partnership and trust involved in riverboat gaming operations in the State
of Illinois.

The Illinois Act requires the owner of a riverboat gaming operation to hold an
owner’s license issued by the Illinois Board. Each owner’s license permits the holder to
own up to two riverboats as part of its gaming operation, however, gaming participants
are limited to 1,200 for any owner’s license. The number of gaming participants will be
determined by the number of gaming positions available at any given time. Gaming
positions are counted as follows:

•

positions for electronic gaming devices will be determined as 90% of the total
number of devices available for play;

•

craps tables will be counted as having ten gaming positions; and

•

games utilizing live gaming devices, except for craps, will be counted as having five gaming positions.

Each owner’s license initially runs for a period of three years. Thereafter, the
license must be renewed annually. Under the amended Illinois Act, the Board may renew an
owner’s license for up to four years. An owner licensee is eligible for renewal upon
payment of the applicable fee and a determination by the Illinois Board that the
licensee continues to meet all of the requirements of the Illinois Act and Illinois
Board rules. The owner’s license for Grand Victoria was issued in October 1994 and was
valid for three years. Since that time, the license has been renewed annually, and in
October 2000, the license was renewed for four years. Mandalay has submitted to the
Illinois Board its application to renew its license again in October 2004. However, as
discussed in more detail below, the Illinois Board currently has only two acting members
and, therefore, cannot achieve a quorum or take any action.



Despite the Illinois Board’s current inability to renew any license, MGM MIRAGE
understands that the Illinois Board notified Mandalay that the Illinois Administrative
Procedures Act allows Mandalay’s gaming license to continue in full force and effect
until such time as the Illinois Board is able to take action. An ownership interest in
an owner’s license may not be transferred or pledged as collateral without the prior
approval of the Illinois Board.

Through the proposed merger with Mandalay, MGM MIRAGE ultimately intends to acquire
control of Mandalay’s ownership interest in the entity that possesses the owner’s
license in connection with the Grand Victoria. In addition, MGM MIRAGE and two of its
representatives have applied to the Illinois Board to become “Key Persons” (discussed
below) in the operations at the Grand Victoria. Pursuant to the amended Illinois Act,
which lifted the 10% ownership prohibition, the Illinois Board established certain rules
to follow in deciding whether to approve direct or indirect ownership or control of an
owner’s license. The Illinois Board must consider the impact of any economic
concentration of the ownership or control. No direct or indirect ownership or control
may be approved which will result in undue economic concentration of the ownership of a
riverboat gambling operation in Illinois. Undue economic concentration means that a
person or entity would have actual or potential domination of riverboat gambling in
Illinois sufficient to:

•

substantially impede or suppress competition among holders of owner’s licenses;

•

adversely impact the economic stability of the riverboat casino industry in Illinois; or

•

negatively impact the purposes of the Illinois Act, including tourism, economic
development, benefits to local communities and state and local revenues.

The Illinois Board will consider the following criteria in determining whether the
approval of the issuance, transfer or holding of a license will create undue economic
concentration:

The Illinois Act does not limit the maximum bet or per patron loss. Minimum and
maximum wagers on games are set by the holder of the owner’s license. Wagering may not
be conducted with money or other negotiable currency. No person under the age of 21 is
permitted to wager and wagers only may be received from a person present on the
riverboat. With respect to electronic gaming devices, the payout percentage may not be
less than 80% nor more than 100%.

An admission tax is imposed on the owner of a riverboat operation. Under the 2003
amendments to the Illinois Act, the admission tax is $4.00 per person for an owner
licensee that admitted 2,300,000 persons or fewer in the previous calendar year, and
$5.00 per person for an owner licensee that admitted more than 2,300,000 persons in the
previous calendar year (including Grand Victoria).



Additionally, a wagering tax is imposed on the adjusted gross receipts, as defined
in the initial Illinois Act, of a riverboat operation. As of July 1, 2003, pursuant to
the 2003 amendments, the wagering tax was increased as follows:

The wagering tax as outlined in the 2003 amendments shall no longer be imposed
beginning on the earlier of (i) July 1, 2005; (ii) the first date after the effective
date of the 2003 amendments to the Illinois Act that riverboat gambling operations are
conducted pursuant to the dormant tenth license; or (iii) the first day that riverboat
gambling operations are conducted under the authority of an owners license that is in
addition to the 10 owners licenses authorized by the Illinois Act. The wagering tax will
rollback to the rates in effect prior to the 2003 amendments. The owner licensee is
required, on a daily basis, to wire the wagering tax payment to the Illinois Board.

In addition to owner’s licenses, the Illinois Board also requires licensing for all
vendors of gaming supplies and equipment and for all employees of a riverboat gaming
operation. The Illinois Board is authorized to conduct investigations into the conduct
of gaming and into alleged violations of the Illinois Act and the Illinois Board rules.
Employees and agents of the Illinois Board have access to and may inspect any facilities
relating to the riverboat gaming operation.

A holder of any license is subject to imposition of fines, suspension or revocation
of such license, or other action for any act or failure to act by himself or his agents
or employees, that is injurious to the public health, safety, morals, good order and
general welfare of the people of the State of Illinois, or that would discredit or tend
to discredit the Illinois gaming industry or the State of Illinois. Any riverboat
operations not conducted in compliance with the Illinois Act may constitute an illegal
gaming place and consequently may be subject to criminal penalties, including possible
seizure, confiscation and destruction of illegal gaming devices and seizure and sale of
riverboats and dock facilities to pay any unsatisfied judgment that may be recovered and
any unsatisfied fine that may be levied. The Illinois Act also provides for civil
penalties, equal to the amount of gross receipts derived from wagering on the gaming,
whether unauthorized or authorized, conducted on the day of any violation. The Illinois
Board may revoke or suspend licenses, as the Illinois Board may see fit and in
compliance with applicable laws of the State of Illinois regarding administrative
procedures and may suspend an owner’s license, without notice or hearing, upon a
determination that the safety or health of patrons or employees is jeopardized by
continuing a riverboat’s operation. The suspension may remain in effect until the
Illinois Board determines that the cause for suspension has been abated and it may
revoke the owner’s license upon a determination that the owner has not made satisfactory
progress toward abating the hazard.

If the Illinois Board has suspended, revoked or refused to renew the license of an
owner or if a riverboat gambling operation is closing and the owner is voluntarily
surrendering its owner’s license, the Illinois Board may petition the local circuit
court in which the riverboat is situated for appointment of a receiver. The circuit
court shall have sole jurisdiction over any and all issues pertaining to the appointment
of a receiver.



The Illinois Board shall specify the specific powers, duties and limitations for
the receiver, including but not limited to the authority to:

The Illinois Board shall submit at least three nominees to the court. The nominees
may be individuals or entities selected from an Illinois Board approved list of
pre-qualified receivers who meet the same criteria for a finding of preliminary
suitability for licensure under Illinois Board rules. In the event that the Illinois
Board seeks the appointment of a receiver on a emergency basis, the Illinois Board shall
issue a temporary operating permit to the receiver appointed by the court. A receiver,
upon appointment by the court, shall before assuming his or her duties, execute and post
the same bond as an owner’s licensee pursuant to the Illinois Act.

The receiver shall function as an independent contractor, subject to the direction
of the court. However, the receiver shall also provide to the Illinois Board regular
reports and provide any information deemed necessary for the Illinois Board to ascertain
the receiver’s compliance with all applicable rules and laws. From time to time, the
Illinois Board may, at its sole discretion, report to the court on the receiver’s level
of compliance and any other information deemed appropriate for disclosure to the court.
The term and compensation of the receiver shall be set by the court. The receiver shall
provide to the court and the Illinois Board at least 30 days written notice of any
intent to withdraw from the appointment or to seek modification of the appointment.
Except as otherwise provided by action of the Illinois Board, the gaming operation shall
be deemed a licensed operation subject to all rules of the Illinois Board during the
tenure of any receivership.

The Illinois Board requires that a “Key Person” of an owner licensee submit a
Personal Disclosure or Business Entity Form and be investigated and approved by the
Illinois Board. MGM MIRAGE and two of its representatives have applied to the Illinois
Board to become Key Persons of the owner licensee that operates the Grand Victoria. The
Illinois Board shall certify for each applicant for or holder of an owner’s license each
position, individual or Business Entity that is to be approved by the Board and maintain
suitability as a Key Person.

With respect to an applicant for or the holder of an owner’s license, a Key Person
shall include:

•

any Business Entity and any individual with an ownership interest or voting
rights of more than 5% in the licensee or applicant and the trustee of any trust
holding such ownership interest or voting rights;

•

the directors of the licensee or applicant and its chief executive officer,
president and chief operating officer or their functional equivalents; and

•

all other individuals or Business Entities that, upon review of the applicant’s
or licensees Table of Organization, Ownership and Control the Board determines hold
a position or a level of ownership, control or influence that is material to the
regulatory concerns and obligations of the Illinois Board for the specified
licensee or applicant.



In order to assist the Illinois Board in its determination of Key Persons,
applicants for or holders of an owner’s license must provide to the Illinois Board a
Table of Organization, Ownership and Control (the “Table”). The Table must identify in
sufficient detail the hierarchy of individuals and Business Entities that, through
direct or indirect means, manage, own or control the interest and assets of the
applicant or licensee holder. If a Business Entity identified in the Table is a publicly
traded company, the following information must be provided in the Table:

•

the name and percentage of ownership interest of each individual or Business
Entity with ownership of more than 5% of the voting shares of the entity, to the
extent this information is known or contained in Schedule 13D or 13G filings with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”);

•

to the extent known, the names and percentage of interest of ownership of
persons who are relatives of one another and who together (as individuals or
through trusts) exercise control over or own more than 10% of the voting shares of
the entity; and

•

any trust holding more than 5% ownership or voting interest in the entity, to
the extent this information is known or contained in Schedule 13D or 13G SEC
filings.

The Table may be disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act.

Each owner licensee must provide a means for the economic disassociation of a Key
Person in the event such economic disassociation is required by an order of the Illinois
Board. Based upon findings from an investigation into the character, reputation,
experience, associations, business probity and financial integrity of a Key Person, the
Illinois Board may enter an order upon the licensee or require the economic
disassociation of the Key Person.

Furthermore, each applicant or owner licensee must disclose the identity of every
person, association, trust or corporation having a greater than 1% direct or indirect
pecuniary interest in an owner licensee or in the riverboat gaming operation with
respect to which the license is sought. The Illinois Board also may require an applicant
or owner licensee to disclose any other principal or investor and require the
investigation and approval of these individuals.

The Illinois Board (unless the investor qualifies as an institutional investor)
requires a Personal Disclosure Form or a Business Entity Form from any person or entity
who or which, individually or in association with others, acquires directly or
indirectly, beneficial ownership of more than 5% of any class of voting securities or
non-voting securities convertible into voting securities of a publicly-traded
corporation which holds an ownership interest in the holder of an owner’s license. If
the Illinois Board denies an application for such a transfer and if no hearing is
requested, the applicant for the transfer of ownership interest must promptly divest
those shares in the publicly-traded parent corporation. The holder of an owner’s license
would not be able to distribute profits to a publicly-traded parent corporation until
such shares have been divested. If a hearing is requested, the shares need not be
divested and profits may be distributed to a publicly-held parent corporation pending
the issuance of a final order from the Illinois Board.

An institutional investor that individually or jointly with others, cumulatively
acquires, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of any class of voting securities of a
publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s publicly-traded parent corporation shall,
within no less than ten days after acquiring these securities, notify the Administrator
of the Illinois Board of such ownership and shall provide any additional information as
may be required. If an institutional investor (as specified above) acquires 10% or more
of any class of voting securities of a publicly-traded licensee or a licensee’s
publicly-traded parent corporation it shall file an Institutional Investor Disclosure
Form within 45 days after acquiring this level of ownership interest. The owner licensee
shall notify the Administrator as soon as possible after it becomes aware that it or its
parent is involved in an ownership acquisition by an institutional investor. The
institutional investor also has an obligation to notify the Administrator of its
ownership interest.

In addition to Institutional Investor Disclosure Forms, certain other forms may be
required to be submitted to the Illinois Board. An owner-licensee must submit a
Marketing Agent Form to the Illinois Board for each Marketing Agent with whom it intends
to do business. A Marketing Agent is a person or entity, other than a junketeer or an
employee of a riverboat gaming operation, who is compensated by the riverboat gaming
operation in excess of $100 per patron per trip for identifying and recruiting patrons.
Key Persons of owner-licensees must submit Trust Identification Forms for trusts,
excluding land trusts, for which they are a grantor, trustee or beneficiary each time
such a trust relationship is established, amended or terminated.



Applicants for and holders of an owner’s license are required to obtain formal
approval from the Illinois Board for changes in the following areas:

A holder of an owner’s license is allowed to make distributions to its stockholders
only to the extent that the distribution would not impair the financial viability of the
gaming operation. Factors to be considered by the licensee will include but not be
limited to the following:

The Illinois Board has implemented a Voluntary Self-Exclusion Policy whereby a
person who acknowledges that he/she has a gambling problem may self-identify and
self-exclude himself or herself from an Illinois riverboat. The Illinois Board has
prescribed procedures that owner licensees must follow in order to implement this
self-exclusion program.

The Illinois Board may waive any licensing requirement or procedure provided by
rule if it determines that the waiver is in the best interests of the public and the
gaming industry. Also, the Illinois Board may, from time to time, amend or change its
rules.

Uncertainty exists regarding the Illinois gambling regulatory environment due to
limited experience in interpreting the Illinois Act.

From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in the Illinois
legislature that, if enacted, would affect the taxation, regulation, operation or other
aspects of the gaming industry. Some of this legislation, if enacted, could adversely
affect the gaming industry. No assurance can be given whether such or similar
legislation will be enacted.

In April 2004, one member of the five-member Illinois Board failed to receive the
approval of the Illinois Senate with respect to his appointment to the Illinois Board,
and, thus, immediately ceased to be a member of the Illinois Board. In late August 2004,
two more members of the five-member Illinois Board resigned. To date, none of these
former members have been replaced. The two remaining members of the Illinois Board do
not constitute the required quorum under the Illinois Act. Consequently, the Illinois
Board may not take any action until at least one additional member is appointed. There
can be no assurance that the Illinois Board’s current inability to achieve a quorum will
not cause a delay in the Illinois Board’s consideration of the proposed merger with
Mandalay, MGM MIRAGE’s acquisition of Mandalay’s joint venture interest in the Grand
Victoria, or the various licensing applications submitted to the Illinois Board by MGM
MIRAGE and certain of its affiliates as a result of the proposed merger with Mandalay.



Factors that May Affect Our Future Results

(Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)

This Form 10-K and our 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders contain some
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or
forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do
not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They contain words such as
“anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “may,”
“could,” “might” and other words or phrases of similar meaning in connection with any
discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
statements relating to future actions, new projects, future performance, the outcome of
contingencies such as legal proceedings and future financial results. From time to
time, we also provide oral or written forward-looking statements in our Forms 10-Q and
8-K, press releases and other materials we release to the public. Any or all of our
forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K, in our 2004 Annual Report to Stockholders
and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be
affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and
uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in this Form 10-K — for example, government
regulation and the competitive environment — will be important in determining our future
results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Our actual
future results may differ materially.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements,
whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised,
however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form
10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also note that we
provide the following discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate
assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that we think could cause our
actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors
in addition to those listed here could also adversely affect us. This discussion is
provided as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

•

We have significant indebtedness. At December 31, 2004, we had approximately
$5.5 billion of indebtedness and we will assume or incur
significant  additional indebtedness in connection with the Mandalay
merger. While a large portion of our long-term debt was
fixed-rate debt at December 31, 2004, the anticipated financing for the Mandalay
acquisition is largely variable-rate debt. Therefore, the interest rate on a large
portion of our long-term debt will be subject to fluctuation based on changes in
short-term interest rates and the ratings which national rating agencies assign to
our outstanding debt securities. Our current and anticipated bank credit
agreements and the indentures governing our debt securities do not prohibit us from
borrowing additional funds in the future. Our interest expense could increase as a
result of these factors. Additionally, our indebtedness could increase our
vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limit our
flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and industry,
limit our ability to borrow additional funds and place us at a competitive
disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors. Our ability to reduce
our outstanding debt will be subject to our future cash flows, other capital
requirements and other factors, some of which are not within our control.

•

Our casinos in Las Vegas and elsewhere are destination resorts that compete with
other destination travel locations throughout the United States and the world. We
do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and
gaming operations in other states or countries could attract our customers. To the
extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by
others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major
competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room
capacity or are currently constructing new rooms in Las Vegas. In addition, a new
casino resort is under construction in Las Vegas and is scheduled to open in 2005,
which will likely significantly increase competition for our casinos. Also, the
recent growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas, including California, has
increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. In
particular, as additional large scale gaming operations in Native American tribal
lands increase, competition will increase.

•

Voters in California approved an amendment to the California constitution in
March 2000 that gave Native American tribes in California the right to offer a
limited number of slot machines and a range of house-banked card games. More than
60 compacts had been approved by the federal government as of December 31, 2004,
and casino-style gaming is legal in California on those tribal lands. According to
the California Gambling Control Commission, there were more than 50 operating
tribal casinos in California as of May 17, 2004. The expansion of Native American
gaming in California has already impacted our Primm Valley Resorts. Several
Native American tribes in California recently reached agreements with the State of
California that allow for increased number of gaming machines within such tribes in
exchange for a revenue-based payment to the state. Such expansion of gaming in
California could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.







•

Tracinda Corporation beneficially owns approximately 58% of our outstanding
common stock as of December 31, 2004. As a result, Tracinda Corporation has the
ability to elect our entire Board of Directors and determine the outcome of other
matters submitted to our stockholders, such as the approval of significant
transactions.

You should also be aware that while we from time to time communicate with
securities analysts, we do not disclose to them any material non-public information,
internal forecasts or other confidential business information. Therefore, you should
not assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any analyst,
irrespective of the content of the statement or report. To the extent that reports
issued by securities analysts contain projections, forecasts or opinions, those reports
are not our responsibility.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Prior
to February 2005, substantially all of the Company’s assets other than assets of its foreign
subsidiaries and certain assets in use at MGM Grand Detroit were pledged as
collateral for our senior notes and principal credit facilities. As a
result of the redemption of our 6.875% Senior Notes due February
2008 and the repayment of our 6.95% Senior Notes due February 2005,
we applied for, for received, release of collateral under our credit
facility and senior notes.

Bellagio occupies an approximately 80-acre site. We own the entire site except for
one acre which we lease under a ground lease that expires (giving effect to our options
to renew) in 2073. Approximately 13 acres of this site will be utilized as part of
our 66-acre Project CityCenter. Our principal executive offices are located at Bellagio. MGM Grand
Las Vegas occupies an approximately 113-acre site which we own. In 2004, we contributed
3 acres to the venture formed with Turnberry Associates to develop luxury condominium
towers behind MGM Grand Las Vegas. The Mirage and TI share an approximately 100-acre
site which we own. New York-New York occupies an approximately 20-acre site which we
own.

The Primm Valley Resorts are located on approximately 143 acres. We lease
substantially all of the land under a ground lease that expires (giving effect to our
renewal option) in 2068. We own approximately 16 acres immediately north of Buffalo
Bill’s. We also own approximately 573 acres in California, four miles south of Primm,
which is the location of the Primm Valley Golf Club. Approximately 125 of these acres
remain available for future development. Primm Valley Resorts are not served by a
municipal water system. We have rights to water in various wells located on federal
land in the vicinity of the Primm Valley Resorts and have received permits to pipe the
water to the Primm Valley Resorts. These permits and rights are subject to the
jurisdiction and ongoing regulatory authority of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the
States of Nevada and California and local governmental units. We believe that adequate
water for the Primm Valley Resorts is available; however, we cannot be certain that the
future needs will be within the permitted allowance. Also, we can give no assurance
that any future requests for additional water will be approved or that no further
requirements will be imposed by governmental agencies on our use and delivery of water
for the Primm Valley Resorts.

Boardwalk occupies an approximately 8 acre site which we own. We also own
approximately 45 acres of property adjacent to Boardwalk. These 53 acres will be
utilized for Project CityCenter. Monte Carlo occupies approximately 46 acres owned by
Victoria Partners (the joint venture that owns and operates Monte Carlo). We own
approximately 306 acres of land in North Las Vegas, including 240 acres occupied by
Shadow Creek.

MGM Grand Detroit is located on approximately 8 acres which we own. Beau Rivage
occupies approximately 41 acres (including 10 acres of tidelands) in Biloxi,
Mississippi. We own the land and we lease the tidelands from the State of Mississippi
under a lease that expires (giving effect to our option to renew) in 2049. We also own
approximately 508 acres in the Biloxi area for development of the planned Fallen Oak
golf course.

We own approximately 150 acres in Atlantic City consisting principally of three
different parcels in casino-zoned areas. Borgata occupies 29 acres at Renaissance
Pointe, including two acres we lease to Borgata and on which Borgata constructed its
employee parking garage. The remaining 27 acres Borgata occupies is owned by the
venture and collateralized by a mortgage securing bank credit facilities in the amount
of up to $650 million. As of December 31, 2004, $426 million was outstanding under the
bank credit facility.

We also own or lease various other improved and unimproved property in Las Vegas
and other locations in the United States and certain foreign countries.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Poulos Slot Machine Litigation

On April 26, 1994, an individual filed a complaint in a class action lawsuit in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against 41
manufacturers, distributors and casino operators of video poker and electronic slot
machines, including the Company. On May 10, 1994, another plaintiff filed a complaint
in a class action lawsuit alleging substantially the same claims in the same court
against 48 defendants, including the Company. On September 26, 1995, another plaintiff
filed a complaint in a class action lawsuit alleging substantially the same claims in
the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against 45 defendants,
including the Company. The court consolidated the three cases in the United States
District Court for the District of Nevada.



The consolidated complaint claims that we and the other defendants have engaged in
a course of fraudulent and misleading conduct intended to induce people to play video
poker and electronic slot machines based on a false belief concerning how the gaming
machines operate, as well as the chances of winning. Specifically, the plaintiffs
allege that the gaming machines are not truly random as advertised to the public, but
are pre-programmed in a predictable and manipulative manner. The complaint alleges
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, as well as claims
of common law fraud, unjust enrichment and negligent misrepresentation, and asks for
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. In December 1997, the court granted in
part and denied in part the defendants’ motions to dismiss the complaint for failure to
state a claim and ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which they filed
in February 1998. We, along with most of the other defendants, answered the amended
complaint and continue to deny the allegations contained in the amended complaint. The
parties have fully briefed the issues regarding class certification, which are currently
pending before the court.

In June 2002, the U.S. District Court in Nevada ruled that the plaintiffs met the
prerequisite requirements for class-action status, but the Court denied the plaintiffs’
motion for class action certification, saying that the proposed class lacked the
cohesiveness required to settle common claims against the casino industry. The court
had previously stayed discovery pending resolution of these class certification issues.
In August 2004, the 9

th

Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District
Court’s ruling denying class-action status for the case. In November 2004, the District
Court set a discovery deadline of April 2005 and a trial date in September 2005.

Boardwalk Shareholder Litigation

On September 28, 1999, a former stockholder of our subsidiary which owns and
operates the Boardwalk Hotel and Casino filed a first amended complaint in a putative
class action lawsuit in District Court for Clark County, Nevada against Mirage and
certain former directors and principal stockholders of the Boardwalk subsidiary. The
complaint alleged that Mirage induced the other defendants to breach their fiduciary
duties to Boardwalk’s minority stockholders by devising and implementing a scheme by
which Mirage acquired Boardwalk at significantly less than the true value of its shares.
The complaint sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages from Mirage and
punitive damages from the other defendants, whom we are required to defend and
indemnify.

In June 2000, the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to
state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The plaintiff appealed the ruling to
the Nevada Supreme Court. The parties filed briefs with the Nevada Supreme Court, and
oral arguments were conducted in October 2001. In February 2003, the Nevada Supreme
Court overturned the District Court’s order granting our motion to dismiss the complaint
and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings on the elements of
the lawsuit involving wrongful conduct in approving the merger and/or in the valuation
of the merged corporation’s shares. The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed the District
Court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims for lost profits and mismanagement. The
Nevada Supreme Court’s ruling relates only to the District Court’s ruling on our motion
to dismiss and is not a determination of the merits of the plaintiff’s case. The
plaintiff filed an amended complaint, and in November 2003, the District Court certified
the action as a class action.

Discovery, except for expert discovery, is now closed. The defendants filed a
motion for summary judgment which the court continued on two occasions. The
District Court previously continued the hearing due to the plaintiffs’ failure to
present evidence to support its allegations that Boardwalk’s common stock had a market
value of more than $5.00 per share at the time of the merger. The District Court
granted summary judgment in our favor in March 2005, which may be appealed. We will continue to
vigorously defend our position that the Plaintiffs’ claims are without merit.

Detroit Slot Machine Litigation

On July 18, 2001, an individual, Mary Kraft, filed a complaint in the Wayne County
Circuit Court in Detroit, Michigan, against International Game Technology, Anchor
Gaming, Inc. and the three operators of casinos in Detroit, Michigan, including a
subsidiary of the Company. The plaintiff claims the bonus wheel feature of the Wheel of
Fortune® and I Dream of Jeannie™ slot machines, which are manufactured, designed and
programmed by International Game Technology and/or Anchor Gaming, Inc., are deceptive
and misleading. Specifically, plaintiff alleges that the bonus wheels on these games do
not randomly land on a given dollar amount but are programmed to provide a predetermined
frequency of pay-outs. The complaint alleges violations of the Michigan Consumer
Protection Act, common law fraud and unjust enrichment and asks for unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages, disgorgement of profits, injunctive and other
equitable relief, and costs and attorney’s fees. The plaintiff seeks to certify a class
of any individual in Michigan who has played either of these games since June of 1999.
The machines and their programs were approved for use by the Michigan Gaming Control
Board, the administrative agency responsible for policing the Detroit casinos.



We, along with the other casino operators, filed a motion for summary disposition
arguing that the plaintiff’s complaint fails to state a claim as a matter of law.
Additionally, we, along with the other casino operators, filed motions for summary
disposition arguing that the plaintiff’s common law claims are preempted by the Michigan
Act, that the court has no jurisdiction to decide this matter and that all the
allegations in the complaint regarding the alleged deceptive nature of the machines are
directed to the manufacturers of the machines and are not the casinos’ responsibility.
In April 2002, the Wayne County Circuit Court granted the motion for summary
disposition. The plaintiff appealed and, after a full briefing of the case, oral
argument was held in November 2003.

In April 2004, the Michigan Court of Appeals, an intermediate appellate court,
affirmed the trial court’s dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims. The Michigan Court of
Appeals held that the plaintiff’s claims are exempt from the Michigan Consumer
Protection Act because the operation of the slot machines was specifically authorized by
the Michigan Gaming Control Board, and that the plaintiff’s common law claims are
pre-empted by the Michigan Act. The plaintiff did not seek review of the appellate
court decision by the Michigan Supreme Court and, therefore, the decision of the
Michigan Court of Appeals is final.

Lac Vieux Litigation

In January 2002, the 6

th

Circuit Court of Appeals ruled, in the case of
Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians v. Michigan Gaming Control
Board, et. al., that a preference contained in the Detroit Casino Selection Process
Ordinance, in Detroit, Michigan, violated the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution. The 6

th

Circuit Court remanded the case to the Federal
District Court to determine what relief was appropriate. The Company’s operating
subsidiary had not been granted a preference by the City of Detroit, and was not
originally a party to the Lac Vieux litigation. In April 2002, such subsidiary
intervened in the Lac Vieux litigation in order to protect its interest.

In July 2002, the District Court denied the Lac Vieux Tribe’s request for a new
casino development selection process in the City of Detroit, finding that the magnitude
of such relief was not warranted and that the harm to the casino licensees and the City
would be manifestly worse than any benefit the Tribe might receive. The District Court
declared that our subsidiary did not receive a preference and, in fact, was injured by
the preference. The Federal District Court determined that the only relief that it
could equitably grant to the Tribe was declaring the ordinance unconstitutional. Our
subsidiary had previously petitioned the Court for a ruling that its selection was valid
in that it did not receive any preferences in the selection process. In light of the
ruling that no further relief would be granted to the Tribe, the Court denied this
motion on the ground of mootness. The Tribe appealed the District Court’s ruling, and
the Tribe requested that the District Court enjoin the City from approving new
development agreements with the three casino developers until resolution of the appeal
by the 6

th

Circuit Court. The District Court denied the request for the
injunction, and the appeal is pending. Our subsidiary filed a cross-appeal of the
District Court’s denial of the subsidiary’s motion. The
cross-appeal is pending.

In September 2002, the 6

th

Circuit Court issued an injunction, pending
appeal, prohibiting the City from issuing construction permits to the developers and
prohibiting the developers from commencing construction pending further action of the

th

Circuit Court. The parties completed briefing of the case in August
2003. We argued, among other things, that the preference provisions of the ordinance
found unconstitutional are severable from the valid provisions of the ordinance, and
that our subsidiary was not eligible for and did not seek or receive a preference in the
selection process. The 6

th

Circuit Court has not set a schedule for argument
of the appeal.

In December 2003, the Tribe and the owners of the two other casinos filed a joint
motion with the 6

th

Circuit Court requesting approval of the terms of a
partial settlement, asserted to have resolved the case among the filing parties. The
settlement calls for exemption of those developers from a reselection process and other
related relief, in exchange for cash payments to the Tribe, but purports to continue the
Tribe’s appeal as it relates to our subsidiary. In a subsequent filing, the settling
parties requested that issues pertaining to this partial settlement be remanded to the
District Court for consideration. We filed a responsive motion with the 6th Circuit
Court requesting dismissal of the appeal as moot, or, upon denial of such relief,
expedited decision of our cross-appeal and a full briefing on the issues surrounding the
proposed partial settlement.

In February 2004, the 6

th

Circuit Court remanded the proposed settlement
to the District Court for review and approval. In remanding the case, the

th

Circuit Court directed that the non-settling parties should not be
prejudiced by the actions of the settling parties.



In April 2004, the District Court issued a ruling approving the proposed settlement
among Lac Vieux, Greektown Casino and Detroit Entertainment/Atwater. As to the position
of the Company’s subsidiary in the case, the District Court’s settlement opinion
observed that Lac Vieux’s proposed relief of rebidding of the subsidiary’s casino
development would be inequitable to our subsidiary, since our subsidiary was not
eligible for, did not seek and did not receive any preferential treatment in the casino
selection process. The District Court also stated that Lac Vieux’s agreement in the
settlement not to pursue rebidding of the developments of the two parties who did
receive preferences strengthens our subsidiary’s legal position that a rebidding of only
one casino development would make the rebidding process even more inequitable as to our
subsidiary.

In May 2004, our subsidiary filed a notice of appeal to the 6

th

Circuit
Court of the District Court’s approval of the proposed consent judgment in order to
preserve certain issues regarding the appropriateness of remedies for further briefing
and argument should the Tribe prevail in its appeal and our subsidiary not prevail in
its cross-appeal. Our subsidiary followed with a motion for scheduling of review of all
matters remaining before the 6

th

Circuit Court. Aside from review of the
District Court’s approval of the settlement, several other matters in the litigation
remain pending before the 6

th

Circuit, including our subsidiary’s motion to
dismiss Lac Vieux’s appeal on the grounds that the settlement makes the appeal moot; Lac
Vieux’s continuing appeal and request for a rebid as to our subsidiary’s Detroit casino
development; our subsidiary’s cross-appeal of the District Court’s denial of the
subsidiary’s request for declaratory ruling that it should not be subject to rebid
because it never received a preference in the developer selection process; and the
injunction prohibiting construction of permanent casino complexes pending further action
by the 6

th

Circuit Court.

In June 2004, the 6

th

Circuit Court issued an order directing the
parties to file letter briefs stating their respective positions on questions posed by
that court concerning what parties and issues would remain to be decided if the

th

Circuit Court approved the settlement and dissolved the injunction. All
parties filed letter briefs in response to the 6

th

Circuit Court’s directive.
In December 2004, the 6

th

Circuit ordered that the parties provide briefs
regarding (i) our subsidiary’s appeal of the District Court’s approval of the proposed
consent judgment, (ii) whether the injunction pending appeal should be lifted and, if
so, as to what parties, and (iii) whether oral argument is
requested. The parties completed briefing of this appeal in February
2005. The timetable for the 6

th

Circuit’s further review of this case is uncertain. Our subsidiary intends to continue
to vigorously defend its positions in this case.

Other

We and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other lawsuits, most of
which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. We do not believe that the
outcome of this other pending litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a
material adverse effect on the Company.

There were approximately 3,505 record holders of our common stock as of March 1,
2005.

We have not paid dividends on our common stock in the last two fiscal years. We
intend to retain our earnings to fund the operation of our business, to service and
repay our debt, to make strategic investments in high return growth projects at our
proven resorts, to repurchase shares of common stock and to reserve our capital to raise
our capacity to capture investment opportunities overseas and in emerging domestic
markets. Furthermore, as a holding company with no independent operations, our ability
to pay dividends will depend upon the receipt of dividends and other payment from our
subsidiaries. Our senior credit facility contains financial covenants that could
restrict our ability to pay dividends. Our Board of Directors periodically reviews our
policy with respect to dividends, and any determination to pay dividends in the future
will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.

On December 13, 1999, the Board of Directors approved an initial quarterly cash
dividend of $0.10 per share to stockholders of record on February 10, 2000. The dividend
was paid on March 1, 2000. As a result of the acquisition of Mirage Resorts, Incorporated,
we announced on April 19, 2000 that the quarterly dividend policy was discontinued.

The
acquisition of Mirage occurred on May 31, 2000. In June 2003, we ceased operations of
PLAYMGMMIRAGE.com, our online gaming website (“Online”). In January 2004, we sold the Golden
Nugget Las Vegas and the Golden Nugget Laughlin including substantially all of the assets and
liabilities of those resorts (the “Golden Nugget Subsidiaries”). In July 2004, we sold the
subsidiaries that own and operate MGM Grand Australia. The results of Online, the Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries and MGM Grand Australia are classified as discontinued operations for all periods
presented.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

At December 31, 2004, our operations consisted of 11 wholly-owned casino resorts
and 50% investments in two other casino resorts, including:

Las Vegas, Nevada:

Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, The Mirage, TI, New York-New York, Boardwalk, and Monte Carlo (50% owned).

Other:

The Primm Valley Resorts (Buffalo Bill’s, Primm Valley Resort and Whiskey Pete’s) in Primm, Nevada; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; MGM Grand Detroit; Borgata (50% owned) in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

We operate in one segment, the operation of casino resorts, which includes offering
gaming, hotel, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. Slightly over
half of our net revenues are derived from gaming activities, a lower percentage than
many of our competitors, as our operating philosophy is to provide a complete resort
experience for our guests, including non-gaming amenities which
command premium prices based on their quality.

We generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income from our Las Vegas
Strip resorts. In 2004, over 75% of our net revenues and operating income was generated
by wholly-owned Las Vegas Strip resorts. We believe that we own the premier casino
resorts on the Las Vegas Strip, and a main focus of our strategy is to continually
reinvest in these resorts to maintain that competitive advantage. Our concentration on
the Las Vegas Strip exposes us to certain risks outside of our control, such as
competition from other Las Vegas Strip resorts as well as new or
expanded resorts in Las Vegas, including Wynn Las Vegas expected to
open in 2005, and the impact from potential expansion of gaming in California. This
concentration also exposes us to risks related to tourism and the general economy,
including national and global economic conditions and terrorist attacks or other global
events.

Key Performance Indicators

As a resort-based company, our operating results are highly dependent on the volume
of customers at our resorts, which in turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel
rooms and other amenities. We also generate a significant portion of our operating
income from the high-end gaming segment, which can cause variability in our results.
Key performance indicators related to revenue are:

•

Gaming revenue indicators – table games drop and slot handle (volume
indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us.
Our normal table games win percentage is in the range of 18% to 22% of table
games drop and our normal slot win percentage is in the range of 6% to 7% of
slot handle;

•

Hotel revenue indicators – hotel occupancy (volume indicator); average daily
rate (“ADR”, price indicator); revenue per available room (“REVPAR”), a summary
measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate.

Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers wagering with cash
or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. Our resorts, like many in
the industry, generate significant operating cash flow. Our industry is capital
intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash
flow to repay debt financing, fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess
cash for future development.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of
factors can affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major Las
Vegas conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our
high-end customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and
Chinese New Year.



Overall Outlook

We have invested heavily in our existing operations in 2003 and 2004, and expect to
continue to do so on a targeted basis in 2005. Our Las Vegas Strip resorts require
ongoing capital investment to maintain their competitive advantages. We believe the
investments in additional non-gaming amenities we made in 2003 and 2004 have enhanced
our ability to generate increased visitor volume and allowed us to charge premium prices
for our amenities.

The most likely significant factors affecting operating results at our existing
resorts in 2005 will be the expected continued strength of the leisure and convention
travel segments, the expansion of Bellagio and the opening of

KÀ

and other amenities at
MGM Grand Las Vegas, and new competition from Wynn Las Vegas on the Las Vegas Strip.
Various lodging market observers, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers and Smith Travel
Research, are forecasting mid-single digit percentage growth in REVPAR in 2005, with
greater REVPAR gains in full service hotels. Our REVPAR growth, and REVPAR growth in
Las Vegas in general, has outpaced that of the national market, and we expect that trend
to continue.

The Bellagio expansion opened in late 2004 and added over 30% to the resort’s room
base. In addition, we added new meeting, retail and dining space and significantly
expanded the spa and salon.

KÀ

opened in late November 2004 at MGM Grand Las Vegas,
which had been without a featured production show for almost two years. Along with the
numerous restaurant and other entertainment additions at MGM Grand Las Vegas,

KÀ

will
enhance our ability to generate visitor traffic and capture a greater share of our
guests’ spending.

Wynn Las Vegas will add room capacity to the Las Vegas market, with its 2,700 rooms
representing a 2% increase in Las Vegas room supply. Wynn Las Vegas will also feature
numerous upscale restaurants and generally target customers who might otherwise choose
Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas or The Mirage. We believe there will be some impact on
these resorts from Wynn Las Vegas, but also believe that the breadth of amenities in our
portfolio of resorts and our loyalty and other marketing programs will help minimize
these competitive pressures. The proximity of Wynn Las Vegas to TI and The Mirage,
along with pedestrian bridges linking TI with the Fashion Show Mall and Venetian, will
also benefit these resorts.

Mandalay Merger

On June 16, 2004, we announced that we had entered into a definitive merger
agreement with Mandalay Resort Group (“Mandalay”), a publicly traded company, under
which we will acquire Mandalay for $71.00 in cash for each share of common stock of
Mandalay. Mandalay owns and operates eleven properties in Nevada, including Mandalay
Bay, Luxor, Excalibur, Circus Circus, and Slots-A-Fun in Las Vegas, Circus Circus-Reno
in Reno, Colorado Belle and Edgewater in Laughlin, Gold Strike and Nevada Landing in
Jean, and Railroad Pass in Henderson. Mandalay also owns and operates Gold Strike, a
hotel/casino in Tunica County, Mississippi. In addition, Mandalay owns a 50% interest
in Silver Legacy in Reno, a 50% interest in Monte Carlo in Las Vegas, a 50% interest in
Grand Victoria, a riverboat in Elgin, Illinois, and a 53.5% interest in MotorCity in
Detroit, Michigan. The total consideration is approximately $8.1 billion, including
equity value of approximately $4.8 billion, convertible debentures with a redemption
value of approximately $574 million, the assumption or repayment of other outstanding
Mandalay debt with a fair value of approximately $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2004,
and $100 million of estimated transaction costs. The transaction is structured as a
merger of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into Mandalay. The transaction
will be accounted for as a purchase and is anticipated to close during the first quarter
of 2005.

The Mandalay merger will impact our operations in several ways. We will have to
integrate Mandalay’s operations into ours. This could require additional operating and
capital expenditures. However, we expect to achieve ongoing cost savings and revenue
enhancements from this process. We expect to realize efficiencies in operations and
economies of scale in purchasing, as well as more effectively market to a broader base
of customers. Our operating cash flow will increase substantially, as will our interest
and tax charges.

rooms and strong casino revenue. Operating margins correspondingly increased to 22% in 2004 from 18% in 2003 and
20% in 2002. Results on a per share basis were positively impacted by a lower weighted
average number of shares outstanding as the result of share repurchases throughout 2003
and 2004.

On a consolidated basis, the most important factors and trends contributing to our
operating performance over the last three years have been:

•

The war with Iraq and the outbreak of SARS in Asia, both of which negatively
impacted leisure travel and our high-end gaming business in late 2002 and early
2003;

•

The new labor contract covering our Las Vegas Strip employees since mid-2002,
which calls for significant annual wage and benefits increases through 2007;

•

The current economic recovery in the United States, which began to impact our
operations in the latter half of 2003 and continued to positively affect our
results in 2004.

•

The ongoing capital investments in upscale amenities at our resorts, which we
believe is allowing us to market more effectively to visitors, capture a greater
share of these visitors’ increased travel budgets, and generate premium pricing
for our resorts’ rooms and other amenities.

As a result of the above trends, our net revenues increased 10% in 2004, while
increasing only 3% in 2003. Net revenues at MGM Grand Las Vegas increased 14% in 2004,
due to the addition of several new restaurants, bars and other amenities, and in spite
of fewer rooms in service due to room remodel activity. Net revenues at New York-New
York increased 26% as the resort continues to benefit from

Zumanity

and Nine Fine
Irishmen, both of which opened in summer 2003. Net revenues at The Mirage decreased 2%
as the resort was without the Siegfried & Roy show and the buffet was closed for a
portion of the year while Cravings was constructed.



Our operating income in 2004 increased 36%, due primarily to the strong revenue
trends and a full year of Borgata’s results. The increase in income from unconsolidated
affiliates is responsible for approximately one-third of the increase in operating
income, while improvements at our operating resorts, particularly Bellagio, MGM Grand
Las Vegas and New York-New York, make up the rest of the increase. Operating income at
MGM Grand Detroit was essentially flat year-over-year, despite an increase in the gaming
tax rate from 18% to 24% effective September 2004. Several other factors largely
offset: Higher corporate expense due to increased development costs; lower bad debt
expense due to improved collections; lower preopening expenses due to Borgata preopening
expenses in 2003; and higher property transactions, net due to a $37 million gain on
sale of land in 2003.

In 2003, our operating income decreased by 6%. While revenues grew especially in
the second half of 2003, expense growth, particularly in payroll, outpaced revenues.

Table games revenues increased as a result of the improvements in the U.S. economy
and the general economy worldwide, as well as increased attendance at targeted marketing

events, including the New Years period. Total table games volume for the year was up
9%, with particular strength in baccarat volume, up 18%. These are the most significant
increases in table games volumes since 2000. Table games revenues decreased in 2003, as
a slightly lower hold percentage and the impact of the Iraq war and SARS outbreak in
early 2003 were not fully offset by strong volume levels over the latter half of 2003.
Table games win percentages were within our normal range for all periods presented.

Slot revenues increased substantially in both 2003 and 2004. Improvements were the
result of strong customer visitation, enhanced marketing programs, the impact of our
Players Club rewards program, and the implementation of cashless gaming technology in
2003. Slot win percentages were consistent among all three periods.

Non-casino revenue increased in 2004 primarily due to the enhanced amenities at our
resorts. In addition, we were able to increase the pricing for our rooms and other
non-gaming amenities. Our hotel results began to improve notably in the latter half of
2003, particularly at our Las Vegas Strip resorts. For the year ended December 31, 2004
REVPAR at our Las Vegas Strip resorts was $141 compared to $126 in 2003, an increase of
12%. Company-wide REVPAR was $121, an increase of 10% over 2003. This increase was
largely rate driven, as occupancy increased from 91% to 92% and ADR increased from $121
to $132. In 2003, company-wide REVPAR increased 6% from $104 to $110, with most of the
gains coming in the second half of the year.

In 2004, restructuring costs include $3 million for contract termination costs
related to the Aqua restaurant at Bellagio and $2 million of workforce reduction costs
at MGM Grand Detroit as a result of our efforts to minimize the impact of a gaming tax
increase in Michigan.

In 2003, our primary restructuring activities included closing two marketing
offices and terminating the related leases, terminating a lease agreement with a
restaurant tenant at MGM Grand Las Vegas, and closing the Siegfried & Roy show, which
resulted in a charge for employee severance costs.

In December 2002, we recorded a restructuring credit of $10 million related to a
lease contract termination accrual originally recorded in June 2000 as we determined
that payment under this obligation was not probable. We recorded $3 million of
restructuring charges in December 2002 related to contract termination costs for a
restaurant lease and the EFX! show at MGM Grand Las Vegas. In 2001, management
responded to a decline in business volumes caused by the September 11 attacks by
implementing cost containment strategies which included a significant reduction in
payroll and a refocusing of several of our marketing programs. This resulted in a $22
million charge against earnings. As a result of improving business levels and our
success at re-hiring a substantial number of previously laid off or terminated
employees, management determined in 2002 that a portion of the remaining accrual was no
longer necessary. This resulted in a restructuring credit of $10 million in 2002.

In 2004, there were no material unusual property transactions. In 2003, we sold
315 acres of land in North Las Vegas, Nevada near Shadow Creek for approximately $55
million, resulting in the $37 million gain reflected above. Prior to 2003, we
classified gains and losses on routine assets sales or disposals as a non-operating item
at some resorts and as an operating item at other resorts. We believe the preferable
presentation of these items is as an element of operating income. Prior period
statements have not been reclassified as such transactions were not material in periods
prior to 2003. Until 2003, demolition costs were typically capitalized as part of new
construction. We began expensing demolition costs on major construction projects as
incurred on January 1, 2003, and are accounting for this change in policy prospectively.
Demolition costs were not material in periods prior to 2003. Demolition costs in 2004
and 2003 related primarily to preparation for the Bellagio standard room remodel,
Bellagio expansion and new theatre at MGM Grand Las Vegas. Impairments of assets to be
disposed of in 2003 consisted primarily of assets related to the former EFX! show and
restaurants closed during 2003 at MGM Grand Las Vegas.

In 2002, Tropical Storm Isidore caused property damage at Beau Rivage totaling $8
million, including clean-up costs. The amount of the write-down for damaged assets was
determined based on the net book value of the assets and engineering estimates. In
connection with the revised development agreement in Detroit, we wrote off $5 million,
which was the net book value of previously incurred development costs associated with
the riverfront permanent casino site ($9 million), offset by previously accrued
obligations no longer required under the revised development agreement ($4 million).

Interest cost was higher in 2004 as we had a higher average borrowing rate due to
increases in variable interest rates and the issuance of significant fixed rate debt in the second
half of 2004 in anticipation of the Mandalay merger.

Capitalized interest increased in 2004 due to the ongoing Bellagio expansion and

KÀ

theatre projects. Capitalized interest in 2005 will include interest capitalized on
Project CityCenter. Capitalized interest decreased in 2003 due to the suspension of
development in Atlantic City in late 2002 and the mid-2003 cessation of interest
capitalization on the Company’s investment in Borgata, which opened on July 3, 2003.

Non-operating items from unconsolidated affiliates, primarily our share of
Borgata’s interest expense and state income taxes, increased from $10 million in 2003 to
$12 million in 2004. The increase is due to the full year of Borgata’s results, offset
by a reduction to state income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2004. Borgata received a
notice of refund of certain state tax credits and recorded a benefit for
amounts earned in 2003 and 2004, which had
previously been fully reserved. Our share of the adjustment was $12 million. We expect
our share of the benefit of these tax credits to positively impact this line item by
approximately $8 million per year for the next three years.

The effective income tax rate in 2004 was higher than in 2003 primarily due to the
accrual of additional state deferred taxes related to capital investments in New Jersey,
non-deductible costs related to a Michigan ballot initiative, overseas development costs
for which no tax benefit was provided, and the reversal of a greater amount of tax
reserves in 2003 compared to 2004 ($13 million in 2003 versus $6 million in 2004) as a
result of completion of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitations. The
effective income tax rate in 2003 was lower than in 2002 primarily due to the reversal
of tax reserves in 2003. Excluding the reversal, our effective income tax rate was
approximately the same in both periods.

In 2004, taxes paid increased from prior years, primarily due to increased book
income and the full utilization of tax credit carryforwards in 2003. Except for 2003,
when we made payments to settle IRS audits of prior years, taxes paid have generally
been significantly lower than our income tax provision. This is primarily due to
accelerated tax depreciation and the utilization of tax credit carryforwards. We
utilized the last of these credits in 2003, which resulted in the increase in our cash
paid for taxes in 2004.

We are evaluating the impact of provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the “Act”) that provide for a special one-time tax deduction of 85 percent on
certain repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Additional guidance from Congress
and/or the United States Treasury Department will be necessary for us to complete our
evaluation, as it is not clear at this time whether the Act will provide a benefit to
us. We will complete our evaluation as soon as practicable following the issuance of
guidance and adjust our taxes accordingly, if necessary.

We have not yet repatriated the net proceeds from the sale of MGM Grand Australia
pending our evaluation. Nonetheless, we provided in 2004 deferred U.S. income taxes of
$11 million on the basis that such proceeds would be repatriated without the benefit of
the 85 percent one-time deduction. Such amount was included in the provision for income
taxes on discontinued operations for 2004. We considered the earnings of our Australia
operations permanently reinvested prior to the sale of such operations.

If
guidance is issued that indicates our planned repatriation qualifies for the
one-time deduction, we will recognize a tax benefit of approximately $7 million as part
of continuing operations in the quarter in which such guidance is issued. If no such
guidance is issued within the applicable timeframe, then we will attempt to permanently
reinvest the proceeds in another foreign jurisdiction, such as Macau. In such case, we
would recognize a tax benefit of $11 million as part of continuing operations in the
quarter in which the reinvestment is made. We currently do not have a plan to reinvest
the proceeds in such manner.

Cash Flows – Operating Activities

Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our operating income,
excluding non-cash charges, since our business is primarily cash-based. Cash flow from
operations in 2004 increased from 2003 due to higher operating income offset by higher
tax payments. Cash flow from operations in 2003 decreased from 2002, resulting from the
decrease in operating income and higher cash paid for taxes.

At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we held cash and cash equivalents of $435 million
and $280 million, respectively. We require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts.
Beyond our cash on hand, we utilize a company-wide cash management system to minimize
the amount of cash held in banks. Funds are swept from accounts at our resorts daily
into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay
borrowings under our bank credit facilities. Included in cash and cash equivalents at
December 31, 2004 is $141 million received from the sale of MGM Grand Australia and
still held in Australia, pending clarification of the tax rule for repatriated earnings,
as discussed earlier.

Cash Flows – Investing Activities

The sale of the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries closed in January 2004 with net proceeds
to the Company of $210 million. The sale of MGM Grand Australia closed in July 2004
with net proceeds to the Company of $136 million.

Capital expenditures in 2004 increased over 2003 due to continued spending on major
projects at several of our resorts, including:

•

The Bellagio expansion completed in December 2004;

•

The theatre for

KÀ

at MGM Grand Las Vegas, completed in November 2004.

Spending on these two projects totaled approximately $325 million. Other capital
expenditures were made for maintenance capital activities, including room remodel
projects at New York-New York and MGM Grand Las Vegas and new restaurant and
entertainment amenities at several resorts. Capital expenditures
in 2003 were
significantly higher than 2002, due largely to major projects at our existing resorts,
including projects described above which began in 2003, the

Zumanity

theatre at New
York-New York, the Bellagio room remodel and slot technology improvements. Capital
expenditures in 2002 included general property improvements at our resorts, such as a
room remodel project at The Mirage, new restaurant and nightclub development at several
of our resorts, and various other remodeling projects.

Investments in unconsolidated affiliates in 2004 primarily consist of contributions
to The Residences at MGM Grand. In 2003 and 2002, such investments were primarily our
required investments in Borgata. In 2002, we also contributed $44 million to Monte
Carlo in connection with Monte Carlo’s retirement of the final $87 million of its
outstanding debt.

Cash Flows – Financing Activities

In 2004, we issued over $1.5 billion of fixed rate debt in various issuances:

•

In February and March 2004, we issued $525 million of 5.875% Senior Notes due 2014;

•

In August 2004, we issued $550 million of 6.75% Senior Notes due 2012;

•

In September 2004, we issued $450 million of 6% Senior Notes due 2009 at a premium to yield 5.65%.

In 2004, we repaid a net $1.6 billion on our bank credit facilities and repurchased
$49 million of our existing senior notes for $52 million, resulting in a loss on early
retirement of debt of $6 million (including the write-off of unamortized original issue
discount), which is classified as “Other, net” in the accompanying consolidated
statement of income. In 2003, we issued $600 million of 6% Senior Notes, due 2009 and
repaid a net $285 million on our bank credit facilities. The net proceeds of these
financing activities were used to supplement operating cash flows, fund capital
expenditures and repurchase shares of our common stock. In 2002, we utilized our
operating cash flow to reduce outstanding indebtedness by $270 million, while still
funding significant capital expenditures and share repurchases.



Our share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase programs approved by our
Board of Directors and publicly announced. Our share repurchase activity was as

proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options in the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Principal Debt Arrangements

Our long-term debt consists of publicly held senior and subordinated notes and bank
credit facilities. We pay fixed rates of interest ranging from 5.875% to 9.75% on the
senior and subordinated notes. We pay variable interest based on LIBOR on our bank
credit facility. We amended our bank credit facility in November 2003, and our current
senior credit facility is a $2.5 billion, five-year revolving credit facility with a
syndicate of banks led by Bank of America, N.A. As of December 31, 2004, we had
approximately $2.4 billion of available liquidity under our bank credit facility.
Subsequent to year-end, we redeemed three issuances of senior notes totaling $676
million of principal utilizing available funds under the bank credit facility. Our next
maturity of public debt is not due until 2006.

Other Factors Affecting Liquidity

In November 2004, in anticipation of the Mandalay merger, we entered into an
amended and restated bank credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of
America, N.A. The revised bank credit facility will be effective upon the closing of
the Mandalay merger, will mature five years later, and will provide a total of $7.0
billion of borrowing capacity, consisting of a $5.5 billion senior revolving credit
facility and $1.5 billion senior term loan facility. The remaining terms are
substantially similar to our existing bank credit facility.

Future Developments

Project CityCenter.

In November 2004, we announced a plan to develop a
multi-billion dollar urban metropolis, initially called Project CityCenter, on 66 acres
of land on the Las Vegas Strip, between Bellagio and Monte Carlo. We anticipate that
the first phase of Project CityCenter will include a 4,000-room casino resort, three
400-room boutique hotels, approximately 550,000 square feet of retail shops, dining and
entertainment venues, and 1,650 units of luxury condominium, hotel/condominium and
private residence clubs.

We expect that the complete design work for Project CityCenter will take 18 months
and that the first phase will open in 2009. The design, budget and schedule of Project
CityCenter are still preliminary however, and the ultimate timing, cost and scope of
Project CityCenter are subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects.

Atlantic City, New Jersey.

We own approximately 130 acres on Renaissance Pointe in
Atlantic City, New Jersey. In addition, Borgata occupies
29 acres at Renaissance Pointe, including 27 acres it owns and two acres we lease to
Borgata. Of the remaining land, approximately 95 acres are suitable for development,
and a portion of these acres consists of common roads, landscaping and master plan
improvements which we designed and developed as required by our agreement with Boyd.

Borgata is currently expanding its gaming and non-gaming amenities, adding 36
casino table games and 600 slot machines, along with additional restaurant,
entertainment and other amenities. This project is expected to be completed in 2006.
Additionally, Borgata has plans to add another hotel tower featuring 800 guestrooms,
suites and resort condominiums, along with a new spa, parking garage and meeting rooms.
This project is expected to be completed in 2007. Neither project is expected to
require contributions from us, as existing operating cash flow and Borgata’s recently
renegotiated bank credit facility is anticipated to provide for the cost of the expansions.



In October 2002, we announced the suspension of our development activities on our
wholly-owned project on the Renaissance Pointe land in Atlantic City. We must apply for
and receive numerous governmental permits and satisfy other conditions before
construction of a new resort on the Renaissance Pointe site could begin. No assurance
can be given that we will develop a casino resort in New Jersey, or its ultimate
schedule, size, configuration or cost if we do develop a casino resort.

Detroit, Michigan.

MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, in which we hold a controlling
interest, has operated an interim casino facility in Detroit, Michigan since July 1999.
In August 2002, the Detroit City Council approved revised development agreements with us
and two other developers. The revised development agreement released us and the City
from certain of the obligations under the original agreement and significantly changed
other provisions of the original agreement. We are currently in the process of
obtaining land and developing plans for the permanent facility. The design, budget and
schedule of the permanent facility are not finalized, and the ultimate timing, cost and
scope of the facility are subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects.

The ability to construct the permanent casino facility is currently subject to
resolution of the Lac Vieux litigation. The

th

Circuit Court of Appeals has issued an injunction prohibiting the City
and the developers from commencing construction pending further action of the

th

Circuit Court. Therefore, we do not know when we will be able to
commence construction of, or complete, the permanent facility.

United Kingdom.

In anticipation of reforms to gambling legislation currently
before the United Kingdom’s House of Parliament, we have made several strategic
agreements in the United Kingdom, including the following:

In May 2003, we purchased a 25% interest in Metro Casinos Limited, a company which
was developing a new casino in Bristol. Metro Casinos Limited is a subsidiary of R J
Bown (Holdings) Ltd, the owner of the Westcliff Casino, one of the largest United
Kingdom provincial casinos. We received regulatory approval for our investment in
Metro Casinos Limited from the Gaming Board for Great Britain in November 2003. The
Bristol facility opened in February 2004.

In October 2003, we entered into an agreement with the Earls Court and Olympia
Group, which operates large exhibition and trade show facilities in London, to form a
jointly owned company which would develop an entertainment and gaming facility, which we
would operate in space leased from the Earls Court and Olympia Group, to complement the
existing Olympia facilities. We made a deposit of £2 million ($4 million based on
exchange rates at December 31, 2004), which is refundable if proposed gaming law reforms
are not implemented by December 2005. Otherwise, the deposit will be applied to the
first year’s rent on a lease between the new company and the Earls Court and Olympia
Group. We would make a nominal equity investment and would provide a loan for half of
the estimated development costs. The agreement is subject to the implementation of
proposed gaming law reforms and a tax structure acceptable to us, and obtaining required
planning and other approvals. We own 82.5% of the entity.

In November 2003, we entered into an agreement with Newcastle United PLC to create
a 50-50 joint venture which would build a major new mixed-use development, including
casino development, on a site adjacent to Newcastle’s football stadium. Newcastle
United PLC contributed the land to the joint venture, and we made an equity investment
of £5 million ($10 million based on exchange rates at December 31, 2004), which is
refundable if certain conditions have not been met by January 2008. We would develop
and operate the complex, as well as own the casino development in leased premises within
the complex. The complex is expected to be financed through project-specific
borrowings. The agreement is subject to the implementation of proposed gaming law
reforms and a tax structure acceptable to us, and obtaining required planning and other
approvals.

In February 2004, we announced an agreement in principle with The British Land
Company PLC whereby we would operate a casino in leased premises within a newly
developed leisure and entertainment complex adjacent to the Meadowhall Shopping Centre
in Sheffield. The agreement is subject to the implementation of proposed gaming law
reforms and a tax structure acceptable to us, and obtaining required planning and other
approvals.

Macau.

In June 2004, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Pansy Ho
Chiu-king to develop, build and operate a hotel-casino resort in Macau S.A.R. The
facility, which will use the “MGM Grand” name, will be located on a prime waterfront
site and will include world-class resort amenities including a hotel, restaurants,
entertainment facilities, convention, retail and spa facilities in addition to a
significant gaming component. The agreement is subject to, among other things, the
approval of the government of Macau S.A.R. and other regulatory approvals as well as the
entry into a subconcession agreement with Sociedade de Jogos de Macau (SJM), the holder
of one of the existing concessions to operate a casino in Macau. The Company has
committed to invest up to $280 million in the entity in the form of capital
contributions and shareholder loans. The complete design, timing, cost and scope of the
project are at a preliminary stage and are subject to the risks attendant to large-scale
projects.



New York Racing Association.

We have an understanding with the New York
Racing Association (“NYRA”) to manage VLTs at NYRA’s Aqueduct horseracing facility in
metropolitan New York. We would assist in the development of the facility, including
providing project financing, and would manage the facility for a fee. Work was halted
on the VLT facility in August 2003 pending the outcome of an investigation of certain
aspects of NYRA’s operations by Federal prosecutors. In December 2003, NYRA reached
agreement with the Justice Department whereby NYRA was indicted with prosecution
deferred. NYRA agreed to pay a fine and the indictment will be dismissed with prejudice
upon NYRA implementing certain reforms and otherwise complying with the terms of the
agreement. Our participation is subject to a definitive agreement, regulatory approvals
and certain legislative changes by the State of New York.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

Our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments in
unconsolidated affiliates, which currently consist primarily of our investments in Monte
Carlo and Borgata. We have not entered into any transactions with special purpose
entities, nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward
interest rate swaps. Our joint venture and unconsolidated affiliate investments allow
us to realize the benefits of owning a full-scale resort in a manner that minimizes our
initial investment. We provided a guaranty for up to 50% of the interest and principal
payment obligations on the construction financing for The Residences at MGM Grand.
Otherwise, we have not guaranteed financing obtained by our investees, nor are there any
other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to
which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the resort.

At December 31, 2004, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $51 million, of
which $50 million support the bonds issued by the Economic Development Corporation of
the City of Detroit. These bonds are recorded as a liability in our consolidated
balance sheets. This obligation was undertaken to secure our right to develop a
permanent casino in Detroit.

Estimated interest payments on long-term debt are based on principal amounts
outstanding at December 31, 2004 after giving effect to the redemption of certain
senior notes in February 2005, and forecasted LIBOR rates for our bank credit
facility.

(2)

Includes our obligation to support $50 million of bonds issued by the Economic
Development Corporation of the City of Detroit as part of our development agreement
with the City. The bonds mature in 2009. Also includes the estimated payments of
obligations under our deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement
plans, based on balances as of December 31, 2004 and assumptions of retirement based
on plan provisions.

(3)

Our largest entertainment commitments consist of minimum contractual payments
to Cirque du Soleil, which performs shows at several of our resorts. We are
generally contractually committed for a period of 12 months based on our ability to
exercise certain termination rights; however, we expect these shows to continue for
longer periods.

(4)

The amount for 2005 includes approximately $31 million of open purchase
orders. Other commitments are for various contracts, including maintenance and
other service agreements and advertising commitments.

Other significant operating uses of cash in 2005 include tax
payments. Other significant investing uses of cash flow in 2005 include uncommitted capital
expenditures, expected to be approximately $400 million exclusive of any spending on a
permanent casino in Detroit, investments in our Macau joint venture or capital spending
at Mandalay resorts.



We plan to fund our contractual obligations and other estimated spending through a
combination of operating cash flow, proceeds from known or expected sales of businesses
and available borrowings under our senior credit facility. To fund the Mandalay
acquisition, we entered into the revised bank credit facility, which will provide the
required funds to fund payments to Mandalay’s shareholders and holders of Mandalay’s
convertible debentures, as well as refinance certain of Mandalay’s outstanding
borrowings. We are required to sell our interest in one of the two casinos in Detroit,
Michigan. The sale of either of these interests will generate significant cash flow.
We have generated over $740 million in operating cash flow in each of the past three
years, which included deductions for interest payments, tax payments and certain
contractually committed payments reflected in the above table, including operating
leases, employment agreements and entertainment agreements. We expect to generate a
higher level of operating cash flow in 2005 due to improved operating results, expanded
facilities and the Mandalay acquisition.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and
capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our
consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly
evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be
critical accounting estimates, where changes in the estimates and assumptions could have
a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors have reviewed the
disclosures included herein about our critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed
the processes to determine those estimates.

Allowance for Doubtful Casino Accounts Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at Bellagio,
MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize marker play
to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well.

We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue
collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These
collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing
with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency
notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation.
Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States. At December
31, 2004 and 2003, approximately 54% and 53%, respectively, of our casino accounts
receivable was owed by customers from the United States. Markers are not legally
enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of
foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. A
significant portion of our casino accounts receivable is owed by casino customers from
the Far East. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, approximately 25% and 30%, respectively,
of our casino accounts receivable was owed by customers from the Far East.

We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino accounts at all of our
operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense,
increases the allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the allowance for
doubtful casino accounts. At resorts where marker play is not significant, the
allowance is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged
account balances. At resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard
reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and
specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the
specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s financial
condition, collection history and any other known information. We also monitor regional
and global economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels are
adequate.

The collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of factors, including
changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home
countries. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the
allowance and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information
about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables:

The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable
has decreased since 2002, the result of improved collections leading to improved credit
statistics, reflected in the lower median age of accounts and decreasing percentage of
accounts outstanding over 180 days. Our reserve percentage is now consistent with the
percentage before the September 11 attacks, and is representative of a more normalized
collection experience and positive global economic conditions relative to the conditions
in 2001 and 2002.

At December 31, 2004, a 100 basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful
accounts as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income by $1.1
million, or $0.01 per share.

Fixed asset capitalization and depreciation policies

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs that neither
materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged
to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. We account for construction
projects in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67,
“Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects”. When we
construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to
architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and
construction subsidiary, MGM MIRAGE Design Group.

We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures.
Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a
matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether
existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of
judgment. Our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about
our assets’ estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on
our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage
of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful
life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34,
“Capitalization of Interest Cost” (“SFAS 34”), interest cost associated with major
development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project.
Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the
weighted-average cost of our outstanding borrowings, since we typically do not borrow
funds directly related to a development project. Capitalization of interest starts when
construction activities, as defined in SFAS 34, begin and ceases when construction is
substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief
period.

Whether we capitalize interest on a project depends in part on management’s
actions. In October 2002, we announced the suspension of development activities on our
wholly-owned project on the Renaissance Pointe land in Atlantic City. In connection
with that announcement, we stopped capitalizing interest associated with the project.
Interest capitalized on this project for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $41
million. In November 2004, we announced the development of Project CityCenter in Las
Vegas. In connection with this announcement and the start of design activities, we
began capitalizing interest associated with this project, including capitalizing
interest on land costs for the portion of the Project CityCenter site not currently
being utilized in operations. Interest capitalized on this project for the year ended
December 31, 2004 was $2 million.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for
the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets”. For assets to be
disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value
less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers,
or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for
impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated
future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the
asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is
indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an
impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a
discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows
include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for
assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating
expenses.



\

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of
long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the asset. To the
extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an
impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level for which
identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and
management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates
are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our
estimates.

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events
have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. We estimate
future cash flows using our internal budgets. When appropriate, we discount future cash
flows using our weighted-average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital
asset pricing model. Whenever an impairment loss is recorded, or a test for impairment
is made, we discuss the facts and circumstances with the audit committee.

See “Results of Operations” for discussion of write-downs and impairments recorded
in 2002, 2003 and 2004. In October 2002, we announced the suspension of our
development activities on our wholly-owned project on the Renaissance Pointe land in
Atlantic City. In connection therewith, we reviewed the land for potential impairment,
and determined no impairment was indicated. In December 2002, in connection with our
agreement with Turnberry Associates whereby we are required to contribute land to the
venture, we reviewed the land for potential impairment, and determined no impairment was
indicated. In June 2003, we entered into an agreement to sell the Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries. The fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value, therefore
no impairment was indicated. In February 2004, we entered into an agreement to sell MGM
Grand Australia. The fair value less costs to sell exceeds the carrying value,
therefore no impairment was indicated.

Other than the above items, we are not aware of events or circumstances that would
cause us to review any material long-lived assets for impairment.

Income taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the United States, and in several states and
foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We account for income taxes according to
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”
(“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of
applicable reserves, related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary
differences. The standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent
that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation
allowance is applied.

At December 31, 2004, we had $93 million of deferred tax assets and $1.9 billion of
deferred tax liabilities. Except for certain New Jersey state net operating losses and
certain other New Jersey state deferred tax assets, we believe that it is more likely
than not that our deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future
reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected taxable income.
The valuation allowance at December 31, 2004 related to the New Jersey deferred tax
assets was $6 million.

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) and other tax authorities. While positions taken in tax returns are sometimes
subject to uncertainty in the tax laws, we do not take such positions unless we have
“substantial authority” to do so under the Internal Revenue Code and applicable
regulations. We may take positions on our tax returns based on substantial authority
that are not ultimately accepted by the IRS.

We assess such potential unfavorable outcomes based on the criteria of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“SFAS 5”). We
establish a tax reserve if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the
unfavorable outcome can be reasonably estimated. We assess the potential outcomes of
tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis. In determining whether the probable criterion
of SFAS 5 is met, we presume that the taxing authority will focus on the exposure and we
assess the probable outcome of a particular issue based upon the relevant legal and
technical merits. We also apply our judgment regarding the potential actions by the tax
authorities and resolution through the settlement process.

We maintain required tax reserves until such time as the underlying issue is
resolved. When actual results differ from reserve estimates, we adjust the income tax
provision and our tax reserves in the period resolved. For tax years that are examined
by taxing authorities, we adjust tax reserves in the year the tax examinations are
settled. For tax years that are not examined by taxing authorities, we adjust tax
reserves in the year that the statute of limitations expires. Our estimate of the
potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental, and we believe we
have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to
uncertain tax matters.



In December 2002, we settled the IRS audit of the Company’s 1995 and 1996 tax
returns, which did not result in a material impact on our results of operations or
financial position. During 2003, we filed amended returns for tax years subsequent to
1996 to reflect the impact of the IRS audits of the 1993 through 1996 tax years on those
subsequent years. In the fourth quarter of 2003, the statutes of limitations expired
for the 1997 through 1999 tax years, resulting in a reduction of our tax reserves of $13
million and a corresponding reduction in our provision for income taxes. In the third
quarter of 2004, the statute of limitations expired for our 2000 tax return, resulting
in a reduction of our tax reserves of $6 million and a corresponding reduction in our
provision for income taxes. Subsequent to December 31, 2004, we
received notice that the IRS will audit our 2001 and 2002 tax
returns, and the tax returns for years after 2002 are subject to
possible future examination.

We classify reserves for tax uncertainties within “other accrued liabilities” in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, separate from any related income tax
payable or deferred income taxes. Reserve amounts may relate to the deductibility of an
item, as well as potential interest associated with those items.

A portion of our tax reserves was assumed in the Mirage Acquisition. The IRS audit
of the tax returns of Mirage through the merger date was settled in August 2003,
resulting in a payment to the IRS of $45 million, including interest. These matters had
been previously reserved for, so the settlement had no impact on our income tax
provision or our results of operations. Any future adjustments to the acquired Mirage
tax reserves will be recorded as an adjustment to goodwill.

Accounting Principles Adopted in 2004

Taxation on Foreign Earnings

In December 2004, the staff of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”)
issued FASB Staff Position 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign
Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP 109-2”).
FSP 109-2 allows us additional time beyond the financial reporting period in which the
Act was enacted to evaluate the effects of the Act on our plans for repatriation of
unremitted earnings. Under SFAS 109, we did not historically record a provision for
U.S. Federal or State income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries
because such earnings were considered to be indefinitely reinvested in the operations of
foreign subsidiaries. Upon the sale of MGM Grand Australia, we did provide deferred
taxes of $11 million on the basis that the proceeds would be repatriated without the
benefit of the 85 percent one-time deduction provided by the Act. The Act may allow a
special one-time deduction of 85 percent of certain repatriated foreign earnings;
however, additional clarifying language is necessary to ensure we qualify for the
deduction. The potential benefit to us of the repatriation provisions of the Act is $7
million.

Discontinued operations

In November 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the FASB reached a
consensus on Issue No. 03-13, “Applying the Conditions in Paragraph 42 of FASB Statement
No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

, in Determining
Whether to Report Discontinued Operations,” (“EITF 03-13”). EITF 03-13 requires us to
analyze whether the cash flows of a disposed component have been eliminated from our
ongoing operations and whether we retain a continuing involvement in the operations of
the disposed component. If significant migration of customers occurs to our other
operations, we would be precluded from classifying a sold or disposed operation as a
“discontinued” operation. EITF 03-13 is effective for components disposed of or
classified as held for sale in periods beginning after December 15, 2004, with optional
application to components disposed of or classified as held for sale within that fiscal
year. We did not apply EITF 03-13 to our sale of MGM Grand Australia, but if we had
applied EITF 03-13 we still would have classified MGM Grand Australia as a discontinued
operations.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

Stock-based Compensation

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”). Under the original standard, SFAS No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation “ (“SFAS 123”), companies had the option of
recording stock options issued to employees at fair value or intrinsic value, which
generally leads to no expense being recorded. Most companies, including us, opted to
use this intrinsic value method and make required disclosures of fair value expense.
SFAS 123(R) eliminates this intrinsic value alternative. SFAS 123(R) is effective for
us on July 1, 2005, at which time all future share-based payments must be recorded at
fair value. Transition methods are discussed below.

We must make certain changes in the manner of valuation of options and must make
certain decisions which will affect the amount and timing of expense recognition, as
discussed below.



Choice of valuation model.

Under SFAS 123, stock options were generally
valued using the Black-Scholes model. SFAS 123(R) does not specify which model must be
used, but requires that certain assumptions be included in the chosen model.
Essentially, we have a choice of continuing to apply the Black-Scholes model or applying
a binomial (lattice) model. The key difference is that a binomial model can better
account for sub-optimal exercises; that is, exercises before the contractual expiration
of the option. A binominal model is more complex to apply, and generally results in a
lower value than a comparable valuation using the Black-Scholes model. We have not yet
determined which model we will apply.

Choice of vesting patterns

. Under SFAS 123(R), awards with graded
vesting, as all of our awards have, may be expensed in one of two time patterns: 1) On
a straight-line basis over the complete vesting period (as though the entire award was
one grant); or 2) On an accelerated basis, treating each vesting layer as a separate
grant and amortizing each layer on a straight-line basis. For disclosure purposes under
SFAS 123, we used the accelerated basis. We have preliminarily concluded that we will
use the straight-line method for future grants under SFAS 123(R). As discussed below
under transition methods, such policy will only apply to future grants. Expense
recognized under SFAS 123(R) for previously granted options will be recorded on the
accelerated basis.

Estimating forfeitures

. Under SFAS 123, we could choose whether to
estimate forfeitures at the grant date or recognize actual forfeitures as they occur.
Under SFAS 123(R), we must estimate forfeitures as of the grant date.

Presentation of excess tax benefits in the statement of cash flows

. Under
SFAS 123(R), the excess of tax benefits realized from the exercise of employee stock
options over the tax benefit associated with the financial reporting expense is shown as
a financing cash inflow in the statement of cash flows. Previously, these excess
benefits were shown as an operating cash inflow.

Transition alternatives

. There are two allowable transition alternatives –
the modified-prospective transition or the modified-retrospective transition. Under the
modified-prospective transition, we would begin applying the valuation and other
criteria to stock options granted beginning July 1, 2005. We would begin recognizing
expense for the unvested portion of previously issued grants at the same time, based on
the valuation and attribution methods originally used to calculate the disclosures.
Under the modified-retrospective transition, we would restate prior periods to reflect
the previously calculated amounts in the pro forma disclosures as actual expenses of the
prior period (with no change in valuation or attribution methods). Future accounting
would be the same as under the modified-prospective transition. We would also restate
the statement of cash flows for the change in classification of excess tax benefits. In
addition, we would be required under the modified-retrospective transition method to
estimate forfeitures for options outstanding as of July 1, 2005 and recognize a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle to reverse such previously
recognized compensation. We have not yet determined which transition method we will
apply.

Disclosures

. There are additional disclosure requirements under SFAS
123(R), which will not have a material impact on us.

The impact of adopting SFAS 123(R) on our operating results will depend in part on
the amount of stock options or other share-based payments we grant in the future. The following table shows
compensation expense related to options granted through December 31, 2004, based on the
options’ vesting schedules:

(In thousands)

We do not believe the adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have a material impact on our
cash flows or financial position.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and
prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices.
Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long-term
debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our
long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit
facilities.

In 2003, we entered into three interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair
value hedges, which effectively converted $400 million of our fixed rate debt to
floating rate debt. In 2004, we terminated interest rate swap agreements with total
notional amounts of $400 million and entered into additional interest rate swap
agreements designated as fair value hedges with total notional amounts of $100 million,
leaving interest rate swap agreements with total notional amounts of $100 million at
December 31, 2004.



Under the terms of these agreements, we make payments based on specified spreads
over six-month LIBOR, and receive payments equal to the interest payments due on the
fixed rate debt. The interest rate swap agreements qualify for the “shortcut method”
allowed under SFAS No. 133, which allows an assumption of no ineffectiveness in the
hedging relationship. As such, there is no income statement impact from changes in the
fair value of the hedging instruments.

The following table provides information about our interest rate swaps as of
December 31, 2004:

Maturity Date

February 27, 2014

Notional Value

$100 million

Estimated Fair Value

$(81,000)

Average Pay Rate*

4.18%

Average Receive Rate

5.875%

*

Interest rates are determined in arrears.
These rates have been estimated based on implied forward
rates in the yield curve.

As of December 31, 2004, after giving effect to the interest rate swaps discussed
above, long-term fixed rate borrowings represented approximately 97% of our total
borrowings. Assuming a 100 basis-point change in LIBOR, our annual interest cost would
change by approximately $2 million.

MANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management’s Responsibilities

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
control over financial reporting for MGM MIRAGE (a Delaware corporation) and
subsidiaries (the “Company”).

Objective of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In establishing adequate internal control over financial reporting, management has
developed and maintained a system of internal control, policies and procedures designed
to provide reasonable assurance that information contained in the accompanying
consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this annual report
is reliable, does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact, and fairly presents in all material respects the financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented
in this annual report. Significant elements of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting include, for example:

•

Hiring skilled accounting personnel and training them appropriately;

•

Written accounting policies;

•

Written documentation of accounting systems and procedures;

•

Segregation of incompatible duties;

•

Internal audit function to monitor the effectiveness of the system of internal control;

•

Oversight by an independent Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

Management’s Evaluation

Management has evaluated the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
using the criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on their
evaluation as of December 31, 2004, management believes that the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting is effective in achieving the objectives described
above.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Deloitte & Touche LLP audited the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of
and for the period ended December 31, 2004 and issued their report thereon, which is
included in this annual report. Deloitte & Touche LLP has also issued an attestation
report on management’s assessment and on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting, and such report is also included in this annual
report.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM MIRAGE

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying “Management’s
Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”, that MGM MIRAGE (a Delaware
corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit
included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating
effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered
necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis
for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or
under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial
officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board
of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding
the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls,
material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the
controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in
all material respects, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated
Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,
effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on
criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and
financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 of the
Company and our report dated March 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and financial statement schedule.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM MIRAGE

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM MIRAGE (a
Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003,
and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our audits also
included the financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included
in Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are
the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our
audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such
financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the
information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 10, 2005
expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the
effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

MGM MIRAGE AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION

MGM MIRAGE (the “Company”), formerly MGM Grand, Inc., is a Delaware corporation,
incorporated on January 29, 1986. As of December 31, 2004 approximately 58% of the
outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock were owned by Tracinda Corporation, a
Nevada corporation wholly owned by Kirk Kerkorian. MGM MIRAGE acts largely as a holding
company and, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns and/or operates casino resorts.

The Company owns and operates the following casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip
in Las Vegas, Nevada: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, The Mirage, Treasure Island
(“TI”), New York-New York and the Boardwalk Hotel and Casino. The Company owns a 50%
interest in the joint venture that owns and operates the Monte Carlo Resort & Casino,
also located on the Las Vegas Strip.

The Company owns three resorts in Primm, Nevada at the California/Nevada state line
– Whiskey Pete’s, Buffalo Bill’s and the Primm Valley Resort – as well as two
championship golf courses located near the resorts. The Company also owns Shadow Creek,
an exclusive world-class golf course located approximately ten miles north of its Las
Vegas Strip resorts.

The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, MGM Grand Detroit, Inc., and its
local partners formed MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, to develop a hotel, casino and
entertainment complex in Detroit, Michigan. MGM Grand Detroit, LLC operates a casino in
an interim facility in downtown Detroit. See Note 10 for discussion of the revised
development agreement with the City of Detroit and plans for a permanent casino resort.

The Company owns and operates Beau Rivage, a beachfront resort located in Biloxi,
Mississippi. The Company also owns a 50% interest in a limited liability company that
owns Borgata, a casino resort at Renaissance Pointe, located in the Marina area of
Atlantic City, New Jersey. Boyd Gaming Corporation owns the other 50% of Borgata and
also operates the resort. Borgata opened in July 2003. The Company owns approximately
95 developable acres adjacent to Borgata, a portion of which consists of common roads,
landscaping and master plan improvements which the Company designed and developed as
required under the agreement with Boyd.

Until July 2004, the Company owned and operated MGM Grand Australia and until
January 2004, the Company owned and operated the Golden Nugget Las Vegas in downtown Las
Vegas and the Golden Nugget Laughlin in Laughlin, Nevada (the “Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries”). Until June 2003, the Company operated PLAYMGMMIRAGE.com, the
Company’s online gaming website based in the Isle of Man. See Note 3 for further information regarding these
discontinued operations. In the second quarter of 2002, the Company received proceeds of
$11 million upon termination of management agreements covering four casinos in the
Republic of South Africa. Prior to the termination, the Company managed three permanent
casinos and one interim casino and received management fees from its partner, Tsogo Sun
Gaming & Entertainment. The termination fee was recorded as part of other revenues in
the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

The Company is actively seeking future development opportunities in the United
Kingdom. In May 2003, the Company acquired a 25% interest in Metro Casinos Limited, a
United Kingdom gaming company which operates a casino in Bristol. See Note 10 for
discussion of other potential developments in the United Kingdom.

In June 2004, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement to develop, build
and operate a hotel-casino resort in Macau S.A.R. The agreement is subject to, among
other things, the approval of the government of Macau S.A.R., and other regulatory
approvals, as well as the entry into a subconcession agreement with the holder of one of
the existing concessions.



On June 16, 2004, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive
merger agreement with Mandalay Resort Group (“Mandalay”), a publicly traded company,
under which the Company will acquire Mandalay for $71.00 in cash for each share of
common stock of Mandalay. Mandalay owns and operates eleven properties in Nevada,
including Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur, Circus Circus, and Slots-A-Fun in Las Vegas,
Circus Circus-Reno in Reno, Colorado Belle and Edgewater in Laughlin, Gold Strike and
Nevada Landing in Jean, and Railroad Pass in Henderson. Mandalay also owns and operates
Gold Strike, a hotel/casino in Tunica County, Mississippi. In addition, Mandalay owns a
50% interest in Silver Legacy in Reno, a 50% interest in Monte Carlo in Las Vegas, a 50%
interest in Grand Victoria, a riverboat in Elgin, Illinois, and a 53.5% interest in
MotorCity in Detroit, Michigan. The total consideration is approximately $8.1 billion,
including equity value of approximately $4.8 billion, convertible debentures with a
redemption value of approximately $574 million, the assumption or repayment of other
outstanding Mandalay debt with a fair value of approximately $2.6 billion as of December
31, 2004, and $100 million of estimated transaction costs. The transaction is
structured as a merger of one of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiaries with and into
Mandalay. The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and is anticipated to
close during the first quarter of 2005.

NOTE 2 — SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Principles of consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates
which are 50% or less owned are accounted for under the equity method. All significant
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
Company’s operations are primarily in one segment – operation of casino resorts. Other
operations, and foreign operations, are not material.

Management’s use of estimates.

The consolidated financial statements have been
prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States of America. Those principles require the Company’s management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents include investments and
interest bearing instruments with maturities of three months or less at the date of
acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost which approximates market value.
Effective December 31, 2004, the Company is recording book overdraft balances resulting
from its cash management program as accounts payable, and has reclassified prior period
balances to conform to this presentation.

Accounts receivable and credit risk.

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of casino
accounts receivable. The Company issues markers to approved casino customers following
background checks and investigations of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2004, a
substantial portion of the Company’s receivables were due from customers residing in
foreign countries. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these
countries could affect the collectibility of such receivables.

Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically
non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when
management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously
written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is
maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their carrying amount, which
approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of
customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current economic and
business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2004, no significant
concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been
recorded.

Inventories.

Inventories consist of food and beverage, retail merchandise and
operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
primarily by the average cost method for food and beverage and supplies and the retail
inventory or specific identification methods for retail merchandise.



Property and equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Gains or
losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the determination of
income. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Property and equipment are
generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line
basis:

Buildings

40 years

Building improvements

15 to 40 years

Land improvements

15 to 40 years

Equipment, furniture, fixtures, and leasehold improvements

3 to 20 years

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment
in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived
Assets”. For assets to be disposed of, we recognize the asset to be sold
at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs of disposal. Fair value for
assets to be disposed of is estimated based on comparable asset sales, solicited offers,
or a discounted cash flow model.

For assets to be held and used, we review fixed assets for impairment whenever
indicators of impairment exist. If an indicator of impairment exists, we compare the
estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying
value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no
impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying
value, then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value,
with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still
under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs.

For a discussion of recognized impairment losses, see Note 14. In October 2002,
the Company announced the suspension of development activities on its wholly-owned
project on the Renaissance Pointe land in Atlantic City. In connection therewith, the
Company reviewed the land for potential impairment, and determined that no impairment
was indicated. In December 2002, the Company entered into an agreement with Turnberry
Associates to form a venture to construct condominium residences behind MGM Grand Las
Vegas. As part of the agreement, the Company contributed land to the venture. The
Company reviewed the land for potential impairment, and determined no impairment was
indicated.

Capitalized interest.

The interest cost associated with major development and
construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project. When no
debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended
on the project using the weighted-average cost of the Company’s outstanding borrowings.
Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or
development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

Goodwill
and other intangible assets

was assigned to Bellagio, The Mirage and TI. Other goodwill relates to the Company’s
2003 acquisition for $9 million of majority interests in the entities that operate the
nightclubs Light and Caramel, located in Bellagio, and Mist, located in TI. Changes in
the recorded balances of goodwill are as follows:

The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of development
rights in Detroit (see Note 10) and trademarks . The Company’s finite–lived
intangible assets consist primarily of lease acquisition costs, amortized over the life
of the related leases, and certain license rights with contractually limited terms,
amortized over their contractual life.

Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at
least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company
performs its annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No impairments were indicated as a result of
the annual impairment reviews for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in
2004 or 2003.

Revenue recognition and promotional allowances.

Casino revenue is the aggregate
net difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities recognized for funds
deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in
the customers’ possession (“outstanding chip liability”). Hotel, food and beverage,
entertainment and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed.
Advance deposits on rooms and advance ticket sales are recorded as accrued liabilities
until services are provided to the customer.

Revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives in accordance with the
Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) consensus on Issue 01-9, “Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller
of the Vendor’s
Products).” The consensus in EITF 01-9 requires that sales incentives be recorded as a
reduction of revenue and that points earned in point-loyalty programs, such as our
Players Club loyalty program, must be recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company
recognizes incentives related to casino play and points earned in Players Club as a
direct reduction of casino revenue.

Existing industry practice related to non-gaming revenues already complied with
EITF 01-9. The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services
furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as
promotional allowances. The estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is
primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Advertising.

The Company expenses advertising costs the first time the advertising
takes place. Advertising expense, which is generally included in general and
administrative expenses, was $57 million, $54 million and $52 million for 2004, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

Corporate expense.

Corporate expense represents unallocated payroll and aircraft
costs, professional fees and various other expenses not directly related to the
Company’s casino resort operations. In addition, corporate expense includes the costs
associated with the Company’s evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities,
which are expensed as incurred until development of a specific project has become
probable.



Preopening and start-up expenses.

The Company accounts for costs incurred during
the preopening and start-up phases of operations in accordance with Statement of
Position 98-5, “Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities”. Preopening and start-up
costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as
preopening and start-up expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and
other expenses related to new or start-up operations and new customer initiatives.

Income per share of common stock.

The weighted-average number of common and common
equivalent shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share
consisted of the following:

Stock-based compensation.

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation,
including employee stock option plans, in accordance with Accounting Principles Board
Opinion No. 25, “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees” and the Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s Interpretation No. 44, “Accounting for Certain Transactions involving
Stock Compensation, an interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25”, and discloses supplemental
information in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123,
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation” (“SFAS 123”), as amended by Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation –
Transition and Disclosure” (“SFAS 148”). The Company does not incur compensation
expense for employee stock options when the exercise price is at least 100% of the
market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. For disclosure
purposes, employee stock options are measured at fair value and compensation is assumed
to be amortized over the vesting periods of the options.

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004),
“Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123(R)”). Under the original standard, SFAS No. 123,
companies had the option of
recording stock options issued to employees at fair value or intrinsic value, which
generally leads to no expense being recorded. The Company opted to use this intrinsic
value method and make required disclosures of fair value expense.
SFAS 123(R)
eliminates this intrinsic value alternative. SFAS 123(R) is effective for the Company
on July 1, 2005, at which time all future share-based payments must be recorded at fair
value.

The Company has adopted nonqualified stock option plans and incentive stock option
plans which provide for the granting of stock options to eligible directors, officers
and employees. The plans are administered by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee
of the Board of Directors. Salaried officers, directors and other key employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries are eligible to receive options. The exercise price in
each instance is 100% of the fair market value of the Company’s common stock on the date
of grant. The options have 10-year terms and in most cases are exercisable in either
four or five equal annual installments.

As of December 31, 2004, the aggregate number of stock options available for grant
was 2.2 million. A summary of the status of the Company’s stock option plans is
presented below:

amortization of restricted stock and non-employee stock option compensation for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. For purposes of computing
the pro forma compensation, the fair value of each option grant was estimated on the
date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following
weighted-average assumptions: risk-free interest rates of 3% in 2004, 3% in 2003, and 4%
in 2002; no expected dividend yields for the years presented; expected lives of 5 years
for the years presented; and expected volatility of 42% in 2004, 42% in 2003 and 50% in
2002. The estimated weighted average fair value of options granted in 2004, 2003 and
2002 was $19.10, $10.64 and $16.32, respectively.

Currency translation.

The Company accounts for currency translation in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, “Foreign Currency Translation”.
Balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance
sheet date. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange
prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are
charged or credited to other comprehensive income (loss).

Comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income includes net income and all other
non-stockholder changes in equity, or other comprehensive income. Elements of the
Company’s other comprehensive income are reported in the accompanying consolidated
statement of stockholders’ equity, and the cumulative balance of these elements
consisted of the following:

NOTE 3 — DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In June 2003, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Golden Nugget
Subsidiaries, including substantially all of the assets and liabilities of those
resorts, for approximately $215 million, subject to certain working capital adjustments.
This transaction closed in January 2004, with net proceeds to the Company of $210
million. Also in June 2003, the Company ceased operations of PLAYMGMMIRAGE.com, its
online gaming website (“Online”). In February 2004, the Company entered into an
agreement to sell the subsidiaries that own and operate MGM Grand Australia. This
transaction closed in July 2004 with net proceeds to the Company of $136 million.

The results of the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries, Online and MGM Grand Australia are
classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of
income for all periods presented. Net revenues of discontinued operations were $45
million, $231 million and $222 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31,
2004, 2003 and 2002. Included in income from discontinued operations is an
allocation of interest expense based on the ratio of the net assets of the discontinued
operations to the total consolidated net assets and debt of the Company. Interest
allocated to discontinued operations was $2 million, $9 million and $9 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Included in discontinued
operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 is a loss on disposal of Online of $7
million relating primarily to unrecoverable costs of computer hardware and software.
Included in the tax benefit from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31,
2003 is $2 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits relating to prior year
operating losses of Online. Included in discontinued operations for the year ended
December 31, 2004 is a gain on the sale of the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries of $8 million
and a gain on sale of the MGM Grand Australia Subsidiaries of $74 million.

The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities of discontinued
operations (the Golden Nugget Subsidiaries and Online) as of December 31, 2003, included
as assets and liabilities held for sale in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet:

NOTE 6 — INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES

The Company has investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the
equity method. Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s
share of the investees’ earnings and losses, as well as capital contributions to and
distributions from these companies. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates consisted
of the following:

The Company’s investments in Monte Carlo and Borgata were recorded at their
estimated fair value at the date of the Mirage Acquisition, which value exceeded the
Company’s share of the net assets of the unconsolidated affiliates by approximately $361
million. Substantially all of this difference relates to the excess of the fair value
of land owned by the affiliates over its pre-existing carrying value. The investment
balance also includes interest capitalized on the Borgata investment, which is being
amortized over 40 years.

The Company also owns 50% of The Residences at MGM Grand, along with Turnberry
Associates. As of December 31, 2004, the Company has a negative investment balance of
$3 million, recorded as other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet, representing cumulative losses on the venture. In July 2004, the Company
contributed land to The Residences at MGM Grand for construction of the first tower.
The equity credit of $9 million is greater than the $1 million previous book value of
the land, and the $8 million gain has been deferred until the earnings process is
complete, which will occur when The Residences at MGM Grand recognizes revenue on the
sale of the first tower’s units. As discussed in Note 10, the Company has provided a
guaranty for up to 50% of the interest and principal payment obligations on the
construction financing of the first tower as well as a completion guaranty.

Total interest incurred during 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $401 million, $353 million
and $345 million, respectively, of which $23 million, $15 million and $62 million,
respectively, was capitalized.



On November 24, 2003, the Company entered into the Third Amended and Restated Loan
Agreement providing for bank financing totaling $2.5 billion from a syndicate of banks
each led by Bank of America, N.A. (collectively, the “Senior Credit Facility”). The
Senior Credit Facility, as amended in 2004, consists entirely of a senior revolving
credit facility which matures on November 24, 2008.

Interest on the Senior Credit Facility is based on the bank reference rate or
Eurodollar rate. The Company’s borrowing rate on the Senior Credit Facility was
approximately 3.3% at December 31, 2004 and 2.8% at December 31, 2003. Stand-by letters
of credit totaling $51 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2004 under the Senior
Credit Facility.

In November 2004, in anticipation of the Mandalay merger, the Company entered into
an amended and restated bank credit facility with a group of lenders led by Bank of
America, N.A. The revised bank credit facility will be effective upon the closing of
the Mandalay merger, will mature five years later, and will provide a total of $7.0
billion of borrowing capacity, consisting of a $5.5 billion senior revolving credit
facility and $1.5 billion senior term loan facility. The remaining terms are
substantially similar to the Company’s existing bank credit facility.

In 2003, the Company issued $600 million of 6% Senior Notes due 2009. In 2004, the
Company issued $525 million of 5.875% senior notes due 2014. Of this amount, $225
million of the senior notes were issued pursuant to the Company’s shelf registration
statement, which completed the available securities issuances under that registration
statement and $300 million of the senior notes were issued through a Rule 144A offering
and subsequently exchanged for registered notes with identical terms. Also in 2004,
the Company issued $550 million of 6.75% senior notes due 2012 through a Rule 144A
offering which were subsequently exchanged for registered notes with identical terms.
Also in 2004, the Company issued $450 million of 6% senior notes due 2009 through a
Rule 144A offering which were subsequently exchanged for registered notes with identical
terms. The proceeds of the above offerings were used to reduce outstanding borrowings
under the Senior Credit Facility.

In August 2003, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to
$100 million of the Company’s public debt securities. Subsequently, the Company
repurchased $25 million of its senior notes. The
Company recorded a loss of $3 million related to repurchase premiums and unamortized
debt issue costs. In 2004, the Company repurchased an additional $49 million of its
senior notes for $52 million. This resulted in a loss on early retirement of debt of $6
million, including the write-off of unamortized original issue discount, classified as
“other, net” in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. In December 2004,
the Company’s Board of Directors renewed its authorization for up to $100 million of
additional debt securities.

The Company established a commercial paper program during 2001 that provides for
the issuance, on a revolving basis, of up to $500 million of uncollateralized short-term
notes. The Company is required to maintain credit availability under its Senior Credit
Facility equal to the outstanding principal amount of commercial paper borrowings. No
commercial paper borrowings were outstanding at December 31, 2004 or 2003.

The Company attempts to limit its exposure to interest rate risk by managing the
mix of its long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under its bank
credit facilities. In 2003, the Company entered into three interest rate swap
agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which effectively converted $400 million
of the Company’s fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. In 2004, the Company terminated
interest rate swap agreements with total notional amounts of $400 million and entered
into additional interest rate swap agreements, designated as fair value hedges, with
total notional amounts of $100 million, leaving interest rate swap agreements with total
notional amounts of $100 million remaining as of December 31, 2004. At December 31,
2004, the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements was a liability of $0.1
million.

Under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements, the Company makes payments
based on specified spreads over six-month LIBOR, and receives payments equal to the
interest payments due on the fixed rate debt. The interest rate swap agreements qualify
for the “shortcut method” allowed under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
133, which allows an assumption of no ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship. As
such, there is no income statement impact from changes in the fair value of the hedging
instruments. Instead, the fair value of the instruments is recorded as an asset or
liability on the Company’s balance sheet, with an offsetting adjustment to the carrying
value of the related debt. The Company received $5 million upon termination of swap
agreements in 2004, which has been added to the carrying value of the related debt
obligations and is being amortized and recorded as a reduction of interest expense over
the remaining life of that debt.



During 2001 and 2002, the Company entered into several interest rate swap
agreements, designated as fair value hedges, which effectively converted a portion of
the Company’s fixed rate debt to floating rate debt. By the second quarter of 2002, the
Company had terminated these interest rate swap agreements. The Company received net
payments totaling $11 million during 2001 and 2002 upon the termination of these swap
agreements. These amounts have been added to the carrying value of the related debt
obligations and are being amortized and recorded as a reduction of interest expense over
the remaining life of that debt.

The Company and each of its material subsidiaries, excluding MGM Grand Detroit, LLC
and the Company’s foreign subsidiaries, are directly liable for or unconditionally
guarantee the Senior Credit Facility, senior notes, senior debentures, and senior
subordinated notes. MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is a guarantor under the Senior Credit
Facility, but only to the extent that the proceeds of borrowings under such facilities
are made available to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC. Substantially all of the Company’s
assets, other than assets of foreign subsidiaries and certain assets in use at MGM Grand
Detroit, were pledged as collateral for the Company’s senior notes, excluding
subordinated notes, and the Company’s bank credit facilities at
December 31, 2004. See Note 18 for additional information.

The Company’s long-term debt obligations contain certain customary covenants. The
Company’s Senior Credit Facility contains covenants that require the Company to maintain
certain financial ratios. At December 31, 2004, the Company was required to maintain a
maximum leverage ratio (average debt to EBITDA, as defined) of 5.5:1, which decreases
periodically to 4.75:1 by December 2007. The Company must also maintain a minimum
coverage ratio (EBITDA to interest charges, as defined) of 2.75:1. As of December 31,
2004, the Company’s leverage and interest coverage ratios were 4.0:1 and 3.7:1,
respectively.

Maturities of the Company’s long-term debt as of December 31, 2004 are as follows:

The estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt at December 31, 2004 was
approximately $5.9 billion, versus its book value of $5.5 billion. At December 31,
2003, the estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt was approximately $6.0
billion, versus its book value of $5.6 billion. The estimated fair value of the
Company’s public debt securities was based on quoted market prices on or about December
31, 2004 and 2003. The estimated fair value of the Company’s outstanding credit
facility borrowings was assumed to approximate book value due to the short-term nature
of the borrowings.

NOTE 9 — INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109
requires the recognition of deferred income tax assets, net of applicable reserves,
related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences. The
standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of
such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.

For U.S. federal income tax return purposes, the Company has a net operating loss
carryforward of $4 million, which will begin to expire in 2009. For state income tax
purposes, the Company has a New Jersey net operating loss carryforward of $122 million,
which equates to a deferred tax asset of $7 million, after federal tax effect, and
before valuation allowance. The New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards begin to
expire in 2005.



At December 31, 2004, there is a $6 million valuation allowance provided on certain
New Jersey state net operating loss carryforwards and other New Jersey state deferred
tax assets because management believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than
not” criteria for recognition under SFAS 109. Management believes all other deferred
tax assets are more likely than not to be realized because of the future reversal of
existing taxable temporary differences and expected future taxable income. Accordingly,
there are no other valuation allowances provided at December 31, 2004.

The Company is evaluating the impact of provisions of the American Jobs Creation
Act of 2004 (the “Act”) that provide for a special one-time tax deduction of 85 percent
on certain repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Additional guidance from
Congress and/or the United States Treasury Department will be necessary for the Company
to complete its evaluation, as it is not clear at this time whether the Act will provide
a benefit to the Company. The Company will complete the evaluation as promptly as
practicable following the issuance of such guidance and adjust taxes accordingly, if
necessary.

The Company has not yet repatriated the net proceeds from the sale of MGM Grand
Australia pending the evaluation. Nonetheless, the Company provided
in 2004 deferred U.S.
income taxes of $11 million on the basis that such proceeds would be repatriated without
the benefit of the 85 percent one-time deduction. Such amount was included in the
provision for income taxes on discontinued operations for 2004. The Company considered
the earnings of its Australia operations permanently reinvested prior to the sale of
such operations.

If
guidance is issued that indicates the planned repatriation qualifies for the
one-time deduction, the Company will recognize a tax benefit of approximately $7 million
as part of continuing operations in the quarter in which such guidance is issued. If no
such guidance is issued within the applicable timeframe, then the Company will attempt
to permanently reinvest the proceeds in another foreign jurisdiction, such as Macau. In
such case, the Company would recognize a tax benefit of $11 million as part of
continuing operations in the quarter in which the reinvestment is made. The Company
currently does not have a plan to reinvest the proceeds in such manner.

NOTE 10 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases.

The Company leases real estate and various equipment under operating and,
to a lesser extent, capital lease arrangements. Certain real estate leases provide for
escalation of rent based upon a specified price index and/or based upon periodic
appraisals.

At December 31, 2004, the Company was obligated under non-cancelable operating
leases and capital leases to make future minimum lease payments as follows:

2002, respectively.



Detroit Development Agreement.

Under the August 2002 revised development agreement
with the City of Detroit, MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and the Company are subject to certain
obligations. The City of Detroit required payments of $44 million, all of which had
been made as of December 31, 2004; the transfer of assets of $3 million; indemnification
of up to $20 million related to the Lac Vieux and certain other litigation, of which $2
million has been paid as of December 31, 2004; and continued letter of credit support
for $50 million of bonds issued by the Economic Development Corporation of the City of
Detroit for land purchases along the Detroit River. The letter of credit will be drawn
on to make interest and principal payments on the bonds, which mature in 2009. The
remaining obligations have been classified as other accrued liabilities or other
long-term obligations, depending on the expected payment date.

The Company recorded an intangible asset (development rights, deemed to have an
indefinite life) of approximately $115 million in connection with its obligations under
the revised development agreement. In addition to the above obligations, the Company
will pay the City of Detroit 1% of gaming revenues (2% if annual revenues exceed $400 million)
beginning January 1, 2006.

The Company is currently in the process of obtaining land and developing plans for
the permanent casino facility. The design, budget and schedule of the permanent
facility are not finalized, and the ultimate timing, cost and scope of the project are
subject to risks attendant to large-scale projects. The ability to construct the
permanent casino facility is currently subject to resolution of the Lac Vieux
litigation. The 6

th

Circuit Court of
Appeals has issued an injunction prohibiting the City and the developers from commencing
construction pending further action of the 6

th

Circuit Court. Therefore, it
is unknown when construction of the permanent facility will commence or when the
permanent facility will open.

United Kingdom.

In October 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with the
Earls Court and Olympia Group, which operates large exhibition and trade show facilities
in London, to form a jointly owned company which would develop an entertainment and
gaming facility, which the Company would operate in space leased from Earls Court and
Olympia, to complement the existing Olympia facilities. The Company made a deposit of
£2 million ($4 million based on exchange rates at December 31, 2004), which is
refundable if proposed gaming law reforms are not implemented by December 2005.
Otherwise, the deposit will be applied to the first year’s rent on a lease between the
new company and Earls Court and Olympia. The Company would make a nominal equity
investment and would provide a loan for half of the estimated development costs. The
agreement is subject to the implementation of proposed gaming law reforms and a tax
structure acceptable to the Company, and obtaining required planning and other
approvals. The Company owns 82.5% of the entity.

In November 2003, the Company entered into an agreement with Newcastle United PLC
to create a 50-50 joint venture which would build a major new mixed-use development,
including casino development, on a site adjacent to Newcastle’s football stadium.
Newcastle United PLC contributed the land to the joint venture, and the Company made an
equity investment of £5 million ($10 million based on exchange rates at December 31,
2004), which is refundable if certain conditions have not been met by January 2008. The
Company would develop and operate the complex, as well as own the casino development in
leased premises within the complex. The agreement is subject to the implementation of
proposed gaming law reforms and a tax structure acceptable to the Company, and obtaining
required planning and other approvals.

Macau.

In connection with the Company’s pending joint venture in Macau (see Note
1), the Company has committed to invest up to $280 million in the entity in the form of
capital contributions and shareholder loans.

New York Racing Association.

The Company has an understanding with the New York
Racing Association (“NYRA”) to manage video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) at NYRA’s
Aqueduct horseracing facility in metropolitan New York. The Company would assist in the
development of the facility, including providing project financing, and would manage the
facility for a fee. Work was halted
on the VLT facility in August 2003 pending the outcome of an investigation of certain
aspects of NYRA’s operations by Federal prosecutors. In December 2003, NYRA reached
agreement with the Justice Department whereby NYRA was indicted with prosecution
deferred. NYRA agreed to pay a fine and the indictment will be dismissed with prejudice
upon NYRA implementing certain reforms and otherwise complying with the terms of the
agreement. The Company’s participation is subject to a definitive agreement, regulatory
approvals and certain legislative changes by the State of New York.



The Residences at MGM Grand.

In July 2004, the venture obtained construction
financing for up to $210 million for the development of the first tower. The Company
has provided a guaranty for up to 50% of the interest and principal payment obligations
on the construction financing as well as a joint and several
completion guaranty with its partners. The Company recorded
the value of the guaranty obligation, approximately $2 million, in other long-term
liabilities.

Other Guarantees.

The Company is party to various guarantee contracts in the
normal course of business, which are generally supported by letters of credit issued by
financial institutions. The Company’s Senior Credit Facility limits the amount of
letters of credit that can be issued to $200 million, and the amount of available
borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility is reduced by any outstanding letters of
credit. At December 31, 2004, the Company had provided a $50 million letter of credit
to support the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit bonds referred to above, which are a
liability of the Company.

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which
relate to routine matters incidental to its business. Management does not believe that
the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s
financial position or results of operations.

At December 31, 2004, we had 10 million shares available for repurchase under a
July 2004 authorization.

In May 2002, the Board of Directors approved a restricted stock plan. The plan
allowed for the issuance of up to 1 million shares of Company common stock to certain
key employees. The restrictions on selling these shares lapse 50% on the third
anniversary date from the grant date and 50% on the fourth anniversary date after the
grant date. Through December 31, 2004, 903,000 shares were issued, with an aggregate
value of $32 million. This amount was recorded as deferred compensation in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet and is being amortized to operating expenses on
a straight-line basis through the period in which the restrictions fully lapse.
Amortization of deferred compensation was $7 million, $8 million and $5 million for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and 855,000 shares were
outstanding under the plan at December 31, 2004. In November 2002, the Board of
Directors determined that no more awards would be granted under the plan.

NOTE 12 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Employees of the Company who are members of various unions are covered by
union-sponsored, collectively bargained, multi-employer health and welfare and defined
benefit pension plans. The Company recorded an expense of $86 million in 2004, $77
million in 2003 and $66 million in 2002 under such plans. The plans’ sponsors have not
provided sufficient information to permit the Company to determine its share of unfunded
vested benefits, if any.

The Company is self-insured for most health care benefits for its non-union
employees. The liability for claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not
reported is included in the “Other accrued liabilities” caption in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets.

The Company has a retirement savings plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code for eligible employees not covered by a collective bargaining agreement
that does not specifically provide for participation in the plan. The plans allow
employees to defer, within prescribed limits, up to 30% of their income on a pre-tax
basis through contributions to the plans. The Company matches, within prescribed
limits, a portion of eligible employees’ contributions. In the case of certain union
employees, the Company contributes to the plan are based on hours worked. The Company
recorded charges for 401(k) contributions of $12 million in 2004, $10 million in 2003
and $12 million in 2002.



The Company maintains a nonqualified deferred retirement plan for certain key
employees. The plan allows participants to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion of their
salary and bonus and accumulate tax deferred earnings, plus investment earnings on the
deferred balances, as a retirement fund. Participants receive a Company match of up to
4% of salary, net of any Company match received under the Company’s 401(k) plan. All
employee deferrals vest immediately. The Company matching contributions vest ratably
over a three-year period. The Company recorded charges for matching contributions of
$1 million in 2004, $2 million in 2003 and $1 million in 2002.

The Company implemented a supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) for
certain key employees effective January 1, 2001. The SERP is a nonqualified plan under
which the Company makes quarterly contributions which are intended to provide a
retirement benefit that is a fixed percentage of a participant’s estimated final
five-year average annual salary, up to a maximum of 65%. Company contributions and
investment earnings on the contributions are tax-deferred and accumulate as a retirement
fund. Employees do not make contributions under this plan. A portion of the Company
contributions and investment earnings thereon vests after three years of SERP
participation and the remaining portion vests after both five years of SERP
participation and 10 years of continuous service. The Company recorded expense of $5
million under this plan in each of 2004, 2003 and 2002.

(17,021

In 2004, restructuring costs include $3 million for contract termination costs
related to the Aqua restaurant at Bellagio and $2 million of workforce reduction costs
at MGM Grand Detroit as a result of the Company’s efforts to minimize the impact of a
gaming tax increase in Michigan.

2003 restructuring costs included $2 million related to the closure of the
Siegfried & Roy show, primarily for severance costs of employees involved in the show’s
production. Also, the Company terminated a restaurant lease and closed two marketing
offices, resulting in $4 million of contract termination charges. Other severance of $1
million in 2003 related primarily to restructuring of table games staffing at several
resorts.

The Company recorded $3 million of restructuring charges in December 2002 related
to contract termination costs for a restaurant and the EFX! show at MGM Grand Las Vegas.
In December 2002, the Company recorded a restructuring credit of $10 million related to
a lease contract termination accrual originally recorded in June 2000. In December 2002
management determined that payment under this obligation was not probable. In 2001,
management responded to a decline in business volumes caused by the September 11 attacks
by implementing cost containment strategies which included a significant reduction in
payroll and a refocusing of several of the Company’s marketing programs. This resulted
in a $22 million charge against earnings. As a result of improving business levels and
the Company’s success at re-hiring a substantial number of previously laid off or
terminated employees, management determined in 2002 that a portion of the remaining
accrual would now not be necessary. This resulted in a restructuring credit of $10
million.

The following table summarizes activity for restructuring accruals with a balance
at December 31, 2004. All other restructuring awards have been fully paid or otherwise
resolved.

In 2004, there were no material unusual property transactions. In 2003 the Company
sold 315 acres of land in North Las Vegas, Nevada near Shadow Creek for approximately
$55 million, which resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $37 million. Also in
2003, the Company recorded write-downs and impairments of assets abandoned or replaced
with new construction, primarily at MGM Grand Las Vegas in preparation for new
restaurants and the new theatre. Prior to 2003, the Company classified gains and losses
on routine asset sales or disposals as a non-operating item at some resorts and as an
operating item at other resorts. Management believes the preferable presentation of
these items is as an element of operating income. Prior period statements have not been
reclassified as such transactions were not material in the prior periods. Until 2003,
demolition costs were typically capitalized as part of new construction. The Company
began expensing demolition costs on major construction projects as incurred on January
1, 2003, and is accounting for this change in policy prospectively. Demolition costs
were not material in prior periods. Demolition costs in 2004 and 2003 relate primarily
to preparation for the Bellagio standard room remodel, Bellagio expansion and new
theatre at MGM Grand Las Vegas.

In 2002, Tropical Storm Isidore caused property damage at Beau Rivage totaling $8
million, including clean-up costs. The amount of the write-down for damaged assets was
determined based on the net book value of the assets and engineering estimates. In
connection with the revised development agreement in Detroit, the Company wrote off $5
million, which was the net book value of previously incurred development costs
associated with the riverfront permanent casino site ($9 million), offset by previously
accrued obligations no longer required under the revised development agreement ($4
million). Also in 2002, the Company recorded write-downs and impairments of assets
abandoned or replaced with new construction.

affiliated with one of the Company’s directors. The Company also engaged in
transactions with its unconsolidated affiliates. In each of 2004 and 2003, the Company
paid Monte Carlo $4 million as a result of closing the tram between Bellagio and Monte
Carlo in preparation for the Bellagio expansion. The Company leases two acres of land
to Borgata and received $1 million in each of 2004, 2003 and 2002 under this lease.
Borgata is required to pay for a portion of the masterplan improvements at Renaissance
Pointe, and the Company is responsible for environmental cleanup costs incurred by
Borgata. The net amount reimbursed to the Company under these arrangements for the
years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $1 million, $10 million and $8 million,
respectively.

Results for the fourth
quarter of 2004 include a reduction of Borgata’s state tax
expense, our share of which is recorded as “non-operating items
from unconsolidated affiliates.” Borgata received a notice of
refund of certain state tax credits and recorded a benefit for
amounts earned
in 2003 and 2004. Our share of the adjustment was $12 million, or
$0.05 per share, net of tax.

Because income per share amounts are calculated using the weighted average number
of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum
of the per share amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total income per share
amounts for the year.

NOTE 18 — SUBSEQUENT EVENT

Redemption of Senior Notes

. In January 2005, the Company announced that it had
called all of its outstanding 6.875% Senior Notes due February 2008 for redemption. The
notes were redeemed at the present value of future interest payments plus accrued
interest at the date of redemption. The Company recorded a loss on retirement of debt
of $20 million in the first quarter of 2005. As a result of the redemption of the
February 2008 Senior Notes and the repayment of the $300 million 6.95% Senior Notes that
matured in February 2005, the Company applied for, and received, release of collateral
under its Senior Credit Facility and senior notes. Therefore, the Company’s Senior
Credit Facility and senior notes are now unsecured, but are still subject to guarantees
by the Company and each of its material subsidiaries, excluding MGM Grand Detroit, LLC
and the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.
