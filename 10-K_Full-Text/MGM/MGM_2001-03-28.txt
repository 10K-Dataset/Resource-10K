PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

MGM MIRAGE, formerly known as MGM Grand, Inc. (the "Company" or the "Registrant," which may also be referred to as "we," "us" or "our") was organized as
a Delaware corporation on January 29, 1986. On March 1, 1999, we completed the acquisition of Primadonna Resorts, Inc. whereby Primadonna became our wholly owned subsidiary. The
merger had a total equity value of approximately $244 million. In addition, Primadonna had outstanding debt of approximately $315 million. On May 31, 2000, we completed the
acquisition of Mirage Resorts, Incorporated whereby Mirage became our wholly owned subsidiary. The merger had a total equity value of approximately $4.4 billion. In addition, Mirage had
outstanding debt of approximately $2.0 billion.

Our Operating Properties

Through our wholly owned subsidiaries, we own and operate the following hotel-casinos and resorts:

•

Bellagio—

an elegant European-style luxury resort located on an approximately
90-acre site with 1,450 feet of frontage at the center of the Las Vegas Strip, which opened on October 15, 1998. The resort overlooks an eight-acre lake inspired by Lake
Como in Northern Italy. Each day, more than 1,000 fountains in the lake come alive at regular intervals in a choreographed ballet of water, music and lights. Bellagio features a wide variety of casual
and gourmet restaurants in both indoor and outdoor settings (including the world-famous Le Cirque, Olives, Aqua and Picasso restaurants), upscale retail boutiques (including those leased to Armani,
Chanel, Gucci, Hermes, Prada, Fred Leighton and Tiffany & Co.) and extensive meeting, convention and banquet space. Bellagio's specially designed theatre offers luxurious seating overlooking a
stage that rises and falls in sections into what we believe
to be one of the world's largest enclosed bodies of water. The theatre is home to the spectacular show

"O"

produced and performed by the talented Cirque
du Soleil organization. The Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art features rotating exhibitions of original masterpieces from museums and private collections. The surroundings of Bellagio are lushly landscaped
with classical gardens and European fountains and pools. Inside, a botanical conservatory is filled with vibrant colors and pleasing scents that change with the seasons.

•

MGM Grand Las Vegas—The City of Entertainment—

a multi-themed destination resort,
located on approximately 116 acres, with over 350 feet of frontage on the Las Vegas Strip and 1,450 feet of frontage on Tropicana Avenue. The complex is easily accessible from McCarran International
Airport and from Interstate 15 via Tropicana Avenue. MGM Grand Las Vegas features a 380,000 square foot state-of-the-art conference center, a 6.6 acre pool and spa
complex, an approximately 50 foot tall polished bronze lion sculpture on a 25 foot pedestal, which is the resort's signature, and a Studio 54 nightclub. Other amenities include "Studio Walk," which
portrays a Hollywood sound stage and reflects an appearance that is inspired by a number of Hollywood landmarks, including the Brown Derby restaurant, the Farmers Market food court and Griffith Park
Observatory retail facilities, 12 additional restaurants and 37 retail shopping outlets, including 20 owned and 17 leased facilities. Entertainment facilities include: an 11,700 square foot indoor
arcade containing carnival games of skill and an extensive video arcade including virtual reality simulators; a 746-seat showroom providing celebrity entertainment; a 387-seat
Cabaret Theatre which will house a new show beginning in May 2001; a 1,774-seat showroom specifically designed for the EFX production show, our original grand spectacle special
effects stage production; and the MGM Grand Garden, a special events center which seats a maximum of 16,766 patrons and provides a venue for mega-entertainment such as: the
spectacular millennium New Years' concert featuring Barbra Streisand; Tina Turner; Bette Midler; the Rolling Stones; Rod Stewart; Neil Diamond; Elton John;


Billy
Joel; Jimmy Buffett; Phil Collins; and Bruce Springsteen, as well as championship boxing and other sporting events.

MGM
Grand Las Vegas is currently connected to Bally's and Paris hotel-casinos via a one-mile elevated public transit monorail. The monorail was acquired in September 2000 by The Las
Vegas Monorail Company, a Nevada nonprofit corporation, which has commenced a system expansion project. When completed, the system will be approximately four miles long and will have seven stations
directly connecting eight hotel-casinos on the east side of the Las Vegas Strip to the Las Vegas Convention Center. Completion of the expanded monorail system is scheduled for the first quarter of
2004.

•

The Mirage—

a luxurious, tropically themed destination resort located on approximately 100 acres
with 2,200 feet of frontage shared with Treasure Island near the center of the Las Vegas Strip. The exterior of the resort is landscaped with palm trees, abundant foliage and more than four acres of
lagoons and other water features centered around a 54-foot volcano and waterfall. Each evening, the volcano erupts
at regular intervals, sending blasts of steam and water 40 feet into the air, with flames that spectacularly illuminate the front of the resort. Inside the front entrance is an atrium with a tropical
garden and additional water features capped by a 100-foot-high glass dome. The atrium has an advanced environmental control system and creative lighting and other special
effects designed to replicate the sights, sounds and fragrances of the South Seas. Located at the rear of the hotel, adjacent to the swimming pool area, is a dolphin habitat with eight Atlantic
bottlenose dolphins and

The Secret Garden of Siegfried & Roy

, an attraction that allows guests to view the beautiful exotic animals of
Siegfried & Roy, the world-famous illusionists who star in a spectacular show at The Mirage. In March 2000, construction of the Danny Gans Theatre in The Mirage, which showcases this
talented singer/impersonator, was completed.

•

Treasure Island at The Mirage—

a Caribbean-themed hotel-casino resort located next to The
Mirage. Treasure Island and The Mirage are connected by a monorail. The front of Treasure Island, facing the Strip, is an elaborate pirate village where full-scale replicas of a pirate
ship and a British frigate regularly engage in a pyrotechnic and special effects sea battle, culminating with the sinking of the frigate. The showroom at Treasure Island features

Mystère

, a
unique choreographic mix of magic, special effects and feats of human prowess produced and performed by Cirque du Soleil. In
recognition of its superior customer service and upgraded guestrooms, Treasure Island has been awarded the Four Diamond rating by AAA.

•

New York-New York Hotel and Casino—

a 47-story destination resort which
opened on January 3, 1997. New York-New York, which is located on the Las Vegas Strip at Tropicana Avenue, replicates many of New York City's landmark buildings and icons, including
the Statue of Liberty, the Empire State Building, Central Park, the Brooklyn Bridge and a Coney Island-style roller coaster. New York-NewYork is considered to be one of the most
architecturally distinctive buildings in the world. The casino features highly themed interiors:

Park Avenue

with retail shops,

The Financial District

consisting of the cashier's cage, a

Central Park

setting in the central casino
area, and

Little Italy

with its traditional food court set inside a typical residential neighborhood. New York-New York also features seven
specialty leased restaurants.

•

Primm Properties—

consist of three hotel-casinos on both sides of Interstate 15 at the
California/Nevada state line in Primm, Nevada (about 40 miles from Las Vegas) and the Primm Valley Golf Club nearby in California.

Buffalo
Bill's Resort & Casino, Primm Valley Resort & Casino, Whiskey Pete's Hotel & Casino and Primm Valley Golf Club (collectively, the "Primm Properties") form a major
destination location and offer, to the more than 12 million vehicles annually traveling through Primm on Interstate 15, the first opportunity to wager upon entering Nevada and the last
opportunity before leaving. We estimate that more than 26% of all passing vehicles stopped at the Primm Properties in 2000.


The Primm Properties offer an array of amenities and attractions, including a 25,000 square foot conference center, 20 restaurants, 10 of which are leased, and a variety of amusement rides. In
addition, the Primm Properties feature swimming pools, a movie theatre, motion simulation theatres, an interactive water flume ride, "The Desperado" roller coaster and the "Turbo Drop" thrill ride.
The 6,100-seat Star of the Desert Arena hosts top-name entertainers and has allowed the Primm Properties to use special events as part of extended stay packages.

In
July 1998, the Fashion Outlet of Las Vegas opened to the public. The Fashion Outlet is a highly themed shopping experience containing approximately 400,000 square feet of retail space with
over 100 retail outlet stores. The Fashion Outlet is connected to Primm Valley and is owned and operated by a partnership of TrizecHahn Factory Shops, Inc. and Talisman Companies.

•

The Golden Nugget—

the largest, in terms of number of guestrooms (according to the Las Vegas
Convention and Visitors Authority) and, we believe, the most luxurious hotel-casino in downtown Las Vegas. The Golden Nugget, together with its parking facilities, occupies approximately seven and
one-half acres and is located approximately five miles north of The Mirage. It has received the AAA Four Diamond Award for 24 consecutive years. The Golden Nugget has also benefited from
the "Fremont Street Experience," a $70 million entertainment attraction developed by a coalition of several major downtown Las Vegas hotel-casinos (including the Golden Nugget) in conjunction
with the City of Las Vegas. This attraction converted Fremont Street into a four-block-long pedestrian mall, topped with a 90-foot by 1,400-foot special
effects canopy. Within the canopy are 2.1 million computer-controlled, four-color lights and a 540,000-watt sound system.

•

The Golden Nugget-Laughlin—

located on approximately 13 acres with 600 feet of Colorado River
frontage near the center of the tourist strip in Laughlin, Nevada, 90 miles south of Las Vegas. The Golden Nugget-Laughlin features a 32,000-square foot casino, 300 hotel rooms (including
four suites), four restaurants, three bars, a nightclub, a deli, an ice cream parlor and two gift and retail shops. Other facilities at the Golden Nugget-Laughlin include a swimming pool, a parking
garage with space for approximately 1,585 vehicles and approximately four and one-half acres of surface parking for recreational vehicles. We also own and operate a 78-room
motel in Bullhead City, Arizona, across the Colorado River from the Golden Nugget-Laughlin.

•

Monte Carlo Resort & Casino—

located on approximately 46 acres with 600 feet of frontage
on the Las Vegas Strip, approximately one-half mile south of Bellagio. We own 50% of this resort in a joint venture with Mandalay Resort Group, which manages the resort. Monte Carlo has a
palatial style reminiscent of the Belle Époque, the French Victorian architecture of the late 19th century. The resort has amenities such as a brew pub featuring live entertainment, a
health spa, a beauty salon, a 1,200-seat theatre
featuring the world-renowned magician Lance Burton, a large pool area and lighted tennis courts. Monte Carlo is connected to Bellagio by a monorail.

•

Holiday Inn® Casino Boardwalk (the "Boardwalk")—

located between Bellagio and Monte
Carlo on the Las Vegas Strip. This facility includes 654 hotel rooms and 32,000 square feet of casino space. Other amenities at the Boardwalk include a coffee shop, a buffet, a snack bar, an
entertainment lounge, two bars, a gift shop, 7,300 square feet of interior meeting space, two outdoor swimming pools and 1,125 garage and surface parking spaces.

•

Golf Resorts—

We own and operate an exclusive world-class golf course known as "Shadow Creek,"
located approximately five miles north of downtown Las Vegas and approximately ten miles north of our Las Vegas Strip hotel-casinos. We also own and operate the Primm Valley Golf Club, located one
mile south of Primm in California, which includes two 18 hole championship courses. All of these golf courses were designed by renowned golf course architect Tom Fazio.

•

MGM Grand Detroit—

our interim casino facility in Detroit, Michigan opened on July 29,
1999. The facility's interior is decorated in an Art Deco motif with a retail outlet, two themed bars, a VIP


lounge
and four restaurants: the Java Coast; Grand Buffet; Venti Uno; and our signature upscale restaurant, the Brown Derby. The site is conveniently located off the Howard Street exit from the John
C. Lodge Expressway in downtown Detroit, and has parking for approximately 3,083 vehicles in two parking garages and additional on-site covered parking.

•

Beau Rivage—

a luxurious beachfront resort located on a 41-acre site with 1,400 feet
of frontage where Interstate 110 meets the Gulf Coast in Biloxi, Mississippi. Beau Rivage opened on March 16, 1999. The graceful driveway leading to Beau Rivage is lined with intricate gardens
and stately oak trees. Large trees fill the resort's skylit atrium lobby. Twelve distinctive restaurants offer a variety of dining experiences, from a café nestled in the atrium gardens
to a steak and seafood restaurant surrounded by tropical fish and coral reefs. Adjoining its lavish health spa and salon is a lushly landscaped swimming pool, café and special events
pavilion overlooking the Gulf of Mexico. Beau Rivage also offers a state-of-the-art convention center, a shopping esplanade, a 1,600-seat theatre and a
brew pub with live entertainment nightly. Adjoining the hotel is a deluxe marina capable of accommodating yachts of up to 125 feet in length.

•

MGM Grand Australia—

located on 18 acres of beachfront property in Darwin, Northern Territory,
Australia. The resort includes a public and private casino, 96 rooms, restaurants and other facilities. We
have positioned MGM Grand Australia as a multi-faceted gaming and entertainment facility for the local market and, to a lesser extent, as an exclusive destination resort for international table game
customers.

•

MGM Grand South Africa, Inc.—

manages two permanent casinos and one interim casino in two
provinces of the Republic of South Africa. We managed an interim facility in Nelspruit from October 15, 1997 to November 17, 1999, at which time a permanent casino began operations and
the interim facility was closed. The interim casino in Witbank began operations on March 10, 1998, and the interim casino in Johannesburg operated from September 28, 1998 through
November 26, 2000, at which time the permanent facility, the Montecasino, began operations and the interim facility was closed. On July 30, 1996, we entered into an agreement with Tsogo
Sun Holdings (Pty) Limited, a joint venture company formed by the Southern Sun Group and Tsogo Investment Holding Company (Pty) Limited, to act as the exclusive casino project developer and manager
for the joint venture company, which contemplated applying for up to 15 casino licenses in the Republic of South Africa. Under the agreement, we will earn fees for the management of all casino
operations of Tsogo Sun. Tsogo Sun will provide or procure all of the financing necessary for the hotel-casino projects. Tsogo Sun has been granted additional licenses for Durban and East London, and
we anticipate interim casinos will be opened in those locations in 2001.

Future Expansion

Detroit, Michigan

The Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act provides that not more than three casinos may be licensed at any one time by the State of Michigan and that they be
located only in the City of Detroit. In November 1997, at the conclusion of a competitive selection process, the Mayor of Detroit designated MGM Grand Detroit, LLC to develop one of the three
authorized hotel-casino complexes. MGM Grand Detroit, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, holds a controlling interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and plans to provide substantially all of the
equity capital for construction of the permanent facility. A minority interest in MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is held by Partners Detroit, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company owned by residents and
entities located in the Detroit metropolitan area. As planned, the Detroit permanent facility is expected to include a 100,000 square foot casino and an 800-room hotel with ballroom,
convention and meeting rooms, restaurants, bars, entertainment and retail facilities. The total project cost could exceed $800 million and development could take up to four years. Development
of the permanent facility will not proceed until after acquisition by MGM Grand Detroit, LLC of the permanent development site from the City of Detroit, which is attempting to acquire the site from a
number of independent land owners. The design, budget and schedule for development of the permanent facility are at a preliminary stage, will be subject to the risks attendant to large-scale projects
and may be subject to additional costs and delays beyond preliminary estimates. No assurance can be given that we will develop a permanent hotel-casino in Detroit, or if we do, as to its ultimate
size, configuration or cost.

Atlantic City, New Jersey

In January 1998, the City of Atlantic City deeded to Mirage approximately 180 acres (120 acres of which are developable) in the Marina area of Atlantic
City. In exchange, Mirage agreed to develop a hotel-casino on the site and perform certain other obligations. Mirage also entered into an agreement with two New Jersey State agencies for the
construction and joint funding of road improvements necessary to improve access to the Marina area. As called for by the agreement, in October 1997, Mirage funded its $110 million
portion and one of the State agencies funded its $125 million portion of the $330 million estimated total cost of the road improvements. Each party deposited its funds into escrow
accounts and
the funds are restricted for construction of the road improvement projects. The other State agency provided the remaining $95 million estimated cost of the project. There is a fixed-price
design/build contract for the road improvement project. Groundbreaking on the project took place in November 1998, and the project is scheduled to open to the public in July 2001.

In
November 2000, a limited liability company owned 50-50 with Boyd Gaming Corporation began construction of the Borgata, a 2,000-guestroom hotel-casino
resort, on a 27-acre portion of the Marina site. Boyd is overseeing the construction and will operate the resort upon completion. Construction is expected to be completed in the summer of
2003 at a total project cost, including land, of approximately $1.0 billion. In December 2000, we contributed the 27 acres of land and Boyd contributed $90 million in cash to the
venture, and the venture obtained a $630 million secured bank credit facility, which is non-recourse to MGM MIRAGE, to fund the project costs. We and Boyd are each required to
contribute up to an additional $117 million in cash to the venture and Boyd is required to contribute any additional cash necessary to fund project costs in excess of the agreed project budget.
As of December 31, 2000, each partner had made $17 million of such additional cash contributions to the venture.

As
required by our agreement with Boyd, we have designed and are developing the common roads, landscaping and other master plan improvements for the entire Marina site. As part of the
agreement with the City, we are required to remediate environmental contamination at the Marina site, which was a


municipal landfill for many years. A substantial portion of the remediation work has been completed. We have recently decided to proceed with the design and development of a new wholly owned hotel-
casino resort on the Marina site next to the Borgata. The project is in the preliminary design phase and we have not yet developed a construction budget or schedule.

We
must apply for and receive numerous governmental permits and satisfy other conditions before construction of a new resort on the Marina site can begin. We cannot be certain of the
ultimate construction schedule or cost of construction of the Borgata or any other project on the Marina site.

Las Vegas Development

Mirage acquired the Boardwalk and various related properties on June 30, 1998. Combined with land we own adjacent to the Boardwalk, the acquisition
provides us with an approximately 55-acre site for future development with over 1,200 feet of frontage on the Las Vegas Strip between Bellagio and
Monte Carlo. The design, timing and cost of any future development on the site will depend on several factors, including the market's ability to absorb new hotel-casino resorts on the Las Vegas Strip,
competition from gaming outside of Nevada and the ultimate size and scope of the project, among other factors.

Other

We regularly evaluate possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in both the domestic and international markets. These opportunities may include the
ownership, management and operation of gaming and other entertainment facilities in Nevada or in states other than Nevada or outside of the United States. We may undertake these opportunities either
alone or with joint venture partners. Development and operation of any gaming facility in a new jurisdiction is subject to many contingencies. Several of these contingencies are outside of our control
and may include the passage of appropriate gaming legislation, the issuance of necessary permits, licenses and approvals, the availability of appropriate financing and the satisfaction of other
conditions. We cannot be sure that we will decide or be able to proceed with any of these acquisition or expansion opportunities.

Marketing

All of our hotels and casinos operate 24 hours each day, every day of the year. We do not consider our business to be particularly seasonal. We believe
that the largest portion of our Nevada customers live in Southern California, although other geographic areas are also important.

The
level of gaming activity at our casinos is the single largest factor in determining our revenues and operating profit. We also receive a large amount of revenues from room, food
and beverage, entertainment and retail operations.

The
principal segments of the Nevada and Mississippi gaming markets are tour and travel, leisure travel, high-level wagerers and conventions (including small meetings and
corporate incentive programs). Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage each appeals to the upper end of each market segment, balancing their business by using the convention and tour and travel
segments to fill the mid-week and off-peak periods. Our marketing strategy for Treasure Island, New York-New York and the Golden Nugget is aimed at attracting
middle- to upper-middle-income wagerers, largely from the leisure travel and, to a lesser extent, the tour and travel segments. Since we believe that the number of walk-in customers also
affects the success of all of our hotel-casinos, we design our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other hotels.

The
Primm Properties and Golden Nugget-Laughlin appeal primarily to middle-income customers. Their customers are attracted by room, food and beverage and entertainment prices that are
lower than those offered by the major Las Vegas hotel-casinos.


We own and operate an exclusive world-class golf course known as "Shadow Creek," located approximately five miles north of the Golden Nugget and approximately 10 miles north of our
Las Vegas Strip hotel-casinos. Our major Las Vegas hotel-casinos offer luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at Shadow Creek. In connection with our marketing activities, we also invite
our high-end casino customers to play Shadow Creek on a complimentary basis. We also own and operate the Primm Valley Golf Club, located one mile south of Primm, which includes two 18 hole
championship courses used for marketing purposes by our Las Vegas and Primm resorts.

We
believe Beau Rivage is the most luxurious hotel-casino on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Beau Rivage seeks to attract the most affluent customers in each market segment, particularly
those who live in major cities in the South, as well as customers residing in the Gulf Coast region.

MGM
Grand Detroit markets primarily to customers within a 150-mile radius of Detroit. Its customers are attracted by its diverse gaming, dining and retail offerings, its
convenient location and its ample onsite parking facilities.

MGM
Grand Australia has targeted its local Northern Territory market for its primary customer base.

We
advertise on radio, television and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States, as well as on the Internet and by direct mail. We
also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major United States and foreign cities.

Credit

Credit play represents a large portion of the table games volume at Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize credit
play to the same extent, although we
offer credit at those casinos as well, with the exception of MGM Grand Australia, where Northern Territory legislation prohibits credit play.

We
maintain strict controls over the issuance of credit and aggressively pursue collection of our customer debts. These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large
corporations, including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal and other contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Nevada, Mississippi and Michigan
gaming debts evidenced by written credit instruments are enforceable under the laws of those states. All other states are required to enforce a judgment on a gaming debt entered in Nevada, Mississippi
or Michigan pursuant to the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution. Gaming debts are not legally enforceable in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign
debtors may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. A significant portion of our Company's accounts receivable is owed by major casino customers from the Far East. The
collectibility of customer debts is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers' home countries.

Supervision of Gaming Activities

In connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our casinos, we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all receipts and disbursements.
These audit and cash controls include:

•

Locked
cash boxes on the casino floor;

•

Employees
who are independent of casino operations to perform the daily cash and coin counts;

•

Constant
observation and supervision of the gaming area;

•

Observation
and recording of gaming and other areas by closed-circuit television;

•

Constant
computer monitoring of our slot machines;

•

Computer
tabulation of receipts and disbursements for each of our table games; and

•

Timely
analysis of deviations from expected performance.


Competition

Las Vegas

Our Las Vegas hotel-casinos compete with a large number of other hotel-casinos in the Las Vegas area. Currently there are approximately 33 major hotel-casinos
located on or near the Las Vegas Strip, 11 major hotel-casinos located in the downtown area (about five miles from the center of the Strip) and several major facilities located elsewhere in the Las
Vegas area. As of December 31, 2000, there were approximately 124,000 guestrooms in Las Vegas, representing a 3% increase when compared to 120,000 at December 31, 1999. Las Vegas
Convention and Visitors Authority statistics show that visitor volume increased to 35.8 million in 2000, a 6% increase from the 33.8 million reported for 1999. Additional major new
hotel-casinos and expansion projects at existing Las Vegas hotel-casinos have been proposed. We are unable to determine to what extent increased competition will affect our future operating results.

Primm, Nevada

The Primm Properties compete primarily with two hotel-casinos located 11 miles north along Interstate 15 in Jean, Nevada and with numerous other hotels and
casinos in the Las Vegas area, as well as Native American gaming facilities in Southern California. Recent increases in room capacity on the Las Vegas Strip may increase competition for customers at
the Primm Properties. Since many of our current customers stop at Primm as they are driving on Interstate 15 to and from major casino-hotels located in Las Vegas, we believe that our success at Primm
is also favorably influenced by the popularity of the Las Vegas resorts. To a lesser extent, the Primm Properties also compete with gaming establishments in or near Laughlin, Nevada, approximately 90
miles away in Southern Nevada. The addition of major gaming properties, the substantial expansion of existing Laughlin resorts or the addition of Native American gaming facilities in California could
have an adverse effect on the number of customers visiting the Primm Properties.

Laughlin, Nevada

The Golden Nugget-Laughlin competes with nine other casinos in Laughlin, eight of which offer hotel accommodations, as well as with hotel-casinos in Las Vegas,
Jean and Primm, Nevada. In recent years, the Laughlin market has been adversely affected by the expansion of casino gaming in Las Vegas and on Native American reservations, particularly in Southern
California and Arizona, and we expect these difficult market conditions to continue.

Detroit

An assessment prepared by independent consultants for the Company concludes that the Detroit, Michigan and Windsor, Ontario casino gaming markets are
effectively one market, and that aggregate annual revenues of approximately $1.1 billion will be generated by patrons living within 150 miles of downtown Detroit. MGM Grand Detroit competes in
this market with two other interim casinos located in Detroit, as well as a government-owned casino located nearby in Windsor.

Biloxi, Mississippi

Beau Rivage competes with 11 other casinos in the Mississippi Gulf Coast market, nine of which offer hotel accommodations. Gulf Coast casinos also compete in
the regional market with a land-based casino in New Orleans and a land-based Native American hotel-casino in central Mississippi. Casinos in the Gulf Coast also compete for the
south Florida market with casinos in the Bahamas. Gulf Coast casinos compete to a lesser extent with a number of riverboat casinos in Mississippi and Louisiana.


Australia

The success of MGM Grand Australia depends in part upon a balance of (i) its ability to effectively serve the local community as well as (ii) its
ability to make efficient use of its strategic proximity to the Southeast Asian gaming market. The Darwin International Airport is an average of 5.5 hours away from the major Asian cities.
However, frequency of scheduled air service is a limiting factor.

There
are 13 casinos in Australia competing for the Far East market. Australian casinos operate under exclusive arrangements, which create a regional monopoly for a fixed term. As
such, Australian casinos do not compete among themselves for the regional middle to low-end players. However, Far East premium players have become an increasingly important source of
revenues; consequently, this market has become very competitive. Due to the competition for premium play customers, and the limitations on scheduled air service, MGM Grand Australia has targeted the
local market for its customer base, which has produced relatively stable results.

Other

Our Company's facilities also compete for gaming customers with hotel-casino operations located in other areas of Nevada, Atlantic City, the Bahamas and other
parts of the world, and for vacationers with non-gaming tourist destinations such as Hawaii and Florida. Our hotel-casinos compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries,
off-track wagering, card parlors, riverboat and Native American gaming facilities and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States. In recent years, certain states have legalized,
and several other states have considered legalizing, casino gaming. We do not believe that legalization of casino gaming in those jurisdictions would have a material adverse impact on our operations.
However, we do believe that the legalization of large-scale land-based casino gaming in or near certain major metropolitan areas, particularly in California, could have a material adverse
effect on the Las Vegas market. On March 7, 2000, voters in California approved an amendment to the California constitution that gave Native American tribes in California the right to offer a
limited number of slot machines and a range of house-banked card games. A number of tribes have already signed, and others are negotiating, gaming compacts with the State of California. More than 60
compacts had been approved by the federal government as of December 31, 2000, and casino-style gaming is legal in California on those tribal lands. At this time, we cannot determine the impact
this will have on our Nevada casinos.

How We Compete

Our major properties compete on the basis of:

•

Recruiting,
training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior and friendly customer service;

•

Offering
high-quality guestrooms and dining, entertainment and retail options;

•

Providing
unique, "must-see" entertainment attractions;

•

Our
marketing and promotional programs; and

•

The
superior locations and sites of our properties.


The principal negative factors relating to our competitive position are:

•

Our
limited geographic diversification (our major properties are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip and some of our largest competitors operate in more
gaming markets than we do);

•

There
are a number of gaming facilities located closer to where our customers live than our resorts;

•

Our
guestroom, dining and entertainment prices are often higher than those of most of our competitors in each market, although we believe that the quality
of our facilities and services is also higher; and

•

Our
hotel-casinos compete to some extent with each other for customers. Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage, in particular, compete for some of
the same high-end customers.

Employees and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2000, we had approximately 39,000 full-time and 6,000 part-time employees. At that date, we had collective
bargaining contracts with unions covering approximately 17,000 of our employees. We do not have union contracts at Beau Rivage, Golden Nugget-Laughlin or the Boardwalk. Although union organizing
activities have recently intensified in Las Vegas, we consider our employee relations to be very good.

Regulation and Licensing

Nevada Government Regulation

The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in Clark County, Nevada are subject to: (i) the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations
promulgated thereunder (collectively, the "Nevada Act"); and (ii) various local regulations. The Company's gaming operations are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Nevada
Gaming Commission (the "Nevada Commission"), the Nevada State Gaming Control Board (the "Nevada Board"), the City of Las Vegas and the Clark County Liquor and Gaming Licensing Board (the "CCLGLB").
The Nevada Commission, the Nevada Board, the City of Las Vegas and the CCLGLB are collectively referred to as the "Nevada Gaming Authorities."

The
laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada Gaming Authorities are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things:
(i) the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; (ii) the establishment and maintenance of
responsible accounting practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenues; (iii) providing
reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Nevada Gaming Authorities; (iv) the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; and (v) providing a
source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees. Any change in such laws, regulations and procedures could have an adverse effect on the Company's gaming operations.

MGM
Grand Hotel, LLC, dba MGM Grand Las Vegas, New York-New York Hotel & Casino, LLC, dba New York-New York Hotel & Casino, The Primadonna
Company, LLC, dba Primm Valley Resort, Buffalo Bill's and Whiskey Pete's, THE MIRAGE CASINO-HOTEL, dba The Mirage, Bellagio, LLC, dba Bellagio, Treasure Island Corp., dba Treasure Island at The
Mirage, GNLV, Corp., dba the Golden Nugget, GNL, Corp., dba the Golden Nugget-Laughlin, Boardwalk Casino, Inc., dba Holiday Inn® Casino Boardwalk, and Victoria Partners, dba Monte
Carlo Resort & Casino (collectively referred to as the "Casino Licensees"), operate casinos and are required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Each gaming license requires the
periodic payment of fees and taxes and is not transferable. MGM Grand Las Vegas, New York-New York, The Primadonna Company, LLC and Golden Nugget Manufacturing Corp. are also licensed as
manufacturers and distributors of gaming devices and the Boardwalk is licensed as a distributor of gaming devices. The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are also licensed as


shareholders, members and/or managers of certain corporate and limited liability company Casino Licensees. The Company's subsidiary MRGS Corp. is licensed as a 50% general partner of Victoria
Partners, the joint venture with Mandalay Resort Group that owns and operates Monte Carlo. The Company and Mirage are also each required to be registered by the Nevada Commission as a publicly traded
corporation ("Registered Corporation") and as such, each is required periodically to submit
detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission and furnish any other information that the Nevada Commission may require. No person may become a stockholder or member of, or receive
any percentage of profits from, the Casino Licensees, Golden Nugget Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Nevada Gaming Authorities. The Company,
Mirage and the foregoing subsidiaries have obtained from the Nevada Gaming Authorities the various registrations, approvals, permits and licenses required in order to engage in gaming activities in
Nevada.

The
Nevada Gaming Authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to, or material involvement with, the Company, Mirage, the Casino Licensees, Golden Nugget
Manufacturing Corp. or MRGS Corp., to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a gaming licensee. Officers, directors and certain key employees of
the foregoing subsidiaries must file applications with the Nevada Gaming Authorities and may be required to be licensed by the Nevada Gaming Authorities. Certain officers, directors and key employees
of the Company and Mirage who are actively and directly involved in the gaming activities of the foregoing subsidiaries may be required to be licensed or found suitable by the Nevada Gaming
Authorities. The Nevada Gaming Authorities may deny an application for licensing or a finding of suitability for any cause they deem reasonable. A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing,
and both require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant for licensing or a finding of suitability, or the gaming licensee by
which the applicant is employed or for whom the applicant serves, must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to the Nevada Gaming Authorities, and in
addition to their authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability or licensure, the Nevada Gaming Authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.

If
the Nevada Gaming Authorities were to find an officer, director or key employee unsuitable for licensing or to continue having a relationship with the Company, Mirage, the Casino
Licensees, Golden Nugget Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., such company or companies would have to sever all relationships with such person. In addition, the Nevada Commission may require the
Company, Mirage or the foregoing subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. Determinations of suitability or of questions pertaining to
licensing are not subject to judicial review in Nevada.

The
Company, Mirage, the Casino Licensees, Golden Nugget Manufacturing Corp., and MRGS Corp. are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports to the Nevada Commission.
Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by the Company, Mirage and the foregoing subsidiaries must be reported to or approved by the Nevada
Commission.

If
it were determined that the Nevada Act was violated by the Casino Licensees, Golden Nugget Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., the gaming licenses they hold could be limited,
conditioned,
suspended or revoked, subject to compliance with certain statutory and regulatory procedures. In addition, the Company, Mirage, the foregoing subsidiaries and the persons involved could be subject to
substantial fines for each separate violation of the Nevada Act at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Further, a supervisor could be appointed by the Nevada Commission to operate the Company's
gaming properties and, under certain circumstances, earnings generated during the supervisor's appointment (except for the reasonable rental value of the Company's gaming properties) could be
forfeited to the State of Nevada. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of any gaming license or the appointment of a supervisor could (and revocation of any gaming license would) materially
adversely affect the Company's gaming operations.


Any beneficial holder of the Company's voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application, be investigated, and have his or her
suitability as a beneficial holder of the Company's voting securities determined if the Nevada Commission has reason to believe that such ownership would otherwise be inconsistent with the declared
policies of the State of Nevada. The applicant must pay all costs of investigation incurred by the Nevada Gaming Authorities in conducting any such investigation.

The
Nevada Act requires any person who acquires more than 5% of any class of the Company's voting securities to report the acquisition to the Nevada Commission. The Nevada Act
requires that beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of the Company's voting securities apply to the Nevada Commission for a finding of suitability within thirty days after the Chairman of
the Nevada Board mails the written notice requiring such filing. Under certain circumstances, an "institutional investor" as defined in the Nevada Act, which acquires more than 10% but not more than
15% of any class of the Company's voting securities, may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for
investment purposes only. An institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course
of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company, any change in
the corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations of the Company or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action that the Nevada Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding
the Company's voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes only include: (i) voting
on all matters voted on by stockholders; (ii) making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a
change in its management, policies or operations; and (iii) such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. If the beneficial holder
of voting securities who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list of beneficial owners. The applicant
is required to pay all costs of investigation.

Under
a new provision of the Nevada Act and under certain circumstances, an "institutional investor," as defined in the Nevada Act, which intends to acquire not more than 15% of any
class of nonvoting securities of a privately held corporation, limited partnership or limited liability company that is also a registered holding or intermediary company or the holder of a gaming
license, may apply to the Nevada Commission for a waiver of the usual prior licensing or finding of suitability requirement if such institutional investor holds such nonvoting securities for
investment purposes only. An institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold nonvoting securities for investment purposes unless the nonvoting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary
course of business as an institutional investor, do not give the institutional investor management authority, and do not, directly or indirectly, allow the institutional investor to vote for the
election or appointment of members of the board of directors, a general partner or manager, cause any change in the articles of organization, operating agreement, other organic document, management,
policies or operations, or cause any other action that the Nevada Commission finds to be inconsistent with holding nonvoting securities for investment purposes only. Activities that are not deemed to
be inconsistent with holding nonvoting securities for investment purposes only include: (i) nominating any candidate for election or appointment to the entity's board of directors or equivalent
in connection with a debt restructuring; (ii) making financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a
change in the entity's management, policies or operations; and (iii) such other activities as the Nevada Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent. If the beneficial
holder of nonvoting securities who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list of beneficial owners. The
applicant is required to pay all costs of investigation.


Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Nevada Commission or the Chairman of the
Nevada Board may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any stockholder found unsuitable and who
holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of the common stock of a Registered Corporation beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the Nevada Commission may be guilty of a
criminal offense. The Company is subject to disciplinary action if, after it receives notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder or to have any other relationship with the Company, Mirage,
the Casino Licensees, Golden Nugget Manufacturing Corp., or MRGS Corp., the Company, Mirage or the foregoing subsidiaries (i) pays that person any dividend or interest upon voting securities of
the Company, (ii) allows that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person, (iii) pays remuneration in any form to that
person for services rendered or otherwise, or (iv) fails to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities for cash at fair market value.
Additionally, the CCLGLB has taken the position that it has the authority to approve all persons owning or controlling the stock of any corporation controlling a gaming licensee.

The
Nevada Commission may, in its discretion, require the holder of any debt security of a Registered Corporation to file an application, be investigated and be found suitable to own
the debt security of a Registered Corporation. If the Nevada Commission determines that a person is unsuitable to own such
security, then pursuant to the Nevada Act, the Registered Corporation can be sanctioned, including the loss of its approvals, if without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission, it:
(i) pays to the unsuitable person any dividend, interest, or any distribution whatsoever; (ii) recognizes any voting right by such unsuitable person in connection with such securities;
(iii) pays the unsuitable person remuneration in any form; or (iv) makes any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation, or
similar transaction.

The
Company is required to maintain a current stock ledger in Nevada that may be examined by the Nevada Gaming Authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent
or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to the Nevada Gaming Authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the
record holder unsuitable. The Company is also required to render maximum assistance in determining the identity of the beneficial owner. The Nevada Commission has the power to require the Company's
and Mirage's stock certificates to bear a legend indicating that such securities are subject to the Nevada Act. However, to date, the Nevada Commission has not imposed such a requirement on either the
Company or Mirage.

Neither
the Company nor Mirage may make a public offering of any securities without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission if the securities or the proceeds therefrom are
intended to be used to construct, acquire or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for such purposes. Such approval, if given, does not constitute a finding,
recommendation or approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada Board as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investment merits of the securities. Any representation to the contrary
is unlawful.

On
September 28, 2000, the Nevada Commission granted the Company and Mirage prior approval to make public offerings for a period of 10 months, subject to certain
conditions (the "Shelf Approval"). However, the Shelf Approval may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Chairman of the Nevada
Board. The Shelf Approval does not constitute a finding, recommendation or approval by the Nevada Commission or the Nevada Board as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investment
merits of the securities offered. Any representation to the contrary is unlawful.

Changes
in control of the Company or Mirage through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or any act or conduct by a person whereby
he or she obtains control, may not occur without the prior approval of the Nevada Commission. Entities seeking to


acquire control of a Registered Corporation must satisfy the Nevada Board and the Nevada Commission concerning a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control of such Registered
Corporation. The Nevada Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire
control to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process of the transaction.

The
Nevada legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and corporate defensive tactics affecting Nevada gaming
licensees, and Registered Corporations that are affiliated with those operations, may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The Nevada Commission has established a regulatory scheme
to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Nevada's gaming industry and to further Nevada's policy to: (i) assure the financial stability of corporate gaming
operators and their affiliates; (ii) preserve the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and (iii) promote a neutral environmental for the orderly governance of
corporate affairs. Approvals are, in certain circumstances, required from the Nevada Commission before the Company can make exceptional repurchases of voting securities above the current market price
thereof and before a corporate acquisition opposed by management can be consummated.

The
Nevada Act also requires prior approval of a plan of recapitalization proposed by a Registered Corporation's board of directors in response to a tender offer made directly to the
Registered Corporation's stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of the Registered Corporation.

License
fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming or activity involved, are payable to the State of Nevada, the City of Las Vegas and to Clark County.
Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly or annually and are based upon either: (i) a percentage of the gross revenues
received; (ii) the number of gaming devices operated; or (iii) the number of table games operated. A casino entertainment tax is also paid by the Casino Licensees where certain
entertainment is provided in a cabaret, nightclub, cocktail lounge or casino showroom in connection with the serving or selling of food, refreshments or merchandise. Nevada licensees that hold a
license as a manufacturer or a distributor, such as MGM Grand Las Vegas, New York-New York, The Primadonna Company, LLC, the Boardwalk and Golden Nugget Manufacturing Corp., also pay
certain fees and taxes to the State of Nevada.

Any
person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered, or is under common control with such persons (collectively, "Licensees"), and who proposes
to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay the expenses of
investigation by the Nevada Board of their participation in such foreign gaming. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Commission. Thereafter, Licensees
are also required to comply with certain reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Act. Licensees are also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Commission if they knowingly violate any laws
of the foreign
jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation, fail to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations,
engage in activities that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees, or employ a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or a finding of
suitability in Nevada on the ground of personal unsuitability.

The
sale of alcoholic beverages by the Casino Licensees is subject to licensing, control and regulation by the applicable local authorities. All licenses are revocable and are not
transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any such license, and any such disciplinary action could (and revocation would) have a material adverse
effect upon the Company's operations.

Pursuant
to a 1985 agreement between the State of Nevada and the United States Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury"), the Nevada Commission and the Nevada Board have authority,
under Regulation 6A of the Nevada Act, to enforce their own cash transaction reporting laws applicable to


casinos which substantially parallel the federal Bank Secrecy Act. Under the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 which was passed by Congress, the Secretary of the Treasury retained the ability
to permit states, including Nevada, to continue to enforce their own cash transaction reporting laws applicable to casinos. The Nevada Act requires gaming licensees to file reports related to cash
purchases of chips, cash wagers, cash deposits or cash payment of gaming debts, if any such transactions aggregate more than $10,000 in a 24-hour period. Casinos are required to monitor
receipts and disbursements of currency in excess of $10,000 and report them to the Nevada Board, which in turn reports them to the Treasury. Pursuant to amendments to the Nevada Act that became
effective on October 1, 1997, casinos are also required to file suspicious activity reports directly with an office of the Treasury and provide copies thereof to the Nevada Board. Although it
is not possible to quantify the full impact of these requirements on the Company's business, the changes are believed to have had some adverse effect on results of operations since inception.

Michigan Government Regulation and Taxation

The Michigan Gaming Control and Revenue Act subjects the ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities to extensive state licensing and regulatory
requirements. The Michigan Act also authorizes local regulation of casino gaming facilities by the City of Detroit, provided that any such local ordinances regulating casino gaming are consistent with
the Michigan Act and rules promulgated to implement it.

The
Michigan Act creates the Michigan Gaming Control Board and authorizes it to grant casino licenses to not more than three applicants who have entered into development agreements
with the City of Detroit. The Michigan Board is granted extensive authority to conduct background investigations and determine the suitability of casino license applicants, affiliated companies,
officers, directors, or managerial employees of applicants and affiliated companies and persons or entities holding a one percent or greater direct or indirect interest in an applicant or affiliated
company. Institutional investors holding less than certain specified amounts of debt or equity securities are exempted from meeting the suitability requirements of the Michigan Act, provided such
securities are issued by a publicly traded corporation, such as MGM MIRAGE, and the securities were purchased for investment purposes only and not for the purpose of influencing or affecting the
affairs of the issuer.

The
Michigan Act imposes the burden of proof on the applicant for a casino license to establish its suitability to receive and hold the license. The applicant must establish its
suitability as to integrity, moral character and reputation, business probity, financial ability and experience, responsibility, and other criteria deemed appropriate by the Michigan Board. A casino
license is valid for a period of one year and the Michigan Board may refuse to renew it upon a determination that the licensee no longer meets the requirements for licensure.

The
Michigan Board may, among other things, revoke, suspend or restrict a casino license. Substantial fines or forfeiture of assets for violations of gaming laws or rules may also be
levied against a casino licensee. In the event that a casino license is revoked or suspended for more than 120 days, the Michigan Act provides for the appointment of a conservator who, among
other things, is required to sell or otherwise transfer the assets of the casino licensee or former licensee to another person or entity who meets the requirements of the Michigan Act for licensure.

The
Michigan Board has adopted administrative rules, which became effective on June 23, 1998, to implement the terms of the Michigan Act. Among other things, the rules impose
more detailed substantive and procedural requirements with respect to casino licensing and operations. Included are requirements regarding such things as licensing investigations and hearings, record
keeping and retention, contracting, reports to the Michigan Board, internal control and accounting procedures, security and surveillance, extensions of credit to gaming patrons, conduct of gaming, and
transfers of ownership interests in licensed casinos. The rules also establish numerous Michigan Board procedures regarding licensing, disciplinary


and other hearings, and similar matters. The rules have the force of law and are binding on the Michigan Board as well as on applicants for or holders of casino licenses.

The
Detroit City Council enacted an ordinance entitled "Casino Gaming Authorization and Casino Development Agreement Certification and Compliance." The ordinance authorizes casino
gaming only by operators who are licensed by the Michigan Board and are parties to a development agreement which has been approved and certified by the City Council and is currently in effect or are
acting on behalf of such party. The development agreement between MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, Detroit and the Economic Development Corporation of Detroit has been so approved and certified and is
currently in effect. The ordinance requires each casino operator to submit to the Mayor of Detroit and to the City Council periodic reports regarding the operator's compliance with its development
agreement or, in the event of non-compliance, reasons for non-compliance and an explanation of efforts to comply. The ordinance requires the Mayor of Detroit to monitor each
casino operator's compliance with its development agreement, to take appropriate enforcement action in the event of default and to notify the City Council of defaults and enforcement action taken and,
if a development agreement is terminated, it requires the City Council to transmit notice of such action to the Michigan Board within five business days along with Detroit's request that the Michigan
Board revoke the relevant operator's certificate of suitability or casino license. If a development agreement is terminated, the Michigan Act requires the Michigan Board to revoke the relevant
operator's casino license upon the request of Detroit.

The
Michigan Act effectively provides that each of the three casinos in Detroit shall pay a wagering tax equal to 18% of its adjusted gross receipts, to be paid 8.1% to Michigan and
9.9% to Detroit, an annual municipal service fee equal to the greater of $4 million or 1.25% of its adjusted gross receipts to be paid to Detroit to defray its cost of hosting casinos and an
annual assessment, as adjusted based upon a consumer price index, in the initial amount of approximately $8.3 million to be paid by each casino to Michigan to defray its regulatory enforcement
and other casino-related costs. These are in addition to the taxes, fees and assessments customarily paid by business entities situated in Detroit.

Mississippi Government Regulation

We conduct our Mississippi gaming operations through an indirect subsidiary, Beau Rivage Resorts, Inc., which owns and operates the Beau Rivage casino
in the City of Biloxi, Mississippi. The ownership and operation of casino facilities in Mississippi are subject to extensive state and local regulation, but primarily the licensing and regulatory
control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi State Tax Commission.

The
Mississippi Gaming Control Act, which legalized dockside casino gaming in Mississippi, was enacted on June 29, 1990. Although not identical, the Mississippi Act is similar
to the Nevada Gaming Control Act. Effective October 29, 1991, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted regulations in furtherance of the Mississippi Act which are also similar in many respects
to the Nevada gaming regulations.


The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of Mississippi and the Mississippi Gaming Commission seek to:

•

prevent
unsavory or unsuitable persons from having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;

•

establish
and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;

•

maintain
effective control over the financial practices of licensees, including establishing minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and
safeguarding of assets and revenues, providing reliable record keeping and making periodic reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission;

•

prevent
cheating and fraudulent practices;

•

provide
a source of state and local revenues through taxation and licensing fees; and

•

ensure
that gaming licensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents.

The
regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Changes in Mississippi law or the regulations or the Mississippi Gaming Commission's
interpretations thereof may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted, and could have a material adverse effect on us and our Mississippi gaming operations.

The
Mississippi Act provides for legalized dockside gaming at the discretion of the 14 counties that either border the Gulf Coast or the Mississippi River, but only if the voters in
such counties have not voted to prohibit gaming in that county. As of January 1, 2001, dockside gaming was permissible in nine of the 14 eligible counties in the state and gaming operations had
commenced in Adams, Coahoma, Hancock, Harrison, Tunica, Warren and Washington counties. Under Mississippi law, gaming vessels
must be located on the Mississippi River or on navigable waters in eligible counties along the Mississippi River, or in the waters of the State of Mississippi lying south of the state in eligible
counties along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The law permits unlimited stakes gaming on permanently moored vessels on a 24-hour basis and does not restrict the percentage of space which may
be utilized for gaming. There are no limitations on the number of gaming licenses which may be issued in Mississippi. The legal age for gaming in Mississippi is 21.

Beau
Rivage Resorts and Beau Rivage Distribution Corp. ("BRDC"), a subsidiary of Beau Rivage Resorts, are subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission. Beau Rivage Resorts is licensed as a Mississippi gaming operator, and BRDC is licensed as a Mississippi distributor of gaming devices. Gaming licenses require the periodic payment of fees
and taxes and are not transferable. Gaming licenses are issued for a maximum term of three years and must be renewed periodically thereafter. Beau Rivage Resorts received its Mississippi gaming
license on June 20, 1996 and a renewal on June 21, 1998. BRDC received its Mississippi distributor's license on August 20, 1998. On May 18, 2000, the Mississippi Gaming
Commission renewed the licenses of both Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC for terms of three years each, effective June 22, 2000.

On
May 18, 2000, the Mississippi Gaming Commission registered MGM MIRAGE under the Mississippi Act as a publicly traded holding company of Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC. As a
registered publicly traded holding company, MGM MIRAGE is subject to the licensing and regulatory control of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and is required to periodically submit detailed
financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and furnish any other information which the Mississippi Gaming Commission may require. If MGM MIRAGE is unable to satisfy
the registration requirements of the Mississippi Act, MGM MIRAGE and its licensed subsidiaries cannot own or operate gaming facilities in Mississippi. Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC are also required to
periodically submit detailed financial, operating and other reports to the Mississippi Gaming Commission and the Mississippi State Tax Commission and to furnish any other information required thereby.
No person may become a


stockholder of or receive any percentage of profits from a licensed subsidiary of a holding company without first obtaining licenses and approvals from the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

Certain
of our officers, directors and employees must be found suitable or be licensed by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. We believe that we have applied for all necessary findings
of suitability with respect to these persons, although the Mississippi Gaming Commission, in its discretion, may require additional persons to file applications for findings of suitability. In
addition, any person having a material relationship or involvement with us may be required to be found suitable, in which case those persons must pay the costs and fees associated with the
investigation. A finding of suitability requires submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. There can be no assurance that a person who is subject
to a finding of suitability will be found suitable
by the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may deny an application for a finding of suitability for any cause that it deems reasonable. Findings of suitability must be
periodically renewed.

Changes
in certain licensed positions must be reported to the Mississippi Gaming Commission. In addition to its authority to deny an application for a finding of suitability, the
Mississippi Gaming Commission has jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a licensed position. The Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to require us to suspend or dismiss officers, directors
and other key employees or sever relationships with other persons who refuse to file appropriate applications or whom the authorities find unsuitable to act in their capacities.

Employees
associated with gaming must obtain work permits that are subject to immediate suspension. The Mississippi Gaming Commission will refuse to issue a work permit to a person
convicted of a felony and it may refuse to issue a work permit to a gaming employee if the employee has committed various misdemeanors or knowingly violated the Mississippi Act or for any other
reasonable cause.

At
any time, the Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to investigate and require a finding of suitability of any record or beneficial stockholders of a publicly traded
corporation registered with the Mississippi Gaming Commission, regardless of the percentage of ownership. Mississippi law requires any person who acquires more than 5% of the voting securities of a
publicly traded corporation registered with the Mississippi Gaming Commission to report the acquisition to the Mississippi Gaming Commission, and that person may be required to be found suitable.
Also, any person who becomes a beneficial owner of more than 10% of the voting securities of such a company, as reported to the Commission, must apply for a finding of suitability by the Mississippi
Gaming Commission. An applicant for finding of suitability must pay the costs and fees that the Mississippi Gaming Commission incurs in conducting the investigation. The Mississippi Gaming Commission
has generally exercised its discretion to require a finding of suitability of any beneficial owner of more than 5% of a registered public company's voting securities. However, the Mississippi Gaming
Commission has adopted a policy that may permit institutional investors to own beneficially up to 10% and, under certain circumstances, up to 15%, of a registered public company's voting securities
without a finding of suitability.

Under
certain circumstances, an "institutional investor," as defined by the Mississippi Gaming Commission's Policy on Findings of Suitability of Institutional Shareholders (adopted
January 20, 2000), which acquires more than 10% but not more than 15% of a registered public company's voting securities, may apply to the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission for a waiver of such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor shall not be deemed to hold
voting securities for investment purposes unless the voting securities were acquired and are held in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor and not for the purpose of causing,
directly or indirectly, the election of a majority of the members of the board of directors of the registered public company, any change in the registered public company's corporate charter, bylaws,
management, policies or operations of the
registered public company or any of its gaming affiliates, or any other action which the Mississippi Gaming Commission finds to be inconsistent


with holding the registered public company's voting securities for investment purposes only. Activities that are not deemed to be inconsistent with holding voting securities for investment purposes
only include:

•

voting,
directly or indirectly through the delivery of a proxy furnished by the board of directors, on all matters voted upon by the holders of such voting
securities;

•

serving
as a member of any committee of creditors or security holders;

•

nominating
any candidate for election or appointment to the board of directors in connection with a debt restructuring;

•

accepting
appointment or election (or having a representative accept appointment or election) as a member of the board of directors in connection with a
debt restructuring and serving in that capacity until the conclusion of the member's term;

•

making
financial and other inquiries of management of the type normally made by securities analysts for informational purposes and not to cause a change in
its management, policies or operations; and

•

such
other activities as the Mississippi Gaming Commission may determine to be consistent with such investment intent.

If
a stockholder who must be found suitable is a corporation, partnership or trust, it must submit detailed business and financial information including a list of beneficial owners.
The Mississippi Gaming Commission may at any time dissolve, suspend, condition, limit or restrict a finding of suitability to own a registered public company's equity interests for any cause it deems
reasonable.

We
may be required to disclose to the Mississippi Gaming Commission upon request the identities of the holders of any debt or other securities. In addition, under the Mississippi Act,
the Mississippi Gaming Commission may, in its discretion:

•

require
holders of debt securities of registered corporations to file applications;

•

investigate
the holders; and

•

require
the holders to be found suitable to own the debt securities.

Although
the Mississippi Gaming Commission generally does not require the individual holders of obligations such as notes to be investigated and found suitable, the Mississippi Gaming
Commission retains the discretion to do so for any reason, including but not limited to a default, or where the holder of the debt instrument exercises a material influence over the gaming operations
of the entity in question. Any holder of debt securities required to apply for a finding of suitability must pay all investigative fees and costs of the Mississippi Gaming Commission in connection
with the investigation.

Any
person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the Mississippi Gaming Commission may be found
unsuitable. Any person found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our securities beyond the time that the Mississippi Gaming Commission prescribes, may be
guilty of a misdemeanor. We will be subject to disciplinary action if, after receiving notice that a person is unsuitable to be a stockholder, a holder of our debt securities or to have any other
relationship with us, we:

•

pay
the unsuitable person any dividend, interest or other distribution whatsoever;

•

recognize
the exercise, directly or indirectly, of any voting rights conferred through such securities held by the unsuitable person;

•

pay
the unsuitable person any remuneration in any form for services rendered or otherwise, except in limited and specific circumstances;


•

make
any payment to the unsuitable person by way of principal, redemption, conversion, exchange, liquidation or similar transaction; or

•

fail
to pursue all lawful efforts to require the unsuitable person to divest himself or herself of the securities, including, if necessary, the immediate
purchase of the securities for cash at a fair market value.

Beau
Rivage Resorts and BRDC must maintain in Mississippi a current ledger with respect to the ownership of their equity securities and MGM MIRAGE must maintain in Mississippi a
current list of its stockholders which must reflect the record ownership of each outstanding share of any equity security issued by MGM MIRAGE. The ledger and stockholder lists must be available for
inspection by the Mississippi Gaming Commission at any time. If any of our securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the
beneficial owner to the Mississippi Gaming Commission. A failure to make that disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. The company must also render maximum assistance in
determining the identity of the beneficial owner.

The
Mississippi Act requires that the certificates representing securities of a registered publicly traded corporation bear a legend to the general effect that the securities are
subject to the Mississippi Act and the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. On May 18, 2000, the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted us a waiver of this legend requirement. The
Mississippi Gaming Commission has the power to impose additional restrictions on us and the holders of our securities at any time.

Substantially
all loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions by a licensed gaming subsidiary must be reported to or approved by the Mississippi Gaming
Commission. A licensed gaming subsidiary may not make a public offering of its securities, but may pledge or mortgage casino facilities if it obtains the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission. We may not make a public offering of our securities without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission if any part of the proceeds of the offering is to be used to finance the
construction, acquisition or operation of gaming facilities in Mississippi or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes. The approval, if given, does not constitute a recommendation
or approval of the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investment merits of the securities subject to the offering. On May 18, 2000, the Mississippi Gaming Commission granted us a
waiver of the prior approval requirement for our securities offerings for a period of two years, subject to certain conditions. The waiver may be rescinded for good cause without prior notice upon the
issuance of an interlocutory stop order by the Executive Director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission.

Under
the regulations of the Mississippi Gaming Commission, Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC may not guarantee a security issued by MGM MIRAGE pursuant to a public offering, or pledge
their assets to secure payment or performance of the obligations evidenced by such a security issued by MGM MIRAGE, without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Similarly, MGM
MIRAGE may not pledge the stock or other ownership interests of Beau Rivage Resorts or BRDC, nor may the pledgee of such ownership interests foreclose on such a pledge, without the prior approval of
the Mississippi Gaming Commission. Moreover, restrictions on the transfer of an equity security issued by Beau Rivage Resorts or BRDC and agreements not to encumber such securities granted by MGM
MIRAGE are ineffective without the prior approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The waiver of the prior approval requirement for MGM MIRAGE's securities offerings received from the Mississippi
Gaming Commission on May 18, 2000 includes a waiver of the prior approval requirement for such guarantees, pledges and restrictions of Beau Rivage Resorts and BRDC, subject to certain
conditions.

MGM
MIRAGE cannot change its control through merger, consolidation, acquisition of assets, management or consulting agreements or any form of takeover without the prior approval of
the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may also require controlling stockholders, officers, directors, and other persons having a material relationship or involvement
with the


entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.

The
Mississippi Legislature has declared that some corporate acquisitions opposed by management, repurchases of voting securities and other corporate defensive tactics that affect
corporate gaming licensees in Mississippi and corporations whose stock is publicly traded that are affiliated with those licensees may be injurious to stable and productive corporate gaming. The
Mississippi Gaming Commission has established a regulatory scheme to ameliorate the potentially adverse effects of these business practices upon Mississippi's gaming industry and to further
Mississippi's policy to:

•

assure
the financial stability of corporate gaming operators and their affiliates;

•

preserve
the beneficial aspects of conducting business in the corporate form; and

•

promote
a neutral environment for the orderly governance of corporate affairs.

MGM
MIRAGE may be required to obtain approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission before it may make exceptional repurchases of voting securities in excess of the current market
price of its common stock (commonly called "greenmail") or before it may consummate a corporate acquisition opposed by management. The regulations also require prior approval by the Mississippi Gaming
Commission if MGM MIRAGE adopts a plan of recapitalization proposed by its Board of Directors opposing a tender offer made directly to the stockholders for the purpose of acquiring control of MGM
MIRAGE.

Neither
MGM MIRAGE nor Beau Rivage Resorts may engage in gaming activities in Mississippi while MGM MIRAGE, Beau Rivage Resorts and/or persons found suitable to be associated with the
gaming license of Beau Rivage Resorts conduct gaming operations outside of Mississippi without approval of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. The Mississippi Gaming Commission may require means for it
to have access to information concerning MGM MIRAGE's and its affiliates' out-of-state gaming operations. Gaming operations in Nevada were approved when Beau Rivage Resorts was
first licensed in Mississippi. MGM MIRAGE received waivers of foreign gaming approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission on May 18, 2000 for the conduct of gaming operations in Michigan,
New Jersey, Northern Territory (Australia), Mpumalanga Province (Republic of South Africa) and Gauteng Province (Republic of South Africa), and may be required to obtain the approval or a waiver of
such approval from the Mississippi Gaming Commission before engaging in any additional future gaming operations outside of Mississippi.

If
the Mississippi Gaming Commission decides that a licensed gaming subsidiary violated a gaming law or regulation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could limit, condition, suspend
or revoke the license of the subsidiary. In addition, we, the licensed subsidiary and the persons involved could be subject to substantial fines for each separate violation. A violation under any of
MGM MIRAGE's other operating subsidiaries' gaming licenses may be deemed a violation of Beau Rivage Resorts' gaming license. Because of a violation, the Mississippi Gaming Commission could attempt to
appoint a supervisor to operate the casino facilities. Limitation, conditioning or suspension of Beau Rivage Resorts' gaming license or MGM MIRAGE's registration as a publicly traded holding company
of Beau Rivage Resorts, or the appointment of a supervisor could, and the revocation of any gaming license or registration would, materially adversely affect our Mississippi gaming operations.

A
licensed gaming subsidiary must pay license fees and taxes, computed in various ways depending on the type of gaming involved, to the State of Mississippi and to the county or city
in which the licensed gaming subsidiary conducts operations. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable either monthly, quarterly or annually and are based
upon:

•

a
percentage of the gross gaming revenues received by the casino operations;

•

the
number of slot machines operated by the casino; and

•

the
number of table games operated by the casino.


The
license fee payable to the State of Mississippi is based upon "gaming receipts," generally defined as gross receipts less payouts to customers as winnings, and equals:

•

4%
of gaming receipts of $50,000 or less per month;

•

6%
of gaming receipts over $50,000 and less than $134,000 per month; and

•

8%
of gaming receipts over $134,000 per month.

These
license fees are allowed as a credit against our Mississippi income tax liability for the year paid. The gross revenue fee imposed by the Mississippi cities and counties in
which casino operations are located is in addition to the fees payable to the State of Mississippi and equals approximately 4% of the gaming receipts.

The
Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted a regulation in 1994 requiring as a condition of licensure or license renewal that a gaming establishment's plan include a 500 car parking
facility in close proximity to the casino complex and infrastructure facilities which will amount to at least 25% of the casino cost. Infrastructure facilities are defined in the regulation to include
a hotel with at least 250 rooms, theme park, golf course and other similar facilities. With the opening of its resort hotel and other amenities, Beau Rivage Resorts is in compliance with this
requirement. On January 21, 1999, the Mississippi Gaming Commission adopted an amendment to this regulation which increased the infrastructure requirement to 100% from the existing 25%;
however, the regulation grandfathers existing licensees and applies only to new casino projects and casinos that are not operating at the time
of acquisition or purchase, and would therefore not apply to Beau Rivage Resorts. In any event, Beau Rivage would comply with such requirement.

Both
the local jurisdiction and the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division of the Mississippi State Tax Commission license, control and regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages by Beau
Rivage Resorts. Beau Rivage is in an area designated as a special resort area, which allows casinos located therein to serve alcoholic beverages on a 24-hour basis. The Alcohol Beverage
Control Division has the full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license for the service of alcoholic beverages or to place a licensee on probation with or without conditions. Any
disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon the casino's operations. MGM MIRAGE's and Beau Rivage Resorts' key officers and managers must be investigated by
the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division in connection with its liquor permits and changes in key positions must be approved by the Alcoholic Beverage Control Division.

Australia Government Regulation

The Northern Territory of Australia, like Nevada, has comprehensive laws and regulations governing the conduct of gaming. Our Australian operations are subject
to the Gaming Control Act of 1993 and regulations promulgated thereunder and to the licensing and general control of the Minister for Racing and Gaming. MGM Grand Australia Pty Ltd. has entered
into a casino operator's agreement with the Minister pursuant to which MGM Grand Australia was granted a license to conduct casino gaming on an exclusive basis through June 30, 2015 in the
northern half of the Northern Territory (which includes Darwin, its largest city, where MGM Grand Australia is located). The license provides for a tax payable to the Northern Territory government on
gross profits derived from gaming, including gaming devices. The license is not exclusive with respect to gaming devices, and the Minister may permit such devices to be placed in limited numbers in
locations not operated by MGM Grand Australia. However, under the license, through June 30, 2005 a portion of the operators' win on such gaming devices is to be offset against gaming tax
otherwise payable by MGM Grand Australia.

The
license may be terminated if MGM Grand Australia breaches the casino operator's agreement or the Northern Territory law or fails to operate in accordance with the requirements of
the license. The Northern Territory authorities have the right under the Northern Territory law, the casino operator's


agreement and the license to monitor and approve virtually all aspects of the conduct of gaming by MGM Grand Australia.

Additionally,
under the terms of the license, the Minister has the right to approve the directors and corporate secretary of MGM MIRAGE and its subsidiaries which own or operate MGM
Grand Australia, as well as changes in the ownership or corporate structure of such subsidiaries. MGM MIRAGE is required to file with the Northern Territory authorities copies of all documents
required to be filed by MGM MIRAGE or any of its subsidiaries with the Nevada gaming authorities. In the event of any person becoming the beneficial owner of 10% or more of our outstanding stock, the
Minister must be so notified and may investigate the suitability of such person. If the Minister determines such person to be unsuitable and following such determination such person remains the
beneficial owner of 10% or more of our stock, that would constitute a default under the license.

New Jersey Government Regulation

The ownership and operation of hotel-casino facilities and gaming activities in Atlantic City, New Jersey are subject to extensive state regulation under the
New Jersey Casino Control Act and the regulations of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and other applicable laws. In order to operate a hotel-casino property in New Jersey, a company must
obtain a license from the New Jersey Commission and obtain numerous other licenses, permits and approvals from other state as well as local governmental authorities. The New Jersey Act also
established the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement to investigate all license applications, enforce the provisions of the New Jersey Act and regulations and prosecute all proceedings for
violations of the New Jersey Act and regulations before the New Jersey Commission.

The
New Jersey Commission has broad discretion regarding the issuance, renewal, revocation and suspension of casino licenses. The New Jersey Act and regulations concern primarily the
good character, honesty, integrity and financial stability of casino licensees, their intermediary and holding companies, their employees, their security holders and others financially interested in
casino operations; financial and accounting practices used in connection with casino operations; rules of games, levels of supervision of games and methods of selling and redeeming chips; manner of
granting credit, duration of credit and enforceability of gaming debts; and distribution of alcoholic beverages.

Our
wholly owned subsidiary, MGM Grand Atlantic City, Inc., has applied to be licensed by the New Jersey Commission to operate a casino, and MGM MIRAGE has applied to be
approved as a qualified holding company. On July 24, 1996, MGM MIRAGE and MGM Grand Atlantic City, Inc., and their then officers, directors, and 5% or greater shareholders were found
suitable for licensing by the New Jersey Commission. On June 27, 1995, the New Jersey Commission found Mirage and its then officers, directors and 5% or greater shareholders suitable for
licensing. These findings of suitability are subject to review and revision by the New Jersey Commission based upon a change in any material fact that is relevant to the findings.

The
New Jersey Act further provides that each person who directly or indirectly holds any beneficial interest or ownership of the securities issued by a casino licensee or any of its
intermediary or holding companies, those persons who, in the opinion of the New Jersey Commission, have the ability to control the casino licensee or its intermediary or holding companies or elect a
majority of the board of directors of such companies, other than a banking or other licensed lending institution which makes a loan or holds a mortgage or other lien acquired in the ordinary course of
business, lenders and underwriters of such companies are required to be qualified by the New Jersey Commission. However, with respect to a publicly traded holding company such as MGM MIRAGE, a waiver
of qualification may be granted by the New Jersey Commission, with the concurrence of the Director of the New Jersey Division, if the New Jersey Commission determines that such persons or entities are
not significantly involved in the activities of a casino licensee and in the case of security holders, do not have the ability to control MGM MIRAGE or elect one or more of its directors. There exists
a rebuttable presumption that any person holding 5% or


more of the equity securities of a casino licensee's intermediary or holding company or a person having the ability to elect one or more of the directors of such a company has the ability to control
the company and thus must obtain qualification from the New Jersey Commission.

Notwithstanding
this presumption of control, the New Jersey Act provides for a waiver of qualification for passive "institutional investors," as defined by the New Jersey Act, if the
institutional investor purchased publicly traded securities for investment purposes only and where such securities constitute less than 10% of the equity securities of a casino licensee's holding or
intermediary company or debt securities of a casino licensee's holding or intermediary company representing a percentage of the outstanding debt of such company not exceeding 20% or a percentage of
any issue of the outstanding debt of such company not exceeding 50%. The waiver of qualification is subject to certain conditions including, upon request of the New Jersey Commission, filing a
certified statement that the institutional investor has no intention of influencing or affecting the affairs of the issuer, except that an institutional investor holding voting securities shall be
permitted to vote on matters put to a vote of the holders of outstanding voting securities. Additionally, a waiver of qualification may also be granted to institutional investors holding a higher
percentage of securities of a casino licensee's holding or intermediary company upon a showing of good cause.

The
New Jersey Act requires the certificate of incorporation of a publicly traded holding company to provide that any securities of such corporation are held subject to the condition
that if a holder is found to be disqualified by the New Jersey Commission pursuant to the New Jersey Act, such holder shall dispose of his interest in such company. Accordingly, we amended our
certificate of incorporation to provide that a holder of our securities must dispose of such securities if the holder is found disqualified under the New Jersey Act. In addition, we amended our
certificate of incorporation to provide that we may redeem the stock of any holder found to be disqualified.

If
the New Jersey Commission should find a security holder to be unqualified to be a holder of securities of a casino licensee or holding company, not only must the disqualified
holder dispose of such securities but in addition, commencing on the date the New Jersey Commission serves notice upon such a company of the determination of disqualification, it shall be unlawful for
the disqualified holder to:

•

receive
any dividends or interest upon any such securities;

•

exercise,
directly or through any trustee or nominee, any right conferred by such securities; or

•

receive
any remuneration in any form from the licensee for services rendered or otherwise.

If
the New Jersey Commission should find a security holder to be unqualified to be a holder of securities of a casino licensee or holding company, the New Jersey Commission shall take
any necessary action to protect the public interest, including the suspension or revocation of the casino license, except that if the disqualified person is the holder of securities of a publicly
traded holding company, the New Jersey Commission shall not take action against the casino license if:

•

the
holding company has the corporate charter provisions concerning divestiture of securities by disqualified owners required by the New Jersey Act;

•

the
holding company has made good faith efforts, including the pursuit of legal remedies, to comply with any order of the New Jersey Commission; and

•

the
disqualified holder does not have the ability to control the company or elect one or more members of the company's board of directors.

If
the New Jersey Commission determines that a casino licensee has violated the New Jersey Act or regulations, or if any security holder of MGM MIRAGE or a casino licensee who is
required to be qualified under the New Jersey Act is found to be disqualified but does not dispose of the securities, a casino licensee could be subject to fines or its license could be suspended or
revoked. If a casino licensee's license is revoked after issuance, the New Jersey Commission could appoint a conservator to operate and


to dispose of the hotel-casino facilities operated by such casino licensee. Net proceeds of a sale by a conservator and net profits of operations by a conservator, at least up to an amount equal to a
fair return on investment which is reasonable for casinos or hotels, would be paid to us.

The
New Jersey Act imposes an annual tax of 8% on gross casino revenues, as defined in the New Jersey Act. In addition, casino licensees are required to invest 1.25% of gross casino
revenues for the purchase of bonds to be issued by the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority or make other approved investments equal to that amount. In the event the investment requirement is not
met, the casino licensee is subject to a tax in the amount of 2.5% on gross casino revenues. The New Jersey Commission has established fees for the issuance or renewal of casino licenses and
hotel-casino alcoholic beverage licenses and an annual license fee on each slot machine.

In
addition to compliance with the New Jersey Act and regulations relating to gaming, any property built in Atlantic City by MGM Grand Atlantic City, Inc. or any other
subsidiary of ours must comply with the New Jersey and Atlantic City laws and regulations relating to, among other things, the Coastal Area Facilities Review Act, construction of buildings,
environmental considerations and the operation of hotels.

Factors that May Affect Our Future Results

(Cautionary
Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995)

This
Form 10-K and our 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders contain some forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or
forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They contain words such as "anticipate," "estimate,"
"expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," "may," "could," "might" and other words or phrases of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance.
In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, new projects, future performance, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings and future financial results. From time to
time, we also provide oral or written forward-looking statements in our Forms 10-Q and 8-K, press releases and other materials we release to the public.

Any
or all of our forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K, in our 2000 Annual Report to Stockholders and in any other public statements we make may turn out to
be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in this Form 10-K—for
example, government regulation and the competitive environment—will be important in determining our future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Our actual
future results may differ materially.

We
undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult
any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Form 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also note that we
provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to
differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors in addition to those listed here could also adversely affect us. This discussion is provided as permitted by the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

•

Our
debt has increased significantly as a result of the acquisition of Mirage. At December 31, 2000, we had approximately $5.9 billion of
indebtedness. The interest rate on a large portion of our long-term debt is subject to fluctuation based on changes in short-term interest rates and the ratings which national
rating agencies assign to our outstanding debt securities. Our bank credit agreements and the indentures governing our debt securities do not prohibit us from borrowing additional funds in the future.
Our interest expense could increase as a result of these factors. Additionally, our indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, limit our
flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and


industry,
limit our ability to borrow additional funds and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other less leveraged competitors. Our ability to reduce our outstanding debt will be
subject to our future cash flows, other capital requirements and other factors, some of which are not within our control.

•

As
described under "Competition," we operate in a very competitive environment, particularly in Las Vegas. To the extent that hotel room capacity is
expanded by others in a market where our hotel-casinos are located, competition will increase. The completion of a number of room expansions and the opening of new hotel-casinos led to an approximate
10% increase in hotel room capacity in Las Vegas in 1999 compared to 1998, thereby increasing competition in all segments of the Las Vegas market. Three new mega-resorts opened in Las
Vegas in 1999 and one opened in 2000. New additions to the Las Vegas market could adversely impact our future results. The business of our Nevada hotel-casinos might also be adversely affected if
gaming operations of the type conducted in Nevada were to be permitted under the laws of other states, particularly California. Similarly, legalization of gaming in any jurisdiction located near
Detroit or Atlantic City, or the establishment of new large-scale gaming
operations on nearby Native American reservations, could adversely affect our Detroit casino or our planned Atlantic City operations. Any expansion of gaming activities in the Gulf Coast region could
have an adverse effect on Beau Rivage.

•

On
March 7, 2000, California voters approved an amendment to the California constitution that gave Native American tribes in California the right to
offer a limited number of slot machines and a range of house-banked card games. A number of tribes have already signed, and others are negotiating, gaming compacts with the State of California. More
than 60 compacts had been approved by the federal government as of December 31, 2000, and casino-style gaming is legal in California on those tribal lands. At this time, we cannot determine the
impact this will have on our Nevada casinos.

•

As
discussed under "Regulation and Licensing," the ownership and operation of gaming facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, provincial and
local laws, regulations and ordinances, which are administered by the relevant regulatory agencies in each jurisdiction. Changes in applicable laws, regulations or ordinances could have a significant
effect on our operations. In addition, we are subject to various gaming taxes, which are subject to possible increase at any time. For example, in January 2000, a Nevada state senator filed an
initiative petition seeking to increase the state gross gaming tax rate from 6


/


% to 11


/


%. In June 1999, the National Gambling Impact Study Commission, which
conducted a two-year study of legal gaming in the United States, reported its findings and recommendations to Congress. Some of the recommendations made in its report, if implemented,
might result in additional regulation of the gaming industry and could have an adverse effect on the industry, including our Company. In Mississippi, in three separate instances, referenda were
proposed which, if approved, would have amended the Mississippi constitution to ban gaming in Mississippi and would have required all currently legal gaming entities to cease operations within two
years of the ban. All three of the proposed referenda have been ruled illegal by Mississippi state trial courts. The proponents of the most recent referendum filed a notice of appeal of the trial
court ruling with the Mississippi Supreme Court, which affirmed the trial court ruling. Any such referendum must be approved by the Mississippi Secretary of State and signatures of approximately
91,700 registered voters must be gathered and certified in order for such a proposal to be included on a statewide ballot for consideration by the voters. The next election for which the proponents
could attempt to place such a proposal on the ballot would be in November 2002. While it is too early in the process for us to make any prediction with respect to whether such a referendum will
appear on a ballot or the likelihood of such a referendum being approved by the voters, if this or any similar initiative were ultimately adopted, it could have a material adverse effect on our
Company.


•

Our
business is affected by local, national and international general economic and market conditions in the locations where we operate and where our
customers live. Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas and The Mirage are particularly affected by the economic situation in the Far East, and all of our Nevada properties are affected by economic conditions
in California. A recession or economic slowdown could cause a reduction in visitation to our properties, which would adversely affect our operating results.

•

We
are a large consumer of electricity and other energy. Accordingly, the substantial increases in energy costs which have recently occurred and are
expected to continue will have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher energy and gasoline prices which affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our properties
and a reduction in our revenues.

•

Many
of our customers travel by air. As a result, the cost and availability of air service can affect our business. Additionally, there is one principal
interstate highway between Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large number of our customers reside. Capacity restraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may affect the number
of customers who visit our facilities.

•

We
are proceeding with the integration of the operations of Mirage. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to integrate these operations
without encountering difficulties. These difficulties could include integrating different business strategies with respect to marketing, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and
corporate cultures, integrating different reservation systems and other technology and managing relationships with other business partners. We have accrued approximately $131 million for costs
associated with the Mirage acquisition and related integration activities, of which approximately $94 million had been expended as of December 31, 2000. We cannot assure that this
accrual will be adequate to cover all of the costs associated with the integration of Mirage into our operations. Furthermore, the integration of operations may temporarily distract management from
our day-to-day business.

•

Our
management believes that the acquisition of Mirage will allow us to achieve significant cost savings relating to duplicative departments, redundant
infrastructure and operating efficiencies, as well revenue enhancement opportunities upon full integration of Mirage. We have already eliminated approximately $117 million of annual costs since
our acquisition of Mirage on May 31, 2000. However, the anticipated further benefits are based on projections and assumptions, not actual results. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will
realize the anticipated benefits. Our ability to realize these benefits could be adversely affected by difficulties in integrating Mirage, the inability to achieve certain economies of scale and other
risks associated with achieving expected revenue enhancements and cost savings.

•

Our
plans for future construction can be affected by a number of factors, including time delays in obtaining necessary governmental permits and approvals
and legal challenges. We may make changes in project scope, budgets and schedules for competitive, aesthetic or other reasons, and these changes may also result from circumstances beyond our control.
These circumstances include weather interference, shortages of materials and labor, work stoppages, labor disputes, unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems and unanticipated cost
increases. Any of these circumstances could give rise to delays or cost overruns. Major expansion projects at our existing resorts can also result in disruption of our business during the construction
period.

•

The
gaming industry represents a significant source of tax revenues, particularly to the State of Nevada and its counties and cities. From time to time,
various state and federal legislators and other officials have proposed changes in tax law, or in the administration of the law, affecting the gaming industry. We believe that our recorded tax
balances are adequate. However, we cannot determine with certainty the likelihood of possible changes in tax law or its administration. These changes, if adopted, could have a material negative effect
on our operating results.


•

Claims
have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. It is
possible that our cash flows and results of operations could be affected by the resolution of these claims. We believe that the ultimate disposition of current matters will not have a material impact
on our financial condition or results of operations. Please see the further discussion under "Legal Proceedings" in Item 3 of this Form 10-K.

•

There
is intense competition to attract and retain qualified management and other employees in the gaming industry. Our inability to recruit or retain
personnel could adversely affect our business.

•

Tracinda
Corporation and its sole stockholder beneficially own approximately 58.5% of our outstanding common stock as of March 9, 2001. As a result,
Tracinda has the ability to elect our entire Board of Directors and determine the outcome of other matters submitted to our stockholders, such as the approval of significant transactions.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

Bellagio occupies an approximately 90-acre site. We own the entire site except for one acre which we lease under a ground lease that expires
(giving effect to our options to renew) in 2073. Our principal executive offices are located at Bellagio.

MGM
Grand Las Vegas occupies an approximately 116-acre site which we own.

The
Mirage and Treasure Island share an approximately 100-acre site which we own.

New
York-New York occupies an approximately 20-acre site which we own.

The
Primm Properties are located on approximately 143 acres. We lease substantially all of the land under a ground lease that expires (giving effect to our renewal option) in 2068. We
own approximately 16 acres immediately north of Buffalo Bill's that are the site of Company-owned mobile homes rented to employees. We also own approximately 573 acres in California, one mile south of
Primm, which is the location of the Primm Valley Golf Club. Approximately 125 of these acres remain available for future development.

The
Primm Properties are not served by a municipal water system. We have rights to water in various wells located on federal land in the vicinity of the Primm Properties and have
received permits to pipe the water to the Primm Properties. These permits and rights are subject to the jurisdiction and ongoing regulatory authority of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, the States
of Nevada and California and local governmental units. We believe that adequate water for the Primm Properties is available; however, we cannot be certain that the future needs will be within the
permitted allowance. Also, we can give no assurance that any future requests for additional water will be approved or that no further requirements will be imposed by governmental agencies on our use
and delivery of water for the Primm Properties.


The Golden Nugget occupies approximately seven and one-half acres. We own the buildings and approximately 90% of the land. We lease the remaining land under three ground
leases that expire (giving effect to our options to renew) on dates from 2025 to 2046.

The
Golden Nugget-Laughlin, including approximately two acres where the motel in Bullhead City, Arizona is located, occupies approximately 15


/


acres, all of which we
own.

Carlo occupies approximately 46 acres owned by Victoria Partners (the joint venture that owns and operates Monte Carlo). At December 31, 2000, Monte Carlo was subject to
a deed of trust securing bank financing of $87 million.

The
Boardwalk occupies an approximately nine-acre site which we own. We also own approximately 45 acres of property adjacent to the Boardwalk which is available for future
development.

Grand Detroit is located on approximately 4.3 acres. The 1.7-acre parcel on which the casino building, additional on-site covered parking and a 640 space
parking garage are located is leased under a ground lease that expires in June 2003. We have the option to renew the lease for up to four successive one year periods. We own the remaining land
which, at December 31, 2000, was subject to a mortgage securing bank financing of approximately $65 million.

Beau
Rivage occupies approximately 41 acres (including 10 acres of tidelands) in Biloxi, Mississippi. We own the land and we lease the tidelands from the State of Mississippi under a
lease that expires (giving effect to our option to renew) in 2049. We also own approximately 508 acres in the Biloxi area for the potential development of a world-class golf course.

MGM
Grand Australia occupies an approximately 18-acre site which we own. At December 31, 2000, MGM Grand Australia was subject to a mortgage securing bank financing
of approximately $25.5 million.

Borgata on a 27-acre portion of the Marina site, adjacent to our largest parcel. The Borgata property is owned by the venture and collateralized by a mortgage securing a bank credit
facility in the amount of up to $630 million, none of which has been borrowed to date.

We
also own or lease various other improved and unimproved property in Las Vegas and other locations in the United States and certain foreign countries.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

On April 26, 1994, an individual filed a complaint in a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida
against 41 manufacturers, distributors and casino operators of video poker and electronic slot machines, including the Company. On May 10, 1994, another plaintiff filed a complaint in a class
action lawsuit alleging substantially the same claims in the same court against 48 defendants, including the Company. On September 26, 1995, another plaintiff filed a complaint in a class
action lawsuit alleging substantially the same claims in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada against 45 defendants, including the Company. The court consolidated the three
cases in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada. The consolidated complaint claims that we and the other defendants have engaged in a course of fraudulent and misleading conduct
intended to induce people to play video poker and electronic slot machines based on a false belief concerning how the gaming machines operate, as well as the chances of winning. Specifically, the
plaintiffs allege that the gaming machines are not truly random as advertised to the public, but are pre-programmed in a predictable and manipulative manner. The complaint alleges
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, as well as claims of common law fraud, unjust enrichment and negligent


misrepresentation, and asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. In December 1997, the court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motions to dismiss the complaint
for failure to state a claim and ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint, which they filed in February 1998. We, along with most of the other defendants, have answered the amended
complaint and continue to deny the allegations contained in the amended complaint. The parties have fully briefed the issues regarding class certification, which are currently pending before the
court. The court has stayed discovery pending resolution of these issues.

In
December 1997, the trustee of the bankruptcy estate of Ken Mizuno ("Mizuno") filed a complaint against Mirage in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District
of California, which was amended in February 1998. The amended complaint claims that Mizuno, a Japanese national, repaid
various debts to Mirage's casinos prior to the commencement of Mizuno's bankruptcy case in June 1992 for which Mizuno was not legally liable and which were not legally collectible under
Japanese law. The amended complaint alleges that these repayments constituted fraudulent transfers under federal and state law and seeks to require Mirage to pay the value of the transfers, totaling
at least $61,418,250, plus interest, to the bankruptcy trustee. In August 1998, the Bankruptcy Court granted Mirage's motion to dismiss the complaint based on the statute of limitations. The
plaintiff appealed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California, which reversed the dismissal in January 1999. Mirage appealed the District Court's ruling to the
Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal. The underlying adversary proceeding was transferred to the District of Nevada while the Ninth Circuit appeal was pending. After the transfer, Mirage moved to dismiss the
adversary proceeding on grounds other than those that were on appeal to the Ninth Circuit. In February 2000, the District Court granted Mirage's motion to dismiss several counts of the
complaint. As a result, the trustee's remaining claims against Mirage are for recovery of payments by Mizuno of the gaming debts of others made within one year of the bankruptcy filing, totaling
approximately $5,500,000. The trustee's attempt to obtain an interlocutory appeal from the Ninth Circuit was denied. In September 2000, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's order,
which held that the trustee's original complaint was timely filed. We intend to continue to defend this case vigorously.

The
Company is a defendant in a similar adversary proceeding in a bankruptcy case pending in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California. The adversary
complaint, which was filed in December 1997, alleges that the debtor, Mizuno, transferred approximately $1.1 million to the Desert Inn, which was then owned by a subsidiary of the
Company, in 1988 and 1989 in payment of casino debts of various individuals. The complaint alleges that these transfers were fraudulent conveyances and seeks damages against the Company in an amount
not less than approximately $1.1 million. The Company answered the complaint in January 1998, denying the allegations and asserting that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which
relief could be granted. Also in January 1998, the Company filed a motion to transfer venue to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Nevada. The Bankruptcy Court denied this
motion without prejudice. In February 1998, the plaintiff indicated his intent to file an amended adversary complaint asserting that Mizuno's payment of his own casino debt at the Desert Inn in
the approximate amount of $20 million also constituted a fraudulent conveyance. In July 1998, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting the Company's motion for dismissal for
failure to state a claim based on statute of limitations grounds. The plaintiff's motion for reconsideration in Bankruptcy Court was denied in November 1998. The plaintiff filed an appeal to
the District Court from the Bankruptcy Court's order granting the Company's motion for dismissal and the Bankruptcy Court's denial of the motion for reconsideration. The District Court heard the
appeal while the Mirage appeal on similar issues was before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal. Because of the Ninth Circuit appeal, the District Court stayed all proceedings pending the ruling of the
Ninth Circuit in the Mirage case. In September 2000, following the Ninth Circuit's ruling in the Mirage case discussed above, the District Court reversed the Bankruptcy Court's ruling in the
Desert Inn case and, in October 2000, remanded the adversary proceeding to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings. We intend to continue to defend this case vigorously.


On September 28, 1999, a former stockholder of our subsidiary which owns and operates the Holiday Inn® Boardwalk hotel-casino filed a first amended complaint in a
putative class action lawsuit in District Court for Clark County, Nevada against Mirage and certain former directors and principal stockholders of the Boardwalk subsidiary. The complaint alleged that
Mirage induced the other defendants to breach their fiduciary duties to Boardwalk's minority stockholders by devising and implementing a scheme by which Mirage acquired Boardwalk at significantly less
than the true value of its shares. The complaint sought an unspecified amount of compensatory damages from Mirage and punitive damages from the other defendants, whom we are required to defend and
indemnify. In June 2000, the court granted our motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The plaintiff has appealed the ruling to the Nevada
Supreme Court. Briefing is currently underway but no date has been set for oral argument before the Nevada Supreme Court.

We
and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other lawsuits, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to our business. We do not believe that the outcome of this
other pending litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the Company.

(1)

EBITDA
consists of operating income plus depreciation and amortization, one-time charges (which consist of master plan asset disposition, preopening and other,
restructuring costs and write-downs and impairments) and corporate expense. EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to operating income, as an indicator of the Company's operating
performance, or as an alternative to cash flows generated by operating, investing or financing activities as an indicator of cash flows, or a measure of liquidity, or as any other measure of
performance determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.


(2)

On
December 13, 1999 the Board of Directors approved an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share to stockholders of record on February 10, 2000. The dividend
was paid on March 1, 2000. As a result of the acquisition of Mirage Resorts, Incorporated, the Company announced on April 19, 2000 that the quarterly dividend policy was discontinued.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Results of Operations

Two major acquisitions had a significant impact on our operating results for 1999 and 2000. The March 1, 1999 acquisition of Primadonna
Resorts, Inc. added the three Primm Properties located at the California/Nevada state line, as well as New York-New York on the Las Vegas Strip. Prior to the acquisition, we had
owned 50% of New York-New York through a joint venture with Primadonna. The May 31, 2000 acquisition of Mirage Resorts, Incorporated added four wholly owned and one joint venture
resort on the Las Vegas Strip, as well as resorts in downtown Las Vegas and Laughlin, Nevada and Biloxi, Mississippi. Additionally, the July 29, 1999 opening of MGM Grand Detroit contributed
significantly to our growth over the last two years.

2000 Compared with 1999

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $3.23 billion, representing an increase of $1.84 billion, or 132%, over the
$1.39 billion recorded in 1999. The Mirage properties generated $1.50 billion of this increase and the Primm Properties and New York-New York provided an additional net
increase of $75 million. MGM Grand Detroit generated $403 million during 2000 versus $173 million for its approximately five months of operation in 1999. The increases at the
Primm Properties, New York-New York and MGM Grand Detroit were generally proportionate to the increase in the length of time each property was included in the consolidated results. MGM
Grand Las Vegas achieved record net revenue of $831 million, representing a 5% increase over the $790 million reported in 1999.

Consolidated
casino revenues for the year ended December 31, 2000 were $1.91 billion, representing an increase of $1.04 billion, or 119%, over the
$874 million achieved in 1999. The Mirage properties accounted for $753 million of the increase. The Primm Properties and New York-New York accounted for an additional
$47 million of casino revenues, generating $276 million in 2000 versus the $229 million recorded in the 10 months these properties were owned during 1999. MGM Grand Detroit
recorded casino revenues of $388 million in 2000, an increase of $222 million from the $166 million achieved in its approximately five months of operation in 1999. The remaining
$18 million increase in casino revenues was achieved at MGM Grand Las Vegas, where casino revenues increased from $447 million in 1999 to a record $465 million in 2000. This
increase was concentrated in the table games area, and was primarily attributable to higher table games volume.

Consolidated
room revenues for 2000 were $621 million, representing an increase of $354 million, or 133%, versus 1999. The Mirage properties generated
$329 million of this increase, while the Primm Properties and New York-New York accounted for another $18 million. The balance of the increase related to MGM Grand Las Vegas,
where room revenues increased from $191 million to $199 million, despite a 3% reduction in available room nights due to a room remodeling project which was completed in
August 2000. Average daily room rate and revenue per available room at MGM Grand Las Vegas each increased by 7% versus the 1999 period, to $110 and $106, respectively.

Consolidated
food and beverage revenues more than tripled, from $162 million in 1999 to $491 million in 2000. The Mirage properties contributed $287 million of
the $329 million increase. Food and beverage revenues at MGM Grand Las Vegas rose by 18%, from $112 million in 1999 to a record $132 million in 2000. This increase was
attributable primarily to increased food and beverage sales at the MGM Grand Conference Center as well as increased beverage sales at the Studio 54 nightclub. The


balance of the consolidated increase was attributable to MGM Grand Detroit, the Primm Properties and New York-New York.

Consolidated
entertainment, retail and other revenues for 2000 were $472 million, an increase of $275 million, or 140%, over the $197 million reported in 1999.
This increase was also primarily attributable to the Mirage properties, which contributed $264 million of the increase.

Income
from unconsolidated affiliate of $22 million for 2000 represented our 50% share of the operating results of Monte Carlo since the joint venture interest was acquired as
part of the Mirage acquisition. The $6 million recorded in 1999 represented our 50% share of the operating results of New York-New York for the first two months of 1999, after which
New York-New York became a wholly owned subsidiary.

Consolidated
operating expenses (before preopening expenses, restructuring costs, write-downs and impairments and corporate expense) were $2.53 billion in 2000, representing an
increase of $1.43 billion, or 131%, over the $1.10 billion recorded in 1999. The Mirage properties generated $1.20 billion of this increase and the Primm Properties and New
York-New York had an additional net increase of $57 million. MGM Grand Detroit reported $279 million during 2000 versus $127 million for its approximately five months
of operation in 1999. Operating margins were generally consistent between the years with the exception of MGM Grand Detroit, which showed strong improvement resulting from cost containment measures
and improved operating efficiencies achieved following commencement of operations at this new facility.

During
the year ended December 31, 2000, management implemented comprehensive restructuring plans designed to reduce costs and improve efficiencies within the Company. The
implementation of these plans resulted in a charge against earnings totaling $24 million ($15 million, net of tax), primarily related to consolidation of certain general and
administrative functions at New York-New York and MGM Grand Las Vegas, various contract terminations and staffing reductions, the buyout of various leases and other related items.
Approximately 195 people were affected by the reductions, primarily at our operating properties (excluding the Mirage properties) relating to duplicative functions within marketing, entertainment,
retail, information systems and human resources.

During
June 2000, we recognized a charge against earnings of $102 million ($66 million, net of tax) related to certain projects previously under development which
management has determined not to pursue, the divesting of certain non-strategic assets and the re-evaluation of certain other assets, all as a result of the Mirage acquisition.

Corporate
expense increased to $34 million in 2000 versus $14 million in 1999. This increase was primarily attributable to the Mirage acquisition, reflecting higher
corporate operating expenses related to a larger corporate structure and higher airplane costs due to the operation of two corporate airplanes in the current year compared to only one in the prior
year.

Interest
income increased from $2 million in 1999 to $13 million in 2000. This increase was largely the result of interest earned on cash temporarily invested prior to
its use in the Mirage acquisition, as well as a somewhat higher level of invested cash balances associated with the significant increase in the size of our operations.

Interest
expense, net for 2000 was $273 million, versus $60 million in the prior year. This increase was a function of substantial increases both in interest cost and
interest capitalized, each as a result of the Mirage acquisition. Interest cost was $364 million in 2000 versus $76 million in 1999, as our total debt increased from $1.31 billion
at December 31, 1999 to $5.87 billion at December 31, 2000. This increase is reflective of the debt issued and assumed in connection with the Mirage acquisition. Interest
capitalized increased to $91 million from the $16 million recorded in the prior year. A substantial majority of the interest capitalized in 2000 related to development projects on the
Las Vegas Strip and in the Marina area of Atlantic City, on development sites acquired in the Mirage acquisition. In January 2001, we announced


that our near-term development focus would be on the Atlantic City market. As a result, we have suspended the capitalization of interest on the Las Vegas Strip project until the
development process for that project is further advanced.

Extraordinary
loss of $5 million in 2000, net of income tax benefit, reflects the write-off of unamortized debt costs from our previous $1.25 billion
revolving credit facility and from the portion of the $1.3 billion term loan extinguished during the year. Extraordinary loss of $1 million in 1999, net of income tax benefit, reflects
the write-off of unamortized debt costs from the New York-New York bank facility, which was extinguished on March 31, 1999.

1999 Compared with 1998

Net revenues for the year ended December 31, 1999 were $1.39 billion, representing an increase of $619 million, or 80%, versus the
$773 million recorded in the prior year. The increase in net revenues was due to growth in every revenue segment at existing properties, as well as the addition of the Primm Properties and the
remaining 50% share of New York-New York on March 1, 1999 and the opening of MGM Grand Detroit on July 29, 1999.

Consolidated
casino revenues for 1999 were $874 million, representing an increase of $463 million, or 113%, over the $411 million achieved in 1999. The
acquisition of the Primm Properties and New York-New York accounted for $229 million of the increase, while MGM Grand Detroit contributed $166 million following its opening.
The remaining $68 million increase in casino revenues was achieved principally at MGM Grand Las Vegas, where casino revenues increased from $383 million in 1998 to $447 million in
1999. This increase was primarily the result of higher table games volume (excluding baccarat), a more normalized table games win percentage and increased slot volume.

Consolidated
room revenues for 1999 were $266 million, representing an increase of $84 million, or 46%, when compared with $182 million during 1998. MGM Grand Las
Vegas room revenues increased by $11 million, or 6%, to $191 million. The increase was due to a two percentage point increase in occupancy and a 4% increase in average daily rate. The
remainder of the increase was due to the $73 million of room revenues contributed by the Primm Properties and New York-New York.

Consolidated
food and beverage revenues increased by $55 million, or 51%, to $162 million in 1999. The increase was due primarily to the addition of the new properties,
as the Primm Properties and New York-New York generated $34 million while MGM Grand Detroit contributed $10 million. The remainder of the increase was at MGM Grand Las Vegas,
where food and beverage revenues increased by $11 million, to $112 million. These increases resulted from additional food and beverage sales at the
MGM Grand Conference Center, which opened on April 16, 1998, as well as increases at the Studio 54 nightclub and the Grand Buffet, which had been closed for remodeling during part of 1998,
offset in part by decreased revenue from the Studio Cafe due to its closure for remodeling during part of 1999.

Consolidated
entertainment, retail and other revenues were $197 million during 1999, representing an increase of $95 million, or 94%, from the $102 million
recorded in 1998. MGM Grand Las Vegas contributed a strong $24 million, or 24%, increase to $123 million in 1999. This increase included revenues from two heavyweight boxing matches, as
well as increased tenant rental and spa revenues and the addition of the wedding chapel and other amenities in 1999. The remainder of the increase was due primarily to the addition of the Primm
Properties and New York-New York, which generated $65 million of entertainment, retail and other revenues in 1999.

Income
from unconsolidated affiliate, representing our 50% share of New York-New York's operating results, was $6 million in 1999 versus $38 million in 1998.
This decline was the result of our acquisition of the remaining 50% interest in New York-New York on March 1, 1999, and the resulting inclusion of New York-New York in
our consolidated results from that date forward.


Consolidated operating expenses (before preopening expenses, restructuring costs, write-downs and impairments and corporate expense) were $1.10 billion in 1999, representing an
increase of $466 million, or 74%, over the $631 million recorded in 1998. The addition of the Primm Properties and New York-New York accounted for $272 million of this
increase and the opening of MGM Grand Detroit added another $127 million. The remainder of the increase was substantially all at MGM Grand Las Vegas, where operating expenses increased by
$61 million, or 10%, from $607 million in 1998 to $668 million in 1999. The increase in operating expenses generally followed the increase in related revenues.

Preopening
expense and other of $71 million for 1999 principally represented costs associated with the opening of MGM Grand Detroit, expansion activities at MGM Grand Las Vegas
and certain tender offer costs.

Corporate
expense for 1999 was $14 million, representing a $4 million increase over the $10 million in 1998. The increase was largely due to non-cash
amortization expense in 1999 associated with the issuance of stock options to non-employees.

Interest
income was $2 million for 1999, representing an $11 million decrease from the $13 million earned in 1998. The decrease was attributable to lower invested
cash balances compared with the earlier year.

Interest
expense, net for the year ended December 31, 1999 of $60 million increased by $35 million when compared with the $25 million recorded in 1998,
reflecting increased outstanding loan balances related to construction of MGM Grand Detroit, as well as debt assumed in the Primadonna acquisition. Also, we incurred additional interest expense during
1999 due to debt incurred to fund the repurchase of 12 million of our common shares in July 1999. Interest expense from unconsolidated affiliate declined from $8 million in 1998
to $1 million in 1999, reflecting New York-New York becoming a wholly owned subsidiary on March 1, 1999.

Cumulative
effect of change in accounting principle of $8 million in 1999, net of income tax benefit, reflects our adoption of Statement of Position 98-5, which
requires that costs associated with start-up activities be expensed as incurred.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2000 and December 31, 1999, we held cash and cash equivalents of $228 million and $122 million, respectively.
Cash provided by operating activities for 2000 was $818 million, compared with $290 million for 1999 and $172 million for 1998.

On
May 31, 2000, we completed the Mirage acquisition whereby Mirage shareholders received $21 per share in cash. Funds needed to complete the acquisition were approximately
$6.2 billion. These funds were used for payments to Mirage shareholders and holders of Mirage stock options, refinancing of certain indebtedness of Mirage and MGM Grand, payment of fees and
expenses in connection with the Mirage acquisition and general corporate purposes. In order to fund the Mirage acquisition, we borrowed $4.21 billion under our new senior credit facilities,
completed the private placement of 46.5 million shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of approximately $1.23 billion, issued $710 million of senior subordinated
notes and used cash on hand to fund the remaining balance.

During
2000, $118 million was drawn down on the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility and $730 million was repaid, including a final balance of
$700 million that was refinanced via borrowings under the new senior facilities. During 2000, $4.21 billion was drawn down and $1.30 billion was repaid on the new senior
facilities and $2.91 billion remained outstanding at the end of the year. Also during 2000, $26 million was drawn down and $130 million was repaid on the Detroit credit facility
and $65 million remained outstanding at the end of the year.


On
May 5, 2000, our shelf registration statement, which allows us to issue up to a total of $2.75 billion of debt and equity securities from time to time in public
offerings, was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. After giving effect to the issuance of $710 million of senior subordinated notes to partially fund the Mirage
acquisition and the issuance of $850 million of senior notes, the proceeds of which were used to partially repay the $1.3 billion term loan component of the new senior facilities, the
shelf registration statement had $1.19 billion in remaining capacity at December 31, 2000 for the issuance of future debt or equity securities. On January 23, 2001, we issued an
additional $400 million of senior subordinated notes (also used to repay a portion of the term loan) under the shelf registration statement, leaving remaining capacity of $790 million.
Any future public offering of securities under the shelf registration statement will only be made by means of a prospectus supplement.

We
intend to refinance the remaining balance of the $1.3 billion term loan and the $1 billion revolving credit facility (another element of the new senior facilities)
prior to or upon their April 6, 2001 maturities through the amendment and renewal of those facilities or through other financing alternatives.

During
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, our capital expenditures were $336 million, $375 million and $362 million, respectively. The 2000
capital expenditures related to general property improvements at our resorts, including the recently completed room refurbishment program at MGM Grand Las Vegas, the acquisition of land by MGM Grand
Detroit and other land acquisitions and pre-construction activities associated with ongoing development projects, including capitalized interest. During 1999, $83 million was
expended on MGM Grand Las Vegas master plan improvements, which were completed in early 2000, and $162 million was expended on the development of the MGM Grand Detroit interim casino. During
1998, $305 million was spent on MGM Grand Las Vegas master plan improvements.

In
November 1997, MGM Grand Detroit, LLC (in which we hold a controlling interest) was selected to be the developer of one of three permanent hotel-casino complexes to be
located in the City of Detroit. The MGM Grand Detroit permanent facility is expected to include a 100,000 square foot casino, an 800-room hotel with ballroom, convention and meeting rooms,
restaurants, bars, entertainment and retail facilities. The total project cost could exceed $800 million and development could take up to four years. Development of the permanent facility will
not proceed until after acquisition by MGM Grand Detroit, LLC of the permanent development site from the City of Detroit, which is attempting to acquire land parcels for the site from a number of
independent land owners. The design, budget and schedule for development of the permanent facility are at a preliminary stage, will be subject to the risks attendant to large-scale projects and may be
subject to additional costs and
delays beyond preliminary estimates. No assurance can be given that we will develop a permanent hotel-casino in Detroit, or if we do, as to its ultimate size, configuration or cost.

In
January 1998, the City of Atlantic City deeded to Mirage approximately 180 acres (120 acres of which are developable) in the Marina area of Atlantic City. In exchange,
Mirage agreed to develop a hotel-casino on the site and perform certain other obligations. Mirage also entered into an agreement with two New Jersey State agencies for the construction and joint
funding of road improvements necessary to improve access to the Marina area. As called for by the agreement, in October 1997, Mirage funded its $110 million portion and one of the State
agencies funded its $125 million portion of the $330 million estimated total cost of the road improvements. Each party deposited its funds into escrow accounts and the funds are
restricted for construction of the road improvement projects. The other State agency provided the remaining $95 million estimated cost of the project. There is a fixed-price design/build
contract for the road improvement project. Groundbreaking on the project took place in November 1998, and the project is scheduled to open to the public in July 2001.

In
November 2000, a limited liability company owned 50-50 with Boyd Gaming Corporation began construction of the Borgata, a 2,000-guestroom hotel-casino
resort, on a 27-acre portion of the Marina site. Boyd is overseeing the construction and will operate the resort upon completion. Construction is expected


to be completed in the summer of 2003 at a total project cost, including land, of approximately $1.04 billion. In December 2000, we contributed the 27 acres of land and Boyd contributed
$90 million in cash to the venture, and the venture obtained a $630 million secured bank credit facility, which is non-recourse to MGM MIRAGE, to fund the project costs. We
and Boyd are each required to contribute up to an additional $117 million in cash to the venture and Boyd is required to contribute any additional cash necessary to fund project costs in excess
of the agreed project budget. As of December 31, 2000, each partner had made $17 million of such additional cash contributions to the venture.

As
required by our agreement with Boyd, we have designed and are developing the common roads, landscaping and other master plan improvement for the entire Marina site. As part of the
agreement with the City, we are required to remediate environmental contamination at the Marina site, which was a municipal landfill for many years. A substantial portion of the remediation work has
been completed. As noted above, we have recently decided to proceed with the design and development of a new wholly owned hotel-casino resort on the Marina site next to the Borgata. The project is in
the preliminary design phase and no construction budget or schedule has been developed.

We
must apply for and receive numerous governmental permits and satisfy other conditions before construction of a new resort on the Marina site can begin. We cannot be certain of the
ultimate construction schedule or cost of construction of the Borgata or any other project on the Marina site.

On
August 5, 1999, we announced a 12-month stock repurchase program for up to 10 million shares of our common stock. We purchased a total of
3.1 million shares for an approximate cost of $66 million through February 2000. The repurchase program was suspended as a result of the Mirage acquisition and has now expired.

On
December 13, 1999, our Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of our common stock and declared an initial quarterly cash dividend of $0.10
per share, after giving effect to the stock split. The additional shares were distributed on February 25, 2000 to stockholders of record on February 10, 2000. The cash dividend totaling
approximately $11 million was paid on March 1, 2000 to stockholders of record on February 10, 2000. All references to share and per share data herein have been adjusted
retroactively to give effect to the stock split. Concurrently, the Board of Directors increased the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 75 million shares to 300 million
shares. As a result of the Mirage acquisition, we announced on April 19, 2000 that the previously declared quarterly dividend policy was discontinued.

Our
debt has increased substantially as a result of the Mirage acquisition. We intend to focus on utilizing available free cash flow to reduce indebtedness, as well as to finance our
ongoing operations. We expect to finance operations, capital expenditures and existing debt obligations through cash flow from operations, cash on hand, bank credit facilities and, depending on market
conditions, public offerings of securities under the shelf registration statement.

Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity
prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our long-term debt. To date, we have not invested in derivative or foreign currency based financial
instruments. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed-rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our
bank credit facilities.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards

We will adopt Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue 00-14, "Accounting for Certain Sales Incentives," in the first quarter of 2001. EITF
00-14 requires that sales incentives be recorded as a reduction of revenue. The adoption of EITF 00-14 will have no effect on our operating income or our


accounting for rooms, food and beverage and other non-casino revenues. We currently classify incentives to induce casino play as operating expenses. We will reclassify such incentives,
which totaled approximately $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2000, beginning in the first quarter of 2001, and will also reclassify prior period amounts.

Current
Report on Form 8-K/A, dated September 12, 2000, filed by the Company on October 4, 2000, in which events under Item 5, Other Events, and Item 7,
Financial Statements and Exhibits, were reported.


REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM MIRAGE

We
have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM MIRAGE (a Delaware corporation) and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the
related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998. These consolidated financial statements and the schedule
referred to below are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of MGM MIRAGE and subsidiaries as of
December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States.

Our
audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic financial statements taken as a whole. The financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts
for the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998 is presented for purposes of complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and is not a required part of the basic financial
statements. This schedule
has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in the audit of the basic financial statements and, in our opinion, fairly states in all material respects the financial data required to be set
forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole.

MGM MIRAGE AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — ORGANIZATION

MGM MIRAGE (the "Company"), formerly known as MGM Grand, Inc., is a Delaware corporation, incorporated on January 29, 1986. As of
December 31, 2000, approximately 59.7% of the outstanding shares of the Company's common stock were owned by Kirk Kerkorian or Tracinda Corporation ("Tracinda"), a Nevada corporation wholly
owned by Kirk Kerkorian.

On
May 31, 2000, the Company completed the acquisition (the "Mirage Acquisition") of Mirage Resorts, Incorporated ("Mirage") (see Note 3). Mirage, through wholly owned
subsidiaries, owns and operates the following hotel, casino and entertainment resorts: Bellagio, a European-style luxury resort; The Mirage, a tropically-themed destination resort; Treasure Island at
The Mirage, a pirate-themed hotel and casino resort; and the Holiday Inn® Casino Boardwalk, all of which are located on the Las Vegas Strip. Mirage also owns a 50% interest in the joint
venture that owns and operates the Monte Carlo Resort & Casino, a palatial-style hotel and casino also located on the Las Vegas Strip. Mirage also owns and operates the Golden Nugget, a hotel
and casino in downtown Las Vegas, the Golden Nugget-Laughlin, located in Laughlin, Nevada, and Beau Rivage, a beachfront resort located in Biloxi, Mississippi. The Company is developing the Borgata, a
hotel and casino resort on 27 acres in the Marina area of Atlantic City, New Jersey, in a limited liability company owned 50-50 with Boyd Gaming Corporation. The Company also owns
approximately 95 acres adjacent to the Borgata site available for future development. The aforementioned properties are collectively referred to herein as the "Mirage Properties."

Prior
to March 1, 1999, the Company and Primadonna Resorts, Inc. ("Primadonna") each owned 50% of New York-New York Hotel & Casino, LLC ("NYNY LLC").
On March 1, 1999, the Company completed its acquisition (the "Primadonna Acquisition") of Primadonna, and as part of the Primadonna Acquisition, acquired Primadonna's 50% ownership interest in
NYNY LLC, which owns and operates the New York-New York Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip (see Note 3). Consequently, as of March 1, 1999, Primadonna and NYNY LLC
became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. The Primadonna Acquisition also gave the Company ownership of three resorts located in Primm, Nevada
at the California/Nevada state line: Whiskey Pete's, Buffalo Bill's and the Primm Valley Resort (the "Primm Properties"), as well as two championship golf courses located near the Primm Properties.

Through
its wholly owned subsidiary, MGM Grand Hotel, LLC, the Company owns and operates the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino ("MGM Grand Las Vegas"), a hotel, casino and entertainment
complex located on the Las Vegas Strip.

The
Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, MGM Grand Detroit, Inc., and its local partners in Detroit, Michigan formed MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, to develop a hotel, casino
and entertainment complex ("MGM Grand Detroit"). The plans for MGM Grand Detroit call for an 800-room hotel, a 100,000 square-foot casino, signature restaurants and retail
outlets, a showroom and other entertainment venues. On July 28, 1999, the Michigan Gaming Control Board issued a casino license to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC to conduct gaming operations in its
interim facility ("MGM Grand Detroit Casino"), which commenced operations on July 29, 1999. The MGM Grand Detroit Casino is located directly off of the John C. Lodge Expressway in downtown
Detroit.

Through
its wholly owned subsidiary, MGM Grand Australia Pty Ltd., the Company owns and operates the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Darwin, Australia ("MGM Grand Australia"),
which is located on 18 acres of beachfront property on the north central coast of Australia.

Through
its wholly owned subsidiary, MGM Grand South Africa, Inc., the Company manages two permanent casinos and one interim casino in two provinces of the Republic of South
Africa. The Company managed an interim facility in Nelspruit from October 15, 1997 to November 17, 1999, at which time a


permanent casino began operations and the temporary operations ceased. The interim casino in Witbank began operations on March 10, 1998, and the interim casino in Johannesburg operated from
September 28, 1998 through November 26, 2000, at which time the permanent facility, the Montecasino, began operations and the temporary operations ceased. The Company receives management
fees from its partner, Tsogo Sun Gaming & Entertainment ("Tsogo Sun"), which is responsible for providing all project costs. Tsogo Sun has been granted additional licenses for Durban and East
London, and the Company anticipates interim casinos will be opened in those locations in 2001.

NOTE 2 — SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Principles of consolidation.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are 50% or less owned are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.

Management's use of estimates.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles Those principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash equivalents consist of investments in bank certificates of deposit and other
interest bearing instruments with initial maturities of three months or less. Such investments are carried at cost which approximates market value.

Concentrations of credit risk.

Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit
risk consist principally of short-term investments and receivables.

The
Company's short-term investments typically consist of high-grade commercial paper as well as U.S. Government-backed repurchase agreements. Such investments
are made with financial institutions having a high credit quality and the Company limits the amount of its credit exposure to any one financial institution. Due to the short-term nature of
the instruments, the Company does not take possession of the securities, which are instead held in a custodial account.

The
Company extends credit to approved casino customers following background checks and investigations of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2000, a substantial portion of the
Company's receivables was due from customers residing in foreign countries. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectibility of such
receivables.

An
estimated allowance for doubtful accounts and discounts is maintained to reduce the Company's receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. Management
believes that as of December 31, 2000, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had not already been determined and recorded.

Inventories.

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined by the first-in,
first-out method.

Property and equipment.

Property and equipment are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add
to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the determination


of income. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:

Buildings and improvements

15 to 40 years

Equipment, furniture and fixtures

3 to 7 years

Land improvements

10 to 15 years

Leasehold improvement

5 to 20 years

Capital
leases are depreciated over the estimated useful life of the assets or the life of the lease, whichever is shorter.

Excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired.

The excess of purchase price over fair market
value of net assets acquired is amortized on a straight-line basis over 40 years.

Casino revenues and promotional allowances.

Casino revenue is the aggregate net difference between gaming wins and
losses. The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other services furnished to hotel-casino guests without charge is included in gross revenue and then deducted as promotional
allowances. The estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances was primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

In
the fourth quarter of 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") of the Financial Accounting Standards Board reached a consensus on Issue 00-14, "Accounting for
Certain Sales Incentives." EITF 00-14 requires that sales incentives be recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company's existing policy related to rooms, food and beverage and other
non-casino revenues complies with EITF 00-14. In accordance with the transition rules of EITF 00-14, the Company will adopt EITF 00-14 in the first
quarter of 2001 as it relates to incentives to induce casino play, which are currently classified as operating expenses. The amount of such incentives for the year ended December 31, 2000 was
approximately $85 million. The adoption of EITF 00-14 will have no effect on the Company's operating income.

Currency translation.

The Company accounts for currency translation in accordance with Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation." The Australian results of operations and the balance sheet are translated from Australian dollars to U.S. dollars. Balance sheet
accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each year-end. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation
adjustments resulting from this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income (loss).

Capitalized interest.

The interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and
included in the cost of the project. When no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost of the Company's
outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.

Corporate expense.

Corporate expense represents unallocated payroll and aircraft costs, professional fees and various
other expenses not directly related to the Company's hotel-casino operations. In addition, corporate expense includes the costs associated with the Company's evaluation and pursuit of new business


opportunities, which are expensed as incurred until development of a specific project has become relatively certain.

Income per share of common stock.

The weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares used in the
calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share consisted of the following:

Year Ended December 31,




(In thousands)

Weighted-average common shares outstanding (used in the calculation of basic earnings per share)

1,328

Weighted-average common and common equivalent shares (used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share)

147,901

120,086

112,684

Reclassification.

The consolidated financial statements for prior years reflect certain reclassifications to conform
with the current year presentation, which have no effect on previously reported net income. In addition, the accompanying financial statements reflect certain adjustments to amounts related to other
comprehensive income. The adjustments reduce previously reported comprehensive income by $3 million for 1998 and increase previously reported comprehensive income by $6 million for 1999,
but have no effect on previously reported net income.

Change in accounting principle.

Effective January 1, 1999, the Company adopted Statement of Position
98-5 ("SOP 98-5"), "Reporting on the Costs of Start-up Activities." SOP 98-5 requires that all companies expense costs of start-up
activities as those costs are incurred. The term "start-up" includes pre-opening, pre-operating and organization activities. As a result of the adoption of SOP
98-5, in 1999 the Company recognized a cumulative effect of the accounting change (net of tax) of $8 million, relating principally to its development project in Detroit.

NOTE 3 — ACQUISITIONS

On May 31, 2000, the Company completed the Mirage Acquisition whereby Mirage shareholders received $21 per share in cash. The acquisition had a total
equity value of approximately $4.4 billion. In addition, the Company assumed approximately $2.0 billion of Mirage's outstanding debt, of which approximately $1.0 billion was
refinanced and $950 million remains outstanding. The transaction was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the underlying assets
acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. The estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed (net of the debt refinanced
at the time of the acquisition) were $8.1 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. The operating results for Mirage are included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of
acquisition.

On
March 1, 1999, the Company completed the Primadonna Acquisition for approximately 19 million shares of the Company's common stock valued at approximately
$244 million plus the assumption of debt totaling $315 million. Primadonna shareholders received .66 share of the Company's common stock for every Primadonna share held. The transaction
was accounted for as a purchase and, accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the
Primadonna Acquisition. The estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were $742 million and $498 million, respectively. The operating results for Primadonna are
included in the Consolidated Statements of Income from the date of acquisition.

Total
interest incurred during 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $364 million, $76 million and $40 million, respectively, of which $91 million,
$16 million and $15 million, respectively, was capitalized.

On
April 11, 2000, the Company entered into three senior credit agreements providing for bank financing totaling $4.3 billion from syndicates of banks each led by Bank
of America, N.A. (collectively, the "New Senior Facilities"). The New Senior Facilities consist of (1) a $2.0 billion senior revolving credit facility which matures on May 31,
2005 (the "$2.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility") which amended, extended and increased a $1.25 billion facility; (2) a $1.0 billion senior revolving credit facility
which matures on April 6, 2001 (the "$1.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility"); and (3) a $1.3 billion senior term loan which matures on April 6, 2001 (the
"$1.3 billion Term Loan"). Interest on the New Senior Facilities is based on the bank reference rate or Eurodollar rate. As of December 31, 2000, the Company's borrowing rate was
approximately 7.8%. The Company's borrowing rate under the predecessor $1.25 billion facility as of December 31, 1999 was approximately 6.8%. The New Senior Facilities contain certain
covenants, including the requirement to maintain certain financial ratios. On May 31, 2000, the Company borrowed $4.21 billion under the New Senior Facilities to fund the Mirage
Acquisition, refinance certain indebtedness of Mirage and the Company, pay fees and expenses in connection with the Mirage Acquisition and for general corporate purposes. On September 15, 2000,
the Company used the proceeds from the issuance of senior notes to repay $839 million of the $1.3 billion Term Loan. In January 2001, an additional $395 million of the
$1.3 billion Term Loan was repaid using the proceeds of a senior subordinated note offering. The Company intends to refinance the remaining balances of the $1.3 billion Term Loan and the
$1.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility prior to or upon maturity through the amendment and renewal of the New Senior Facilities or through other financing alternatives. The Company had
borrowing capacity at December 31, 2000 under the $2.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility that could be used to refinance a portion of the remaining balances. Stand-by letters
of credit totaling $55 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2000 under the $2.0 billion Revolving Credit Facility, principally to support municipal financing used in
connection with the proposed MGM Grand Detroit permanent casino.

On
May 5, 2000, the Company's shelf registration statement, which allows the Company to issue a total of up to $2.75 billion of debt and equity securities from time to
time in public offerings, was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. On May 31, 2000, the Company issued under the shelf registration statement $710 million of
senior subordinated notes, which carry a coupon of 9.75% and are due on June 1, 2007. These senior subordinated notes contain certain basic covenants consistent with this type of indenture.
Proceeds from this offering were used to repay a portion of the then outstanding borrowings under Mirage's senior credit facility. On September 15, 2000, the Company issued under the shelf
registration statement $850 million of senior notes, which carry a coupon of 8.50% and are due on September 15, 2010. These senior notes contain covenants consistent with the Company's
other senior notes. On January 23, 2001, the Company issued under the shelf registration statement $400 million of senior subordinated notes, which carry a coupon of 8.375% and are due
on February 1, 2011. These senior subordinated notes contain covenants consistent with the Company's other senior subordinated notes. Proceeds from the September 2000 and
January 2001 offerings were used to repay a portion of the $1.3 billion Term Loan as discussed above. Any future public offering of
securities under the shelf registration statement will only be made by means of a prospectus supplement.

On
May 31, 2000, the $300 million 6.95% Senior Notes due 2005 and the $200 million 6.875% Senior Notes due 2008 each received investment grade ratings from both
Moody's and Standard & Poor's. As a result, concurrently with the Mirage Acquisition, the collateral previously securing these obligations was released. The senior notes are

pari passu

with the
New Senior Facilities and contain various restrictive covenants, in general similar to the New Senior Facilities.

In
connection with the Mirage Acquisition, all of the outstanding Mirage senior notes and debentures became obligations of the Company. The notes and debentures are in various
tranches as follows: (1) $200 million 6.625% senior notes due February 2005; (2) $250 million 7.25% senior notes due October 2006;
(3) $200 million 6.75% senior notes due August 2007; (4) $200 million 6.75% senior notes


due February 2008; and (5) $100 million 7.25% senior debentures due August 2017 (collectively, the "Mirage Notes").

The
Company and each of its material subsidiaries, including Mirage but excluding MGM Grand Detroit, LLC, are directly liable for or unconditionally guarantee the New Senior
Facilities, the senior notes, the Mirage Notes and the senior subordinated notes. MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is a guarantor under the New Senior Facilities, but only to the extent that the proceeds of
borrowings under such facilities are made available to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC. As of December 31, 2000, the Company was in compliance with all covenant provisions associated with the
aforementioned obligations.

due in 2001 which the Company has refinanced on a long-term basis or for which borrowing capacity was available under the $2.0 billion Revolving Credit

The
estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt at December 31, 2000 was approximately $6.01 billion, versus its book value of approximately
$5.87 billion. At December 31, 1999, the estimated fair value of the Company's long-term debt was approximately $1.27 billion, versus its book value of approximately
$1.31 billion. The estimated fair value of the Company's public debt securities was based on quoted market prices on or about December 31, 2000 and 1999. The estimated fair value of the
Company's outstanding credit facility borrowings was assumed to approximate book value due to the short-term nature of the borrowings.

NOTE 8 — COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases.

The Company leases real estate and various equipment under operating and, to a lesser extent, capital lease
arrangements. Certain real estate leases provide for escalation of rent based upon a specified price index and/or based upon periodic appraisals.


At December 31, 2000, the Company was obligated under non-cancelable operating leases and capital leases to make future minimum lease payments as follows:

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to
its business. Management does not believe that the outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.

NOTE 9 — STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY

On June 23, 1998, the Company announced a $17.50 per share cash tender offer for up to 12 million shares of Company common stock as part of a
24 million share repurchase program. The offer commenced on July 2, 1998 and expired on July 31, 1998. Based upon final results, 21.6 million shares of the Company's common
stock were tendered, and accordingly, the shares were prorated. The total acquisition cost of the 12 million shares was approximately $211 million.

On
March 1, 1999, the Company issued approximately 19 million shares of the Company's common stock valued at approximately $244 million in connection with the
Primadonna Acquisition.

On
June 10, 1999, the Company announced a $25.00 per share tender offer for up to 12 million shares of the Company's common stock. The offer commenced on June 17,
1999 and expired on July 23, 1999. Based upon the final results, 30.2 million shares of the Company's common stock were tendered, and accordingly, the shares were prorated. The total
acquisition cost of the 12 million shares was approximately $282 million. The Company recognized certain non-recurring compensation costs totaling approximately
$19 million related to exercisable options that were tendered. This tender offer completed the acquisition of the remaining 12 million shares in the 24 million share repurchase
program announced on June 23, 1998.

On
August 5, 1999, the Company announced a 12-month stock repurchase program for up to 10 million shares of the Company's common stock. The Company purchased
a total of 3.1 million shares for an approximate cost of $66 million through February 2000. The repurchase program was suspended as a result of the Mirage Acquisition and has now
expired.

On
December 13, 1999, the Board of Directors approved a two-for-one split of the Company's common stock and declared an initial quarterly cash dividend
of $0.10 per share, after giving effect to the


stock split. The additional shares were distributed on February 25, 2000 to stockholders of record on February 10, 2000. All references to share and per share data herein have been
adjusted retroactively to give effect to the stock split. Concurrently, the Board of Directors increased the number of authorized shares of the Company's common stock from 75 million shares to
300 million shares. As a result of the Mirage Acquisition, the Company announced on April 19, 2000 that the previously declared quarterly dividend policy was discontinued.

On
April 18, 2000, the Company completed a private placement of 46.5 million shares of the Company's common stock for a total purchase price of $1.23 billion. On
May 18, 2000, as required by the private placement agreement, the Company filed a shelf registration statement to register the resale of these shares. Tracinda purchased 23 million
shares in the private placement.

NOTE 10 — STOCK OPTION PLANS

The Company has adopted nonqualified stock option plans and incentive stock option plans which provide for the granting of stock options to eligible directors,
officers and employees. As of December 31, 2000, the aggregate number of shares subject to options available for grant under all of the plans was 2.6 million.

The
plans are administered by the Compensation and Stock Option Committee of the Board of Directors. Salaried officers, directors and other key employees of the Company and its
subsidiaries are eligible to receive options. The exercise price in each instance is 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The options have
10-year terms and in most cases are exercisable in either four or five equal annual installments.

On
June 22, 1998, the Compensation and Stock Option Committee approved an offer to employees to reprice their out-of-the-money options
(covering an aggregate of 3,641,900 shares). The original options had exercise prices ranging from $16.59 to $22.06, and the new options have an exercise price of $13.31. For holders who accepted the
repricing, certain conditions were imposed, including: (1) commencement of a new holding period for vesting of options (whether or not the initial options had vested) and (2) a
one-year extension of employment contracts, at the Company's option, where applicable. The repricing offer was not made to the Company's outside directors.

A

The
fair value of each option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions used for grants in
2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively: risk-free interest rates of 6% for all years; no expected dividend yields for the years presented; expected lives of 5, 8 and 6 years,
respectively; and expected volatility of 38%, 36% and 36%, respectively. The estimated weighted average fair value of options granted in 2000, 1999 and 1998 was $13.25, $11.15 and $6.81, respectively.

NOTE 11 — EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

Employees of the Company who are members of various unions are covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained, multi-employer health and welfare and
defined benefit pension plans. The Company recorded an expense of $38 million in 2000, $5 million in 1999 and $1 million in 1998 under such plans. The plans' sponsors have not
provided sufficient information to permit the Company to determine its share of unfunded vested benefits, if any.


The Company has various retirement savings plans under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code covering its non-union employees. The plans allow employees to
defer, within prescribed limits, up to 15% of their income on a pre-tax basis through contributions to the plans. The Company matches, within prescribed limits, a portion of eligible
employees' contributions. The Company recorded charges for matching contributions of $12 million in 2000, $6 million in 1999 and $4 million in 1998.

The
Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan. The plan provides eligible employees the opportunity to purchase shares of the Company's common stock via payroll deductions.
The price for each share of common stock is the weighted average price paid for all the shares purchased by the plan administrator on behalf of the participating employees on the last trading day of
each month. The Company pays the administrative costs of the plan. The plan may be amended or terminated at any time by the Board of Directors or by a committee designated by the Board of Directors.

The
Company and MGM Grand Las Vegas maintain a nonqualified deferred retirement plan for certain key employees. The plan allows participants to defer, on a pre-tax basis,
a portion of their salary and bonus and accumulate tax deferred earnings, plus investment earnings on the deferred balances, as a retirement fund. All deferred amounts vest immediately. There are no
employer matching contributions made under this plan.

The
Company implemented a second nonqualified deferred retirement plan in December 2000 which commenced on January 1, 2001 for certain key employees. The plan allows
participants to defer, on a pre-tax basis, a portion of their salary and bonus and accumulate tax deferred earnings, plus investment earnings on the deferred balances, as a retirement
fund. Participants receive a Company match of up to 4% of salary, net of any Company match received under the Company's 401(k) plans. All employee deferrals vest immediately. The Company matching
contributions vest ratably over a three-year period.

The
Company implemented a supplemental executive retirement plan (the "SERP") in December 2000 which commenced on January 1, 2001 for certain key employees. The SERP is
a nonqualified plan under which the Company makes quarterly contributions which are intended to provide a retirement benefit that is a fixed percentage of a participant's estimated final
five-year average annual salary, up to a maximum of 65%. Company contributions and investment earnings on the contributions are tax-deferred and accumulate as a retirement
fund. Employees do not make contributions under this plan. A portion of the Company contributions and investment earnings thereon vests after three years of SERP participation and the remaining
portion vests after both five years of SERP participation and 10 years of continuous service.

NOTE 12 — INCOME TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes according to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes"
("SFAS 109"). SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences. The
standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied. At December 31, 2000,
the Company believes that it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets are fully realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and future projected
taxable income. Accordingly, there is no valuation allowance at December 31, 2000.

The
Company acquired Mirage on May 31, 2000 through a stock merger. The respective deferred tax assets and liabilities of Mirage have been consolidated with the MGM MIRAGE
deferred balances, and are reflected in the December 31, 2000 deferred tax assets and liabilities below.

For
U.S. federal income tax return purposes, the Company has a net operating loss carryforward of $115 million, which will expire in 2019, an alternative minimum tax credit
carryforward of $58 million, which does not expire, and a general business tax credit carryforward of $7 million, which expires in different periods through 2020.

Undistributed
earnings of the Company's foreign subsidiaries amounted to $7 million at December 31, 2000. Those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in
the operations of the foreign subsidiaries and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal or state income taxes has been provided thereon in accordance with APB Opinion 23.

NOTE 13 — COMPANY RESTRUCTURING PLANS

During the three months ended March 31, 2000, management initiated and completed a restructuring plan designed to consolidate certain general and
administrative functions at New York-New York and MGM Grand Las Vegas. This restructuring resulted in a one-time charge against earnings in the first quarter of 2000 totaling
$6 million ($4 million, net of income tax). Approximately 70 people were affected by the reductions, primarily at the Company's operating properties (excluding the Mirage Properties).

In
connection with the Mirage Acquisition, management initiated a comprehensive restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve efficiencies of the combined operations of the
Company. This restructuring resulted in a one-time charge against earnings in the second quarter of 2000 totaling $18 million ($12 million, net of income tax), primarily
related to the accrual of costs associated with contract terminations and staffing reductions of approximately $6 million, the buyout of various leases of approximately $11 million and
other related restructuring costs of $1 million. Approximately 125 people were affected by the reductions, primarily at the Company's operating properties (excluding the Mirage Properties)
relating to duplicative functions within marketing, entertainment, retail, information systems and human resources.

Approximately
$9 million of payments were applied against the restructuring accruals during 2000, leaving a remaining unpaid balance of $15 million as of
December 31, 2000. The remaining balance relates principally to the lease buyouts discussed above.

NOTE 14 — ASSET WRITE-DOWNS AND IMPAIRMENTS

During June 2000, the Company recognized a charge against earnings of $102 million ($66 million, net of tax) related to certain projects
previously under development which management has determined not to pursue ($49 million), the divesting of certain non-strategic assets ($19 million) and the
re-evaluation of certain other assets ($34 million), all as a result of the Mirage acquisition.


NOTE 15 — CONSOLIDATING CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

The Company's subsidiaries (excluding MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and certain minor subsidiaries) have fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a joint and several
basis, payment of the New Senior Facilities, the senior notes, the Mirage Notes, and the senior subordinated notes. Separate condensed financial statement information for the subsidiary guarantors and
non-guarantors for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999 is as follows (information for the year ended December 31, 1998 is not presented since all
