PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

MGM MIRAGE is referred to as the “Company” or the
    “Registrant,” and together with our subsidiaries may
    also be referred to as “we,” “us” or
    “our.”

Liquidity
    and Financial Position

For discussion of our liquidity and financial position, please
    see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
    Condition and Results of Operations — Executive
    Overview — Liquidity and Financial Position” and
    Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial
    statements.

Overview

MGM MIRAGE is one of the world’s leading development
    companies with significant gaming and resort operations. We
    believe the resorts we own, manage, and invest in are among the
    world’s finest casino resorts. MGM MIRAGE was organized as
    MGM Grand, Inc. on January 29, 1986 and is a Delaware
    corporation. MGM MIRAGE acts largely as a holding company and
    its operations are conducted through its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries.

Our strategy is based on developing and maintaining competitive
    advantages in the following areas:

•

Developing and maintaining a strong portfolio of resorts;

•

Operating our resorts to ensure excellent customer service and
    maximize revenue and profit;

•

Executing a sustainable growth strategy;

•

Leveraging our brand and management assets.

Resort
    Portfolio

We execute our strategy through a portfolio approach, seeking to
    ensure that we own, invest in and manage resorts in each market
    segment that are superior to our competitors’ resorts. We
    also seek to own and invest in superior real estate assets, with
    a blend of developing these assets on our own, partnering with
    others, and strategically buying and selling real estate.

Our approach to resort ownership and investment is based on
    operating the premier resorts in each geographic market and each
    customer segment in which we operate. We discuss customer
    segments in the “Resort Operation” section. Regarding
    our approach to resort locations, we feel it is important to
    selectively operate in markets with stable regulatory
    environments. As seen in the table below, this means that a
    large portion of our resorts are located in Nevada. In addition,
    we target markets with growth potential. We also believe there
    is growth potential in investing in and managing non-gaming
    resorts. See the “Sustainable Growth” and
    “Leveraging Our Brand and Management Assets” sections
    for further details on these initiatives.

Investing
    in Existing Resorts

We believe that ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in
    their respective markets requires significant capital
    investment. We have a track record of reinvesting cash flows
    into our existing resorts and we have achieved strong returns on
    these investments in the past. We have made significant
    investments in our resorts over the past few years, we do not
    expect to reinvest significantly in our resorts in 2009 or 2010.

For instance, between 2003 and 2006 we invested a significant
    amount of capital at MGM Grand Las Vegas, with additions such as

KÁ,

the acclaimed show by Cirque du Soleil; the
    Skylofts and West Wing room enhancements; two highly acclaimed
    restaurants by Joël Robuchon; and new poker and race and
    sports areas. That resort



earned $290 million of operating income in 2007, a dramatic
    increase from the $127 million earned in 2002. Similarly,
    we transformed The Mirage, a resort many market observers credit
    with changing the face of the Las Vegas Strip. We felt strongly
    about the allure of the resort, but also believed that customers
    need fresh, updated experiences. Therefore, we invested
    significant capital at The Mirage between 2004 and 2006, adding
    several new restaurants; a category-defining nightclub,

Jet

; upgraded high-limit gaming areas; and the
    Beatles-themed

Love

show by Cirque du Soleil. The Mirage
    earned $108 million of operating income in 2003; in 2007,
    The Mirage earned $173 million of operating income.

Capital additions have not had the same impact on profitability
    due to the severe downturn in economic conditions in general and
    the impact on tourism and travel spending
    specifically — see “Management’s Discussion
    and Analysis.” For instance, we invested in new amenities
    and remodeled the standard rooms at Mandalay Bay in 2007, but
    operating income did not rise appreciably in 2008. However, we
    believe these improvements, and improvements at other resorts
    such as Luxor and New York-New York, still increase our relative
    market position during times where we and our competitors are
    trying to draw from a smaller customer base. In addition, we
    believe such investments will allow us to earn an
    above — market return when economic conditions improve.

We also actively manage our portfolio of land holdings. We own
    approximately 700 acres of land on the Las Vegas Strip,
    with a meaningful portion of those acres undeveloped or
    considered by us to be under-developed.

Risks
    Associated with Our Portfolio Strategy

The principal risk factors relating to our current portfolio of
    resorts are:

•

Our limited geographic diversification — our major
    resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip and some of our
    largest competitors operate in more gaming markets than we do;

•

There are a number of gaming facilities located closer to where
    our customers live than our resorts;

•

Additional new hotel-casinos and expansion projects at existing
    Las Vegas hotel-casinos are under construction or have been
    proposed. We are unable to determine to what extent increased
    competition will affect our future operating results.

Resort
    Operation

Our operating philosophy is predicated on creating resorts of
    memorable character, treating our employees well and providing
    superior service for our guests. We also seek to develop
    competitive advantages in specific markets and among specific
    customer groups.

General

We primarily own and operate casino resorts, which includes
    offering gaming, hotel, dining, entertainment, retail and other
    resort amenities. Over half of our net revenue is derived from
    non-gaming activities, a higher percentage than many of our
    competitors, as our operating philosophy is to provide a
    complete resort experience for our guests, including non-gaming
    amenities which command a premium price based on their quality.

As a resort-based company, our operating results are highly
    dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in
    turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and
    other amenities. Since we believe that the number of walk-in
    customers affects the success of our casino resorts, we design
    our facilities to maximize their attraction to guests of other
    hotels. We also generate a significant portion of our operating
    income from the high-end gaming segment, which can cause
    variability in our results.

Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers
    wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash
    or credit cards. Our resorts, like many in the industry,
    generate significant operating cash flow. Our industry is
    capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our
    resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing,
    fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash
    for future development.



Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature,
    though a variety of factors can affect the results of any
    interim period, including the timing of major Las Vegas
    conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special
    events for our high-end customers, and the level of play during
    major holidays, including New Year and Chinese New Year. Our
    significant convention and meeting facilities allow us to
    maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes during off-peak
    times such as mid-week or during traditionally slower leisure
    travel periods, which also leads to better labor utilization.
    Our results do not depend on key individual customers, though
    our success in marketing to customer groups — such as
    convention customers — or the financial health of
    customer segments — such as business travelers or
    high-end gaming customers from a particular country or
    region — can impact our results.

All of our casino resorts operate 24 hours a day, every day
    of the year, with the exception of Grand Victoria which operates
    22 hours a day, every day of the year. At our wholly-owned
    resorts, our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and
    managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated
    by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or
    leased to third parties. We generally have an operating
    philosophy that prefers ownership of amenities, since guests
    have direct contact with staff in these areas and we prefer to
    control all aspects of the guest experience. However, we do
    lease space to retail and food and beverage operators in certain
    situations, particularly for branding opportunities. We also
    operate many “managed” outlets, utilizing third party
    management for specific expertise in areas such as restaurants
    and nightclubs, as well as for branding opportunities.

Customers
    and Competition

Our casino resorts generally operate in highly competitive
    environments. We compete against other gaming companies as well
    as other hospitality and leisure and business travel companies.
    Our primary methods of competing successfully include:

•

Locating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel
    markets, and operating at superior sites within those markets;

•

Constructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and
    facilities, including luxurious guestrooms along with premier
    dining, entertainment and retail amenities;

•

Recruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated
    employees who provide superior and friendly customer service;

•

Providing unique, “must-see” entertainment
    attractions; and

•

Developing distinctive and memorable marketing and promotional
    programs.

Our Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large
    number of other hotel-casinos in the Las Vegas area, including
    major hotel-casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major
    hotel-casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles
    from the center of the Strip, and several major facilities
    elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip resorts
    also compete, in part, with each other. According to the Las
    Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, there were
    approximately 141,000 guestrooms in Las Vegas at
    December 31, 2008, up 6% from approximately 133,000 rooms
    at December 31, 2007. Las Vegas visitor volume was
    37.5 million in 2008, a decrease of 4% from the
    39.2 million reported for 2007.

The principal segments of the Las Vegas gaming market are
    leisure travel; premium gaming customers; conventions, including
    small meetings, trade associations, and corporate incentive
    programs; and tour and travel. Our high-end properties, which
    include Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, and The
    Mirage, appeal to the upper end of each market segment,
    balancing their business by using the convention and tour and
    travel segments to fill the mid-week and off-peak periods. Our
    marketing strategy for TI, New York-New York, Luxor and Monte
    Carlo is aimed at attracting middle- to upper-middle-income
    wagerers, largely from the leisure travel and, to a lesser
    extent, the tour and travel segments. Excalibur and Circus
    Circus Las Vegas generally cater to the value-oriented and
    middle-income leisure travel and tour and travel segments.

Outside Las Vegas, our other wholly-owned Nevada operations
    compete with each other and with many other similar sized and
    larger operations. A significant portion of our customers at
    these resorts come from California. We believe the expansion of
    Native American gaming has had a negative impact on all of our
    Nevada resorts not located



on the Las Vegas Strip, and additional expansion in California
    could have a further adverse effect on these resorts. Our Nevada
    resorts not located in Las Vegas appeal primarily to the
    value-oriented leisure traveler and the value-oriented local
    customer.

Outside Nevada, our wholly-owned resorts mainly compete for
    customers in local gaming markets, where location is a critical
    factor to success. In Tunica, Mississippi, one of our
    competitors is closer to Memphis, the area’s principal
    market. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in
    surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each
    region. For instance, in Detroit, Michigan we also compete with
    a casino in nearby Windsor, Canada and with Native American
    casinos in Michigan. In Biloxi, Mississippi we also compete with
    regional riverboat and land-based casinos in Louisiana, Native
    American casinos in central Mississippi, the Florida market, and
    with casinos in the Bahamas.

Our unconsolidated affiliates mainly compete for customers
    against casino resorts in their respective markets. Much like
    our wholly-owned resorts, our unconsolidated affiliates compete
    through the quality of amenities, the value of the experience
    offered to guests, and the location of their resorts.

Our casino resorts also compete for customers with hotel-casino
    operations located in other areas of the United States and other
    parts of the world, and for leisure and business travelers with
    non-gaming tourist destinations such as Hawaii, Florida and
    cruise ships. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent
    with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card
    parlors, and other forms of legalized gaming in the United
    States.

Marketing

We advertise on radio, television and billboards and in
    newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the
    United States and overseas, as well as on the Internet and by
    direct mail. We also advertise through our regional marketing
    offices located in major United States and foreign cities. A key
    element of marketing to premium gaming customers is personal
    contact by our marketing personnel. Direct marketing is also
    important in the convention segment. We maintain Internet
    websites which inform customers about our resorts and allow our
    customers to reserve hotel rooms, make restaurant reservations
    and purchase show tickets. We also operate call centers to allow
    customer contact by phone to make hotel and restaurant
    reservations and purchase show tickets.

We utilize our world-class golf courses in marketing programs at
    our Las Vegas Strip resorts. Our major Las Vegas resorts offer
    luxury suite packages that include golf privileges at Shadow
    Creek. In connection with our marketing activities, we also
    invite our premium gaming customers to play Shadow Creek on a
    complimentary basis. Additionally, marketing efforts at Beau
    Rivage benefit from the Fallen Oak golf course just 20 minutes
    north of Beau Rivage.

Employees
    and Management

We believe that knowledgeable, friendly and dedicated employees
    are a key success factor in the casino resort industry.
    Therefore, we invest heavily in recruiting, training and
    retaining our employees, as well as seeking to hire and promote
    the strongest management team possible. We have numerous
    programs, both at the corporate and business unit level,
    designed to achieve these objectives. For example, our diversity
    program extends throughout our Company, and focuses on the
    unique strengths of our individuals combined with a culture of
    working together to achieve greater performance. Our diversity
    program has been widely recognized, including the honor of
    “Top 50 Best Companies for Diversity” given by
    DiversityInc magazine. We have also invested heavily in
    training, and we believe our programs, such as the MGM Grand
    University and various leadership and management training
    programs, are

best-in-class

among our industry peers.

Technology

We utilize technology to maximize revenue and efficiency in our
    operations. Our Players Club program links our major resorts,
    and consolidates all slots and table games activity for
    customers with a Players Club account. Customers qualify for
    benefits across all of the participating resorts, regardless of
    where they play. We believe that our Players Club enables us to
    more effectively market to our customers. A large number of the
    slot machines at our



resorts operate with International Game Technology’s
    EZ-Pay

tm

cashless gaming system. We believe that this system enhances the
    customer experience and increases the revenue potential of our
    slot machines.

Technology is an important part of our strategy in non-gaming
    and administrative operations as well. Our hotel systems include
    yield management modules which allow us to maximize occupancy
    and room rates. Additionally, these systems capture charges made
    by our customers during their stay, including allowing customers
    of our resorts to charge meals and services at certain other MGM
    MIRAGE resorts to their hotel accounts. We implemented a new
    hotel management system at most of our major resorts in 2007,
    which has enhanced our guest service and improved our yield
    management capabilities across our portfolio of resorts.

Internal
    Controls

We have a strong culture of compliance, driven by our history in
    the highly regulated gaming industry and our belief that
    compliance is a value-added activity. Our system of internal
    controls and procedures — including internal control
    over financial reporting — is designed to ensure
    reliable and accurate financial records, transparent
    disclosures, compliance with laws and regulations, and
    protection of our assets. Our internal controls start at the
    source of business transactions, and we have rigorous
    enforcement through controllership at both the business unit and
    corporate level. Our corporate management also review each of
    our businesses on a regular basis and we have a corporate
    internal audit function that performs reviews around gaming
    compliance, internal controls over financial reporting, and
    operational areas.

In connection with the supervision of gaming activities at our
    casinos, we maintain stringent controls on the recording of all
    receipts and disbursements and other activities, such as cash
    transaction reporting. These controls include:

•

Locked cash boxes on the casino floor;

•

Daily cash counts performed by employees who are independent of
    casino operations;

•

Constant observation and supervision of the gaming area;

•

Observation and recording of gaming and other areas by
    closed-circuit television;

•

Constant computer monitoring of our slot machines; and

•

Timely analysis of deviations from expected performance.

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games
    volume at Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and The
    Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the
    same extent, although we offer markers to customers at certain
    of those casinos as well. We maintain strict controls over the
    issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from
    those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely.
    These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large
    corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts,
    including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices,
    personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and
    civil litigation.

In Nevada, Mississippi, Michigan, and Illinois, amounts owed for
    markers which are not timely paid are enforceable under state
    laws. All other states are required to enforce a judgment for
    amounts owed for markers entered into in Nevada, Mississippi,
    Illinois or Michigan which are not timely paid, pursuant to the
    Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution.
    Amounts owed for markers which are not timely paid are not
    legally enforceable in some foreign countries, but the United
    States assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy
    judgments entered in the United States.

Risks
    Associated With Our Operating Strategy

The principal risk factors relating to our operating strategy
    are:

•

Our guestroom, dining and entertainment prices are often higher
    than those of most of our competitors in each market, although
    we believe that the quality of our facilities and services is
    also higher;



•

Our hotel-casinos compete to some extent with each other for
    customers. Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and The
    Mirage, in particular, compete for some of the same premium
    gaming customers; MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay also
    compete to some extent against each other in the large-scale
    conference and convention business; and

•

Additional new hotel-casinos and expansion projects at existing
    Las Vegas hotel-casinos are under construction or have been
    proposed. We are unable to determine to what extent increased
    competition will affect our future operating results.

Sustainable
    Growth

In allocating capital, our financial strategy is focused on
    managing a proper mix of investing in existing resorts, spending
    on new resorts or initiatives, repaying long-term debt, and
    returning capital to shareholders. We have actively allocated
    capital to each of these areas historically. We believe there
    are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives
    that will provide returns in excess of the other options, though
    the pace and extent of such investments have been impacted by
    the current state of credit markets.

The following sections discuss certain of our current and
    potential development opportunities. We regularly evaluate
    possible expansion and acquisition opportunities in both the
    domestic and international markets, but cannot determine the
    likelihood of proceeding with specific development
    opportunities. Opportunities we evaluate may include the
    ownership, management and operation of gaming and other
    entertainment facilities in Nevada or in states other than
    Nevada or outside of the United States. We may undertake these
    opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more
    third parties.

CityCenter

We own 50% of CityCenter, currently under development on a

67-acre

site
    on the Las Vegas Strip, between Bellagio and Monte Carlo.
    Infinity World Development Corp. (“Infinity World”), a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab
    Emirates government decree entity, owns the other 50% of
    CityCenter. CityCenter will feature a 4,000-room casino resort
    designed by world-famous architect Cesar Pelli; two 400-room
    non-gaming boutique hotels, one of which will be managed by
    luxury hotelier Mandarin Oriental; approximately
    425,000 square feet of retail shops, dining and
    entertainment venues; and approximately 2.1 million square
    feet of residential space in approximately 2,400 luxury
    condominium and condominium-hotel units in multiple towers.
    CityCenter is expected to open in late 2009, except CityCenter
    postponed the opening of The Harmon Hotel & Spa until
    late 2010 and cancelled the development of approximately 200
    residential units originally planned. We are serving as the
    developer of CityCenter and, upon completion of construction, we
    will manage CityCenter for a fee.

Atlantic
    City, New Jersey

We own approximately 130 acres on Renaissance Pointe in
    Atlantic City, New Jersey. We lease ten acres to Borgata under
    long-term leases for use in its current operations and for its
    expansion. Of the remaining 120 acres, approximately
    72 acres are suitable for development. We lease nine of
    these developable acres to Borgata on a short-term basis for
    surface parking and a portion of the remaining acres consists of
    common roads, landscaping and master plan improvements which we
    designed and developed as required by our agreement with Boyd.
    We own an additional 14 acres in the Marina District near
    Renaissance Pointe.

In October 2007, we announced plans for a multi-billion dollar
    resort complex on our

72-acre

site
    in Atlantic City. Since making that announcement, we have made
    extensive progress in design and other pre-development
    activities. However, current economic conditions, including
    limited access to capital markets for projects of this scale,
    have caused us to reassess timing for this project. Accordingly,
    we have postponed current development activities.

Kerzner/Istithmar
    Joint Venture

In September 2007, we entered into a definitive agreement with
    Kerzner International and Istithmar forming a joint venture to
    develop a multi-billion dollar integrated resort to be located
    on the southwest corner of Las Vegas



Boulevard and Sahara Avenue. In September 2008, we and our
    partners agreed to defer additional design and pre-construction
    activities and amended our joint venture agreement accordingly.
    In the event the joint venture partners agree that the resort
    will be developed, we will contribute 40 acres of land, at
    an agreed value of $20 million per acre, for fifty percent
    of the equity in the joint venture. Kerzner International and
    Istithmar will contribute cash totaling $600 million, of
    which $200 million will be distributed to us, for the other
    50% of the equity.

Risks
    Associated With Our Growth Strategy

The principal risk factors relating to our growth strategy are:

•

Development and operation of gaming facilities in new or
    existing jurisdictions are subject to many contingencies.
    Several of these contingencies are outside of our control and
    may include the passage of appropriate gaming legislation, the
    issuance of necessary permits, licenses and approvals, the
    availability of appropriate financing and the satisfaction of
    other conditions;

•

Expansion projects involve risks and uncertainties. For
    instance, the design, timing and costs of the projects may
    change and are subject to risks attendant to large-scale
    projects.

Leveraging
    Our Brand and Management Assets

We also seek to leverage our management expertise and
    well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and
    international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of
    our brands, particularly the “MGM Grand” brand, are
    well suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming
    developments. The recently opened MGM Grand Macau and MGM Grand
    at Foxwoods, and the recently announced MGM Grand Abu Dhabi are
    all part of our brand expansion strategy.

In 2007, we formed MGM MIRAGE Hospitality, LLC
    (“Hospitality”). The purpose of this entity is to
    source strategic resort development and management
    opportunities, both gaming and non-gaming. Hospitality will have
    a particular focus on international opportunities, where we feel
    future growth opportunities are greatest. We have hired senior
    personnel with established backgrounds in the development and
    management of international hospitality operations to maximize
    the profit potential of Hospitality’s operations. In 2008,
    Hospitality announced the formation of MGM MIRAGE Global Gaming
    Development, a new subsidiary principally focused on
    international gaming expansion.

Mubadala
    Development Company

In November 2007, we announced plans to develop MGM Grand Abu
    Dhabi, a multi-billion dollar, large-scale, mixed-use
    development that will serve as an incoming gateway to Abu Dhabi,
    a United Arab Emirate, located at a prominent downtown
    waterfront site on Abu Dhabi Island. The project will be wholly
    owned by Mubadala; we will serve as developer of the project and
    manage the development for a fee. The initial phase will utilize
    50 acres and consist of an MGM Grand hotel, two additional
    MGM branded luxury hotels, and a variety of luxury residential
    offerings. Additionally, the development will feature a major
    entertainment facility, high-end retail shops, and world-class
    dining and convention facilities.

Mashantucket
    Pequot Tribal Nation

We entered into a series of agreements to implement a strategic
    alliance with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation
    (“MPTN”), which owns and operates Foxwoods Casino
    Resort in Ledyard, Connecticut. Under the strategic alliance, we
    consulted with MPTN in the development of a new
    $700 million casino resort adjacent to the existing
    Foxwoods casino resort. The new resort utilizes the “MGM
    Grand” brand name and opened in May 2008. We and MPTN have
    also formed a jointly owned company — Unity Gaming,
    LLC — to acquire or develop future gaming and
    non-gaming enterprises.



China

We have formed a joint venture with the Diaoyutai State
    Guesthouse in Beijing, People’s Republic of China, to
    develop luxury non-gaming hotels and resorts globally, initially
    targeting prime locations, including Beijing, in the
    People’s Republic of China.

Vietnam

In November 2008, we and Asian Coast Development
    Ltd.

announced plans to develop MGM Grand Ho
    Tram, which is expected to open in 2011. MGM Grand Ho Tram will
    anchor a multi-property complex on the Ho Tram Strip in the Ba
    Ria Vung Tau Province in southwest Vietnam. MGM Grand Ho Tram
    will be owned and financed by Asian Coast Development Ltd. and
    we will provide development assistance and operate the five-star
    integrated resort upon completion.

Risks
    Associated With Our Brand and Management Strategy

Operations in which we may engage in foreign territories are
    subject to risk pertaining to international operations. These
    may include financial risks: foreign currency, adverse tax
    consequences, inability to adequately enforce our rights; or
    regulatory and political risks: foreign government regulations,
    general geopolitical risks such as political and economic
    instability, hostilities with neighboring countries, and changes
    in diplomatic and trade relationships.

In addition, to the extent we become involved with development
    projects as an owner or investor, we are subject to similar
    risks as described in the “Sustainable Growth” section.

Employees
    and Labor Relations

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    46,000 full-time and 15,000 part-time employees. At
    that date, we had collective bargaining contracts with unions
    covering approximately 30,000 of our employees. We consider our
    employee relations to be good. In August 2007, we entered a new
    five-year collective bargaining agreement covering approximately
    21,000 of our Las Vegas Strip employees, not including MGM Grand
    Las Vegas. The collective bargaining agreement covering
    approximately 4,000 employees at MGM Grand Las Vegas
    expired in 2008. We have signed an extension of such agreement
    and are currently negotiating a new agreement. In addition, in
    October 2007 we entered into a new four-year agreement covering
    approximately 2,900 employees at MGM Grand Detroit.

Regulation
    and Licensing

The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain
    our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations.
    Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the
    laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where it is
    located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the
    responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners,
    managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming
    operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result
    in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed
    description of the regulations to which we are subject is
    contained in Exhibit 99.2 to this Annual Report on

Form 10-K,

which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local
    laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These
    laws and regulations include, but are not limited to,
    restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages,
    environmental matters, employees, currency transactions,
    taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and
    advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be
    interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and
    regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or
    regulations, or material differences in interpretations by
    courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our
    operating results.



Forward-Looking
    Statements

(Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995)

This

Form 10-K

and our 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders contain some
    forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our
    current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can
    identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate
    strictly to historical or current facts. They contain words such
    as “anticipate,” “estimate,”
    “expect,” “project,” “intend,”
    “plan,” “believe,” “may,”
    “could,” “might,” and other words or phrases
    of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future
    operating or financial performance. In particular, these include
    statements relating to future actions, new projects, future
    performance, the outcome of contingencies such as legal
    proceedings, and future financial results. From time to time, we
    also provide oral or written forward-looking statements in our

Forms 10-Q

and

8-K,

as
    well as press releases and other materials we release to the
    public. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this

Form 10-K,

in our 2008 Annual Report to Stockholders and in any other
    public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be
    affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or
    unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in this

Form 10-K —

for example, government regulation and the competitive
    environment — will be important in determining our
    future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can
    be guaranteed. Our actual future results may differ materially.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update any
    forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
    information, future events or otherwise. You are advised,
    however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related
    subjects in our

Forms 10-K,

10-Q

and

8-K

reports
    to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
    Also note that we provide a discussion of risks, uncertainties
    and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business in
    Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” This discussion is
    provided as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation
    Reform Act of 1995.

You should also be aware that while we from time to time
    communicate with securities analysts, we do not disclose to them
    any material non-public information, internal forecasts or other
    confidential business information. Therefore, you should not
    assume that we agree with any statement or report issued by any
    analyst, irrespective of the content of the statement or report.
    To the extent that reports issued by securities analysts contain
    projections, forecasts or opinions, those reports are not our
    responsibility.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events
    described in this section and elsewhere in this report or in any
    other of our filings with the SEC could have a material adverse
    effect on our business, financial position, results of
    operations and cash flows. In evaluating us, you should consider
    carefully, among other things, the risks described below.

•

Our substantial indebtedness and significant financial
    commitments could adversely affect our operations and financial
    results and impact our ability to satisfy our
    obligations.

As of December 31, 2008, we had
    approximately $13.5 billion of indebtedness. In late
    February 2009, we borrowed $842 million under our senior
    credit facility, which amount represented — after
    giving effect to $93 million in outstanding letters of
    credit — the total amount of unused borrowing capacity
    available under our $7.0 billion senior credit facility. In
    connection with the waiver and amendment described below, on
    March 17, 2009 we repaid $300 million under the senior
    credit facility, which amount is not available for reborrowing
    without the consent of the lenders. We have no other existing
    sources of borrowing availability, except to the extent we pay
    down further amounts outstanding under the senior credit
    facility.

As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately
    $2.8 billion of financial commitments and estimated capital
    expenditures in 2009, excluding commitments under employment,
    entertainment and other operational agreements. Furthermore, the
    interest rate applicable to our borrowings under the senior
    credit facility is based on variable reference rates and our
    leverage ratio. Any increase in the interest rates applicable to
    our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our
    indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our
    other liquidity needs. Our substantial indebtedness and
    significant financial commitments could have important negative
    consequences, including:

—

increasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry
    conditions;

—

limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,
    changes in our business and industry;

—

limiting our ability to borrow additional funds; and

—

placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other less
    leveraged competitors.

•

Our senior credit facility contains financial covenants, and
    we do not expect to be in compliance with such financial
    covenants in 2009.

While we were in compliance
    with the financial covenants under our senior credit facility at
    December 31, 2008, if the recent adverse conditions in the
    economy in general — and the gaming industry in
    particular — continue, we believe that we will not be
    in compliance with those financial covenants during 2009. In
    fact, given these conditions and the recent borrowing under the
    senior credit facility, we do not expect to be in compliance
    with those financial covenants at March 31, 2009. As a
    result, on March 17, 2009 we obtained from the lenders
    under the senior credit facility a waiver of the requirement
    that we comply with such financial covenants through
    May 15, 2009. Additionally, we entered into an amendment of
    our senior credit facility which provides for, among other
    terms, the following:

—

We agreed to repay $300 million of the outstanding
    borrowings under the senior credit facility, which amount is not
    available for reborrowing without the consent of the lenders;

—

We are prohibited from prepaying or repurchasing our outstanding
    long-term debt or disposing of material assets; and other
    restrictive covenants were added that limit our ability to make
    investments and incur indebtedness;



—

The interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the senior
    credit facility was increased by 100 basis points; and

—

Our required equity contributions in CityCenter are limited
    through May 15, 2009 such that we can only make
    contributions if Infinity World makes its required
    contributions; our equity contributions do not exceed specified
    amounts (though we believe the limitation is in excess of the
    amounts expected to be required through May 15, 2009); and
    the CityCenter senior secured credit facility has not been
    accelerated.

Following expiration of the waiver on May 15, 2009, we will
    be subject to an event of default related to the expected
    noncompliance with financial covenants under the senior credit
    facility at March 31, 2009. We intend to work with our
    lenders to obtain additional waivers or amendments prior to
    May 15, 2009 to address future noncompliance with the
    senior credit facility; however, we can provide no assurance
    that we will be able to secure such waivers or amendments. The
    lenders holding at least a majority of the principal amount
    under our senior credit facility could, among other actions,
    accelerate the obligation to repay borrowings under our senior
    credit facility in such an event of default. As a result of such
    event of default, under certain circumstances, cross defaults
    could occur under our indentures and the CityCenter
    $1.8 billion senior secured credit facility, which could
    accelerate the obligation to repay amounts outstanding under
    such indentures and the CityCenter credit facility and could
    result in termination of the unfunded commitments under the
    CityCenter credit facility. If the lenders exercise any or all
    such rights, we or CityCenter may determine to seek relief
    through a filing under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

•

There is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a
    going concern

.  The uncertainties described above
    regarding 1) our ability to meet our financial commitments,
    and 2) our potential noncompliance with financial covenants
    under our senior credit facility, raise a substantial doubt
    about our ability to continue as a going concern. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include
    any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the
    recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
    classifications of liabilities that may result should we be
    unable to continue as a going concern. As a result, the report
    of our independent registered public accounting firm on our
    consolidated financial statements for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 contains an explanatory paragraph with
    respect to our ability to continue as a going concern. We can
    provide no assurance that we will be able to secure a waiver or
    amendment related to potential noncompliance under our senior
    credit facility or be able to address our 2009 financial
    commitments in such a way as to be able to continue as a going
    concern.

•

Current economic conditions adversely impact our ability to
    service or refinance our indebtedness and to make planned
    expenditures.

Our ability to make payments on,
    and to refinance, our indebtedness and to fund planned or
    committed capital expenditures and investments in joint
    ventures, such as CityCenter, depends on our ability to generate
    cash flow in the future and our ability to borrow under our
    senior credit facility to the extent of available borrowings. If
    adverse regional and national economic conditions persist,
    worsen, or fail to improve significantly, we could experience
    decreased revenues from our operations attributable to decreases
    in consumer spending levels and could fail to generate
    sufficient cash to fund our liquidity needs or fail to satisfy
    the financial and other restrictive covenants which we are
    subject to under our indebtedness. We cannot provide assurance
    that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from
    operations or that future borrowings will be available to us
    under our senior credit facility in an amount sufficient to
    enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity
    needs.

•

Our casinos in Las Vegas and elsewhere are destination
    resorts that compete with other destination travel locations
    throughout the United States and the world.

We do
    not believe that our competition is limited to a particular
    geographic area, and gaming operations in other states or
    countries could attract our customers. To the extent that new
    casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by
    others in major destination locations, competition will
    increase. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either
    recently expanded their hotel room capacity or are currently
    expanding their capacity or constructing new resorts in Las
    Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas,
    including California, has increased the competition faced by our
    operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. In particular, as large
    scale gaming operations in Native American tribal lands has
    increased, particularly in California, competition has increased.



•

The ownership and operation of gaming facilities are subject
    to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and
    ordinances, which are administered by the relevant regulatory
    agencies in each jurisdiction.

These laws,
    regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to
    jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility,
    financial stability and character of the owners and managers of
    gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or
    involved in gaming operations. As such, our gaming regulators
    can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or
    business partners found unsuitable by the regulators. In
    addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our
    domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates in any
    jurisdiction could have a negative impact on our ability to
    continue operating in other jurisdictions. For a summary of
    gaming regulations that affect our business, see
    “Regulation and Licensing.” The regulatory environment
    in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any
    such change could have a material adverse effect on our results
    of operations. In addition, we are subject to various gaming
    taxes, which are subject to possible increase at any time.

•

Our business is affected by economic and market conditions in
    the markets in which we operate and in the locations our
    customers reside.

Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas,
    Mandalay Bay and The Mirage are particularly affected by
    economic conditions in the Far East, and all of our Nevada
    resorts are affected by economic conditions in the United
    States, and California in particular. A recession, economic
    slowdown or other economic issues affecting consumers is likely
    to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts, which would
    adversely affect our operating results.

For example, the downturn in consumer spending and economic
    conditions that existed in 2008, and is expected to continue in
    2009, has had a negative impact on our results of operations. In
    addition, the weak housing and real estate market —
    both generally and in Nevada particularly — has
    negatively impacted CityCenter’s ability to sell
    residential units.

•

Certain of our casino properties are located in areas that
    may be subject to extreme weather conditions, including, but not
    limited to, hurricanes.

Such extreme weather
    conditions may interrupt our operations, damage our properties,
    and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in
    such areas. Although we maintain both property and business
    interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather
    conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits
    on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period
    for business interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will
    be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all,
    on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions.
    Furthermore, such extreme weather conditions may interrupt or
    impede access to our affected properties and may cause visits to
    our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period.

•

We are a large consumer of electricity and other
    energy.

Accordingly, increases in energy costs,
    such as those experienced in 2007 and 2008, may have a negative
    impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher energy and
    gasoline prices which affect our customers may result in reduced
    visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues.

•

Many of our customers travel by air.

As a
    result, the cost and availability of air service and the impact
    of any events which disrupt air travel can affect our business.
    We cannot control the number or frequency of flights into or out
    of Las Vegas, but we rely on air traffic for a significant
    portion or our visitors. Reductions in flights by major
    airlines, such as those implemented in 2008 as a result of
    higher fuel prices and lower demand, can impact the number of
    visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal
    interstate highway between Las Vegas and Southern California,
    where a large number of our customers reside. Capacity
    constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may
    also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities.

•

Leisure and business travel, especially travel by air, are
    particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as
    terrorist attacks or acts of war or
    hostility.

These events can create economic and
    political uncertainties that could adversely impact our business
    levels. Furthermore, although we have been able to purchase some
    insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts,
    insurance coverage against loss or business interruption
    resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be
    unavailable.



•

Our City Center joint venture involves significant
    risks.

The development and ultimate operation of
    CityCenter is subject to unique risk given the scope of the
    development and financing requirements placed on us and our
    partner, Infinity World. If we or our partner are unable to meet
    our funding requirements or if City Center’s
    $1.8 billion senior secured credit facility is
    terminated — for instance, due to cross defaults at
    the partner level — then this could cause the
    development of CityCenter to be delayed or suspended
    indefinitely. Such an event could have adverse financial
    consequences to us.

•

Our joint venture in Macau S.A.R. involves significant
    risks.

The operation of MGM Grand Macau, 50%
    owned by us, is subject to unique risks, including risks related
    to: (a) Macau’s regulatory framework; (b) our
    ability to adapt to the different regulatory and gaming
    environment in Macau while remaining in compliance with the
    requirements of the gaming regulatory authorities in the
    jurisdictions in which we currently operate, as well as other
    applicable federal, state, or local laws in the United States
    and Macau; (c) potential political or economic instability;
    and (d) the extreme weather conditions in the region.

Furthermore, such operations in Macau or any future operations
    in which we may engage in any other foreign territories are
    subject to risk pertaining to international operations. These
    may include financial risks, such as foreign economy, adverse
    tax consequences, and inability to adequately enforce our
    rights. These may also include regulatory and political risks,
    such as foreign government regulations, general geopolitical
    risks such as political and economic instability, hostilities
    with neighboring counties, and changes in diplomatic and trade
    relationships.

•

Our plans for future construction can be affected by a number
    of factors, including time delays in obtaining necessary
    governmental permits and approvals and legal
    challenges.

We may make changes in project scope,
    budgets and schedules for competitive, aesthetic or other
    reasons, and these changes may also result from circumstances
    beyond our control. These circumstances include weather
    interference, shortages of materials and labor, work stoppages,
    labor disputes, unforeseen engineering, environmental or
    geological problems, and unanticipated cost increases. Any of
    these circumstances could give rise to delays or cost overruns.
    Major expansion projects at our existing resorts can also result
    in disruption of our business during the construction period.

•

Claims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in
    various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims
    arise from time to time.

It is possible that our
    cash flows and results of operations could be affected by the
    resolution of these claims. Please see the further discussion in
    Item 3. “Legal Proceedings.”

•

Tracinda Corporation beneficially owned approximately 54% of
    our outstanding common stock as of December 31,
    2008.

As a result, Tracinda Corporation has the
    ability to elect our entire Board of Directors and determine the
    outcome of other matters submitted to our stockholders, such as
    the approval of significant transactions.

•

A significant portion of our labor force is covered by
    collective bargaining agreements.

Approximately
    30,000 of our 61,000 employees are covered by collective
    bargaining agreements. A prolonged dispute with the covered
    employees could have an adverse impact on our operations. In
    addition, wage and or benefit increases resulting from new labor
    agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse
    impact on our results of operations. The collective bargaining
    agreement covering approximately 4,000 employees at MGM
    Grand Las Vegas expired in 2008. We have signed an extension of
    such agreement and are currently negotiating a new agreement.

    all the assets of that resort, serve as collateral for our
    13% Senior Secured Notes due 2013 issued in 2008.

Borgata occupies approximately 46 acres at Renaissance
    Pointe, including 19 acres we lease to Borgata. Borgata
    owns approximately 27 acres which are used as collateral
    for bank credit facilities in the amount of up to
    $850 million. As of December 31, 2008,
    $741 million was outstanding under the bank credit facility.

MGM Grand Macau occupies an approximately 10 acre site
    which it possesses under a 25 year land use right agreement

    for MGM Grand Paradise Limited’s bank credit facility. As
    of December 31, 2008, approximately $818 million was
    outstanding under the bank credit facility. At December 31,
    2008, MGM Grand Paradise Limited obtained a waiver of its
    financial covenants under the bank credit facility.

Silver Legacy occupies approximately five acres in Reno, Nevada,
    adjacent to Circus Circus Reno. The site is used as collateral
    for Silver Legacy’s senior credit facility and 10.125%
    mortgage notes. As of December 31, 2008, $160 million
    of principal of the 10.125% mortgage notes were outstanding.

    2008, there is $1.0 billion outstanding under the
    CityCenter bank credit facility, though such borrowings are held
    as restricted cash by the venture.

All of the borrowings by our unconsolidated affiliates described
    above are non-recourse to MGM MIRAGE. Other than as described
    above, none of our other assets serve as collateral.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

Mandalay
    Bay Ticket Processing Fee Litigation

On July 14, 2008, the Company was served with a putative
    class action lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in
    California (

Jeff Feld v. Mandalay Corp. d/b/a Mandalay
    Bay Resort & Casino

). The action purports to be
    brought pursuant to California’s Consumer Legal Remedies
    Act on behalf of all California residents who during the
    previous six years purchased event tickets from our subsidiary,
    paid a separate processing fee in addition to the ticket price,
    and did not receive or received inaccurate notice of the
    processing fee when they purchased the ticket. The plaintiff
    alleges that our subsidiary advertised event tickets at a
    specified price and then charged purchasers undisclosed
    additional fees, specifically a $5 processing fee, and that the
    foregoing was unlawful, a breach of contract, an unfair business
    practice, and a violation of California’s Civil Code and
    Business & Professions Code. The plaintiff was seeking
    unspecified monetary damages including restitution, injunctive
    relief, attorneys’ fees and costs. In February 2009,
    Mandalay Bay reached a satisfactory settlement with the
    individual plaintiff in this action. The settlement and
    dismissal of the action against Mandalay Bay and the Company are
    subject to court approval. No class has been certified in this
    case.

Other

We and our subsidiaries are also defendants in various other
    lawsuits, most of which relate to routine matters incidental to
    our business. We do not believe that the outcome of this other
    pending litigation, considered in the aggregate, will have a
    material adverse effect on the Company.

There were approximately 4,198 record holders of our common
    stock as of March 9, 2009.

We have not paid dividends on our common stock in the last two
    fiscal years. As a holding company with no independent
    operations, our ability to pay dividends will depend upon the
    receipt of dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries.
    Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains financial
    covenants that could restrict our ability to pay dividends. Our
    Board of Directors periodically reviews our policy with respect
    to dividends, and any determination to pay dividends in the
    future will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors.

Share
    Repurchases

Our share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase
    programs approved by our Board of Directors and publicly
    announced. We did not repurchase shares of our common stock
    during the quarter ended December 31, 2008. The maximum
    number of shares available for repurchase under our May 2008
    repurchase program was 20 million as of December 31,
    2008.

•

In July 2004, we sold the subsidiaries that owned and operated
    MGM Grand Australia.

•

In April 2007, we sold the Primm Valley Resorts.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

Executive
    Overview

Liquidity
    and Financial Position

We have significant indebtedness and significant financial
    commitments in 2009. As of December 31, 2008, we had
    approximately $13.5 billion of total long-term debt. In
    late February 2009, we borrowed $842 million under our
    senior credit facility, which amount represented —
    after giving effect to $93 million in outstanding letters
    of credit — the total amount of unused borrowing
    capacity available under our $7.0 billion senior credit
    facility In connection with the waiver and amendment described
    below, on March 17, 2009 we repaid $300 million under
    the senior credit facility, which amount is not available for
    reborrowing without the consent of the lenders. We have no other
    existing sources of borrowing availability, except to the extent
    we pay down further amounts outstanding under the senior credit
    facility.

In addition to commitments under employment, entertainment and
    other operational agreements, our financial commitments and
    estimated capital expenditures in 2009, as of December 31,
    2008, totaled approximately $2.8 billion — see
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources — Commitments
    and Contractual Obligations” — and consisted of:

•

Contractual maturities of long-term debt totaling approximately
    $1.0 billion;

•

Interest payments on long-term debt, estimated at
    $0.8 billion;

•

CityCenter required equity contributions of approximately
    $0.7 billion;

•

Other commitments of approximately $0.3 billion, including
    $0.2 billion of estimated capital expenditures;

To fund our anticipated 2009 financial commitments, we have the
    following sources of funds in 2009:

•

Available borrowings under our senior credit facility of
    $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2008;

•

Expected proceeds in 2009 from the sale of TI of approximately
    $0.6 billion;

•

Operating cash flow:  Our current expectations for
    2009 indicate that operating cash flow will be lower than in
    2008. In 2008, we generated approximately $1.8 billion of
    cash flow from operations before deducting a) cash paid for
    interest, which commitments are included in the list above, and
    b) the tax payment on the 2007 CityCenter transaction.

We are uncertain as to whether the sources listed above will be
    sufficient to fund our 2009 financial commitments and we cannot
    provide any assurances that we will be able to raise additional
    capital to fund our anticipated expenditures in 2009 if the
    sources listed above are not adequate.

While we were in compliance with the financial covenants under
    our senior credit facility at December 31, 2008, if the
    recent adverse conditions in the economy in general —
    and the gaming industry in particular — continue, we
    believe that we will not be in compliance with those financial
    covenants during 2009. In fact, given these conditions and the
    recent borrowing under the senior credit facility, we do not
    believe we will be in compliance with those financial covenants
    at March 31, 2009. As a result, on March 17, 2009 we
    obtained from the lenders under the senior credit facility a
    waiver of the requirement that we comply with such financial
    covenants through May 15, 2009. Additionally, we entered
    into an amendment of our senior credit facility which provides
    for, among other terms, the following:

•

We agreed to repay $300 million of the outstanding
    borrowings under the senior credit facility, which amount is not
    available for reborrowing without the consent of the lenders;

•

We are prohibited from prepaying or repurchasing our outstanding
    long-term debt or disposing of material assets; and other
    restrictive covenants were added that limit our ability to make
    investments and incur indebtedness;

•

The interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the senior
    credit facility was increased by 100 basis points; and

•

Our required equity contributions in CityCenter are limited
    through May 15, 2009 such that we can only make
    contributions if Infinity World makes its required
    contributions; our equity contributions do not exceed



specified amounts (though we believe the limitation is in excess
    of the amounts expected to be required through May 15,
    2009); and the CityCenter senior secured credit facility has not
    been accelerated.

Following expiration of the waiver on May 15, 2009, we will
    be subject to an event of default related to the expected
    noncompliance with financial covenants under the senior credit
    facility at March 31, 2009. Under the terms of the senior
    credit facility, noncompliance with financial covenants is an
    event of default, under which the lenders (with a vote of more
    than 50% of the lenders) may exercise any or all of the
    following remedies:

•

Terminate their commitments to fund additional borrowings;

•

Require cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit;

•

Demand immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings under
    the senior credit facility: and

•

Decline to release subsidiary guarantees which would impact our
    ability to execute asset dispositions.

In addition, there are provisions in certain of the indentures
    governing our senior and senior subordinated notes under which
    a) the event of default under the senior secured credit
    facility, or b) the remedies under an event of default
    under the senior credit facility, would cause an event of
    default under the relevant senior and senior subordinated notes,
    which would also allow holders of our senior and senior
    subordinated notes to demand immediate repayment and decline to
    release subsidiary guarantees. Also, under the terms of the
    CityCenter senior secured credit facility, if an event of
    default has occurred under our borrowings and a) such event
    of default is certified to in writing by the relevant lenders,
    and b) such default allows the relevant lenders to demand
    immediate repayment, then an event of default has occurred
    relative to the CityCenter senior secured credit facility. Under
    such event of default, one of the remedies is the termination of
    the CityCenter senior secured credit facility. If the lenders
    exercise any or all such rights, we or CityCenter may determine
    to seek relief through a filing under the U.S. Bankruptcy
    Code.

The conditions and events described above raise a substantial
    doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include
    any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the
    recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
    classifications of liabilities that may result should we be
    unable to continue as a going concern.

We intend to work with the lenders to obtain additional waivers
    or amendments prior to May 15, 2009 to address future
    noncompliance with our senior credit facility; however, we can
    provide no assurance that we will be able to secure such waivers
    or amendments.

We have also retained the services of outside advisors to assist
    us in instituting and implementing any required programs to
    accomplish management’s objectives. We are evaluating the
    possibility of a) disposing of certain assets,
    b) raising additional debt

and/or

equity capital, and c) modifying or extending our long-term
    debt. However, there can be no assurance that we will be
    successful in achieving our objectives.

Current
    Operations

At December 31, 2008, our operations consisted of 17
    wholly-owned casino resorts and 50% investments in four other
    casino resorts, including:

Las Vegas, Nevada:

Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, The Mirage, Luxor,
    TI, New York-New

York, Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Circus Circus Las Vegas and
    Slots-A-Fun.

Other:

Circus Circus Reno and Silver Legacy (50% owned) in Reno,
    Nevada; Gold Strike in

Jean, Nevada; Railroad Pass in Henderson, Nevada; MGM Grand
    Detroit; Beau Rivage in

Biloxi, Mississippi and Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica,
    Mississippi; Borgata (50% owned) in

Atlantic City, New Jersey; Grand Victoria (50% owned) in Elgin,
    Illinois; and MGM Grand

Macau (50% owned).

Other operations include the Shadow Creek golf course in North
    Las Vegas; the Primm Valley Golf Club at the California state
    line; and Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi. In
    December 2008, we entered into an agreement to sell TI for
    $775 million; the sale is expected to close by
    June 30, 2009.



We own 50% of CityCenter, currently under development on a

67-acre

site
    on the Las Vegas Strip, between Bellagio and Monte Carlo.
    Infinity World Development Corp. (“Infinity World”), a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab
    Emirates government decree entity, owns the other 50% of
    CityCenter. CityCenter will feature a 4,000-room casino resort
    designed by world-famous architect Cesar Pelli; two 400-room
    non-gaming boutique hotels, one of which will be managed by
    luxury hotelier Mandarin Oriental; approximately
    425,000 square feet of retail shops, dining and
    entertainment venues; and approximately 2.1 million square
    feet of residential space in approximately 2,400 luxury
    condominium and condominium-hotel units in multiple towers.
    CityCenter is expected to open in late 2009, except CityCenter
    postponed the opening of The Harmon Hotel & Spa until
    late 2010 and cancelled the development of approximately 200
    residential units originally planned. We are serving as the
    developer of CityCenter and, upon completion of construction, we
    will manage CityCenter for a fee.

Key
    Performance Indicators

Our primary business is the ownership and operation of casino
    resorts, which includes offering gaming, hotel, dining,
    entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. Over half of
    our net revenue is derived from non-gaming activities, a higher
    percentage than many of our competitors, as our operating
    philosophy is to provide a complete resort experience for our
    guests, including non-gaming amenities which command above
    market prices based on their quality. Our significant convention
    and meeting facilities allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and
    customer volumes during off-peak times such as mid-week or
    during traditionally slower leisure travel periods, which also
    leads to better labor utilization. We believe that we own
    several of the premier casino resorts in the world and have
    continually reinvested in our resorts to maintain our
    competitive advantage.

As a resort-based company, our operating results are highly
    dependent on the volume of customers at our resorts, which in
    turn impacts the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and
    other amenities. We also generate a significant portion of our
    operating income from the high-end gaming customers, which can
    cause variability in our results. Key performance indicators
    related to revenue are:

•

Gaming revenue indicators — table games drop and slots
    handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold”
    percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal
    table games win percentage is in the range of 18% to 22% of
    table games drop and our normal slots win percentage is in the
    range of 6.5% to 7.5% of slots handle;

•

Hotel revenue indicators — hotel occupancy (volume
    indicator); average daily rate (“ADR”, price
    indicator); revenue per available room (“REVPAR”), a
    summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy
    rate.

Most of our revenue is essentially cash-based, through customers
    wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash
    or credit cards. Our resorts, like many in the industry,
    generate significant operating cash flow. Our industry is
    capital intensive and we rely heavily on the ability of our
    resorts to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing,
    fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash
    for future development.

We generate a majority of our net revenues and operating income
    from our resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada, which exposes us to
    certain risks outside of our control, such as increased
    competition from new or expanded Las Vegas resorts, and the
    impact from expansion of gaming in California. We are also
    exposed to risks related to tourism and the general economy,
    including national and global economic conditions and terrorist
    attacks or other global events.

Our results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature,
    though a variety of factors may affect the results of any
    interim period, including the timing of major Las Vegas
    conventions, the amount and timing of marketing and special
    events for our high-end customers, and the level of play during
    major holidays, including New Year and Chinese New Year. We
    market to different customer segments to manage our hotel
    occupancy, such as targeting large conventions to ensure
    mid-week occupancy. Our results do not depend on key individual
    customers, though our success in marketing to customer groups,
    such as convention customers, or the financial health of
    customer segments, such as business travelers or high-end gaming
    customers from a particular country or region, can impact our
    results.



Impact of
    Current Economic Conditions and Credit Markets on Results of
    Operations

The current state of the United States economy has negatively
    impacted our results of operations during 2008 and we expect
    these impacts to continue in 2009. The decrease in liquidity in
    the credit markets which began in late 2007 and accelerated in
    late 2008 has significantly impacted our Company.

We believe recent economic conditions and our customers’
    inability to access near-term credit has led to a shift in
    spending from discretionary items to fundamental costs like
    housing, as witnessed in broader indications of consumer
    behavior such as the declining sales trends in automobile and
    other retail sales and other discretionary spending in sectors
    like restaurants. We believe these factors have impacted our
    customers’ willingness to plan vacations and conventions
    and their level of spending while at our resorts. Other
    conditions currently or recently present in the economic
    environment are conditions which tend to negatively impact our
    results, such as:

•

Weak housing market and significant declines in housing prices
    and related home equity;

•

Higher oil and gas prices which impact travel costs;

•

Weaknesses in employment and increases in unemployment;

•

Decreases in air capacity to Las Vegas; and

•

Decreases in equity market value, which impacted many of our
    customers.

See “Goodwill Impairment” and “Operating
    Results — Detailed Revenue Information” for
    specific impacts of these conditions on our results of
    operations. Beyond the impact on our operating results, these
    factors have led to a significant decrease in equity market
    value in general and in our market capitalization specifically.

Given the uncertainty in the economy and the unprecedented
    nature of the situation with the financial and credit markets,
    forecasting future results has become very difficult. In
    addition, leading indicators such as forward room bookings are
    difficult to assess, as our booking window has shortened
    significantly due to consumer uncertainty. Businesses and
    consumers appear to have altered their spending patterns which
    may lead to further decreases in visitor volumes and customer
    spending including convention and conference customers
    cancelling or postponing their events.

Because of these economic conditions, we have increasingly
    focused on managing costs. For example, we have reduced our
    salaried management positions; we did not pay discretionary
    bonuses in 2008 due to not meeting our internal profit targets;
    we suspended Company contributions to certain nonqualified
    deferred compensation plans; and we have been managing staffing
    levels across all our resorts. For the full year of 2008, the
    average number of full-time equivalents at our resorts decreased
    7%. We continue to review costs at the corporate and operating
    levels to identify further opportunities for cost reductions.

Additionally, our results of operations are impacted by
    decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access
    to capital, and our cost of capital; all of which are impacted
    by the uncertain state of the global economy and the continued
    instability in the capital markets. For example:

•

We postponed development on MGM Grand Atlantic City and our
    joint venture with Kerzner and Istithmar for a Las Vegas Strip
    project;

•

We have significantly reduced our estimated capital expenditures
    for 2009;

•

We entered into an agreement in December 2008 to sell TI for
    $775 million;

•

The ability of CityCenter to obtain project financing was
    negatively impacted by credit market conditions, leading to a
    longer process than anticipated, with more funding from the
    venture partners required than anticipated;

•

In connection with the September 2008 amendment to our bank
    credit facility to increase the maximum leverage covenant, we
    will incur higher interest costs;

•

Our recent senior secured notes offering was completed at a
    higher interest rate than our existing fixed-rate indebtedness;

•

As discussed above, in February 2009, we borrowed
    $842 million, the remaining amount of available funds
    (other than outstanding letters of credit) under our senior
    credit facility, which will increase our interest costs;



•

In February 2009, all of the major credit rating
    agencies — Moody’s, Standard & Poors,
    and Fitch — downgraded the rating on our long-term
    debt and in March 2009, Moody’s downgraded our rating
    again. These rating downgrades may make it more difficult to
    obtain debt financing or may increase the cost of our future
    debt financing; and

•

Based on our current financial situation, we may be required to
    alter our working capital management practices to, for instance,
    post cash collateral for purchases or pay vendors on different
    terms than we have in the past.

Goodwill
    Impairment

With respect to our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
    assets, we performed our annual test during the fourth quarter
    of 2008. As a result of this analysis, we recognized a non-cash
    impairment charge of $1.18 billion related to goodwill and
    certain indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth
    quarter. The impairment charge relates solely to the goodwill
    and other indefinite-lived intangible assets recognized in the
    2005 acquisition of Mandalay Resort Group, and represents
    substantially all of the goodwill recognized at the time of the
    Mandalay acquisition and a minor portion of the value of trade
    names related to the Mandalay resorts. The impairment charge
    resulted from factors impacted by current economic conditions,
    including: 1) lower market valuation multiples for gaming
    assets; 2) higher discount rates resulting from turmoil in
    the credit and equity markets; and 3) current cash flow
    forecasts for the Mandalay resorts.

Other
    Items Affecting Future Operating Results

Our Las Vegas Strip resorts require ongoing capital investment
    to maintain their competitive advantages. We believe the
    investments we have made in the past several years in additional
    non-gaming amenities relative to our competitors enhances our
    ability to maintain visitor volume and allows us to charge
    higher prices for our amenities relative to our competitors. In
    2008, we completed many improvements at our Las Vegas strip
    resorts, including:

•

A remodel of approximately 2,700 standard rooms at The Mirage,
    approximately 2,700 standard rooms at TI, approximately 1,100
    rooms at Gold Strike Tunica, and approximately 900 rooms at
    Excalibur.

•

A new Cirque du Soleil production show,

Believe

featuring
    Criss Angel, at Luxor.

•

New restaurants and bars such as BLT Burger at The Mirage,
    RokVegas at New York-New York, Brand Steakhouse at Monte Carlo,
    and Yellowtail at Bellagio.

•

A complete re-design and refurbishment of the casino floor at
    New York-New York.

In addition, the following items are relevant to our overall
    outlook:

•

In August 2007, we entered into a new five-year collective
    bargaining agreement covering approximately 21,000 of our Las
    Vegas Strip employees. The new agreement provides for increases
    in wages and benefits of approximately 4% annually. This does
    not include the collective bargaining agreement covering
    employees at MGM Grand Las Vegas, which expired in 2008. A new
    agreement for MGM Grand Las Vegas is currently being negotiated.
    In addition, in October 2007 we entered into a new four-year
    labor agreement covering approximately 2,900 employees at
    MGM Grand Detroit which provides for average annual increases in
    wages and benefits of approximately 6%.

•

We expect to recognize a substantial gain from the sale of TI
    during 2009.

Financial
    Statement Impact of Hurricane Katrina and the Monte Carlo
    Fire

We maintain insurance covering both property damage and business
    interruption relating to catastrophic events, such as Hurricane
    Katrina affecting Beau Rivage in August 2005 and the rooftop
    fire at Monte Carlo in January 2008. Business interruption
    coverage covered lost profits and other costs incurred during
    the construction period and up to six months following the
    reopening of the facility.

Non-refundable insurance recoveries received in excess of the
    net book value of damaged assets,

clean-up

and
    demolition costs, and post-event costs are recognized as income
    in the period received or committed based on our estimate of the
    total claim for property damage (recorded as “Property
    transactions, net”) and business interruption (recorded as
    a reduction of “General and administrative” expenses)
    compared to the recoveries received at that time. All post-event
    costs and expected recoveries are recorded net within
    “General and administrative” expenses, except for
    depreciation of non-damaged assets, which is classified as
    “Depreciation and amortization.”



Insurance recoveries are classified in the statement of cash
    flows based on the coverage to which they relate. Recoveries
    related to business interruption are classified as operating
    cash flows and recoveries related to property damage are
    classified as investing cash flows. We classify insurance
    recoveries as being related to property damage until the full
    amount of damaged assets and demolition costs are recovered, and
    classify additional recoveries up to the amount of post-event
    costs incurred as being related to business interruption.
    Insurance recoveries beyond that amount are classified as
    operating or investing cash flows based on our estimated
    allocation of the total claim.

Hurricane Katrina.

By December 31, 2007,
    we had reached final settlement agreements with our insurance
    carriers and received insurance recoveries of $635 million
    which exceeded the $265 million of net book value of
    damaged assets and post-storm costs incurred. During the year
    ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $284 million of
    insurance recoveries in income, of which $217 million was
    recorded within “Property transactions, net” and
    $67 million was recorded within “General and
    administrative expense.” The remaining $86 million
    previously recognized in income was recorded within
    “Property transactions, net” in 2006.

During 2007, we received $280 million in insurance
    recoveries, of which $207 million was classified as
    investing cash flows and $73 million was classified as
    operating cash flows. During 2006, we received $309 million
    in insurance recoveries related to Hurricane Katrina, of which
    $210 million was classified as investing cash flows and
    $99 million was classified as operating cash flows.

Monte Carlo.

As of December 31, 2008, we
    had received $50 million of proceeds from our insurance
    carriers related to the Monte Carlo fire and recognized
    $19 million of insurance recoveries in income, of which
    $10 million was recorded within “Property
    transactions, net” and $9 million was recorded within
    “General and administrative expenses.” Also, in 2008,
    we recorded a write-down of $4 million related to the net
    book value of damaged assets, demolition costs of
    $7 million, and operating costs of $21 million related
    to the fire.

On a consolidated basis, the most significant events and trends
    contributing to our performance over the last three years have
    been:

•

The economic factors discussed in “Impact of Current
    Economic Conditions and Credit Markets on Results of
    Operations.”

•

The rooftop fire at Monte Carlo in January 2008, which caused
    the closure of the resort for several weeks and reduced the
    number of rooms available at Monte Carlo for the remainder of
    2008.

•

Recognition of a $1.2 billion impairment charge in the
    fourth quarter of 2008 related to goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets recognized in the Mandalay acquisition in
    2005. This non-cash charge is recorded in “Property
    transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations.

•

Recognition of a $1.03 billion gain in 2007 related to the
    contribution of the CityCenter assets to a joint venture.

•

The closure of Beau Rivage in August 2005 after Hurricane
    Katrina and subsequent reopening in August 2006, and income
    related to insurance recoveries. Operating income at Beau Rivage
    includes income from insurance recoveries of $284 million
    in 2007 and $86 million in 2006.

•

Recognition of our share of profits from the closings of
    condominium units of The Signature at MGM Grand, which were
    complete as of December 31, 2007. The venture recorded
    revenue and cost of sales as units closed. In 2007, we
    recognized income of approximately $84 million related to
    our share of the venture’s profits and $8 million of
    deferred profit on land contributed to the venture. In 2006, we
    recognized income of approximately $102 million related to
    our share of the venture’s profits and $15 million of
    deferred profit on land contributed to the venture. These
    amounts are classified in “Income from unconsolidated
    affiliates” in the accompanying consolidated statements of
    operations.

•

Recognition of an $88 million pre-tax gain on the
    repurchase of certain of our outstanding senior notes and
    redemption of our 7% debentures in the fourth quarter of
    2008, which was recorded within “Other, net” in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of operations.

Net revenues decreased 6% in 2008 compared to 2007 due to the
    market conditions described above. On a comparable basis,
    operating income decreased 30% in 2008 compared to 2007,
    excluding the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible
    impairment charge, the CityCenter gain, insurance recoveries,
    property transactions, preopening and

start-up

expenses, and profits from The Signature. Our operating margin
    decreased to 15% from 22% in the prior year on a comparable
    basis. The 44% decrease in corporate expense in 2008 was mainly
    attributable to cost reduction efforts implemented throughout
    the year, including the elimination of annual bonuses due to not
    meeting internal profit targets. Also, corporate expense in the
    prior year included severance costs, costs associated with our
    CityCenter joint venture transaction, and development costs
    associated with our planned MGM Grand Atlantic City project.
    Depreciation and amortization expense increased 11% in 2008 on
    top of an 11% increase in 2007 due to the significant capital
    investments in our resorts over the past few years.

Excluding Beau Rivage, net revenues in 2007 increased 4% over
    2006, largely due to strength in hotel room rates and other
    non-gaming revenues. Operating income in 2007 compared to 2006
    decreased 5% on a comparable basis, excluding the CityCenter
    gain, Hurricane Katrina insurance recoveries, operations at Beau
    Rivage, profits from The Signature at MGM Grand, preopening and

start-up

expenses, and property transactions. The decrease in operating
    income in 2007 on a comparable basis mainly related to higher
    depreciation and amortization expense and higher corporate
    expense.

Table games revenue decreased 12% in 2008 mainly due to a
    decrease in volumes. The table games hold percentage was near
    the mid-point of the range for both years. In 2007, table games
    revenue decreased 7% excluding Beau Rivage, with volumes
    essentially flat and a slightly lower hold percentage in 2007.

Volume decreases mainly at our Las Vegas Strip resorts in 2008
    led to a 5% decrease in slots revenue. Slots revenue at Bellagio
    and Mandalay Bay decreased 4% while the majority of our other
    Las Vegas Strip resorts experienced year-over-year decreases in
    the low double digits. Slots revenue increased 7% at MGM Grand
    Detroit and 5% at Gold Strike Tunica. In 2007, slots revenue was
    flat, excluding Beau Rivage. Slots revenue was strong in 2007 at
    many of our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, including Bellagio and MGM
    Grand Las Vegas — each up 8% over 2006 — and
    The Mirage and Mandalay Bay — each up 5% over 2006.

Hotel revenue decreased 10% in 2008 due to decreased occupancy
    and lower average room rates leading to a 10% decrease in
    REVPAR. Average room rates decreased 7% at our Las Vegas Strip
    resorts with a decrease in occupancy from 96% to 93%. In 2007,
    hotel revenue increased 5% excluding Beau Rivage, with a 7%
    increase in company-wide REVPAR. Strength in demand and room
    pricing in 2007 on the Las Vegas Strip led to a 5% increase in
    ADR.

Food and beverage, entertainment, and retail revenues in 2008
    were all impacted by lower customer spending and decreased
    occupancy at our resorts. In 2007, increases in food and
    beverage revenue were a result of investments in new restaurants
    and nightclubs. In 2008, entertainment revenues benefited from
    the addition of

Believe

at Luxor. In 2007, entertainment
    revenues benefited from

Love

, the Beatles-themed Cirque
    du Soleil show at The Mirage, which opened July 2006. Other
    revenues from continuing operations in 2008 increased 18% mainly
    due to reimbursed cost from CityCenter recognized as other
    revenue with corresponding amounts recognized as other expense.

    and building assets of Primm Valley Golf Club. The 2008 period
    also includes demolition costs associated with various room
    remodel projects and a gain on the sale of an aircraft of
    $25 million. Insurance recoveries relate to the Monte Carlo
    fire in 2008 and Hurricane Katrina in 2007 and 2006. See further
    discussion in “Executive Overview” section.

Write-downs and impairments in 2007 included write-offs related
    to discontinued construction projects and a write-off of the
    carrying value of the Nevada Landing building assets due to its
    closure in March 2007. The 2007 period also includes demolition
    costs primarily related to the Mandalay Bay room remodel.

Write-downs and impairments in 2006 included $22 million
    related to the write-off of the tram connecting Bellagio and
    Monte Carlo, including the stations at both resorts, in
    preparation for construction of CityCenter. Other impairments
    related to assets being replaced in connection with several
    capital projects.

In 2008, gross interest costs decreased compared to 2007 mainly
    due to lower interest rates on our variable rate borrowings.
    Capitalized interest decreased in 2008 due to less capitalized
    interest related to CityCenter and cessation of capitalized
    interest related to our investment in MGM Grand Macau upon
    opening in November 2007. The amounts presented above exclude
    non-cash gross interest and corresponding capitalized interest
    related to our CityCenter delayed equity
    contribution — see Note 8 to the accompanying
    consolidated financial statements for further discussion.

Gross interest costs increased in 2007 compared to 2006 due to
    higher average debt balances during the year up until the
    significant reduction in debt in the fourth quarter resulting
    from the $2.47 billion received upon the close of the
    CityCenter joint venture transaction and the $1.2 billion
    received from our sale of common stock to Infinity World
    Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dubai World. Higher
    capitalized interest in 2007 resulted from the ongoing
    construction of CityCenter, MGM Grand Detroit, and MGM Grand
    Macau.

The write-down of goodwill in 2008, which is treated as a
    permanently non-deductible item in our federal income tax
    provision, caused us to incur a provision for income tax expense
    even though our pre-tax result was a loss for the year.
    Excluding the impact of the goodwill write-down, the effective
    tax rate from continuing operations for 2008 was 37.3%. This is
    higher than the 2007 rate due to the impact of the CityCenter
    transaction on the 2007 rate, which greatly minimized the impact
    of permanent and other tax items, and due to the deduction taken
    in 2007 for domestic production activities resulting primarily
    from the CityCenter transaction. The effective income tax rate
    in 2006 benefited from a reversal of tax reserves that were no
    longer required, primarily due to guidance issued by the
    Internal Revenue Service related to the deductibility of certain
    complimentaries.

Cash taxes were paid in 2008 despite the pre-tax operating loss
    due to the non-deductible goodwill write-down and cash taxes
    paid on the CityCenter gain in 2008. Since the CityCenter gain
    was realized in the fourth quarter of 2007, the associated
    income taxes were paid in 2008. Absent the cash taxes paid on
    the CityCenter gain, cash taxes were approximately
    $250 million less in 2008 than in 2007. In addition, cash
    taxes for 2007 were only slightly higher than 2006 despite
    significantly higher pre-tax income due to the deferral of taxes
    on the CityCenter gain into 2008.

Cash
    Flows — Operating Activities

Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in our
    operating income, excluding gains and losses from investing
    activities and net property transactions, since our business is
    primarily cash-based. Cash flow from operations decreased 26% in
    2008 partially due to a decrease in operating income. The 2008
    period also included a significant tax payment, approximately
    $300 million, relating to the 2007 CityCenter transaction.
    Cash flow from operations decreased 19% in 2007 over 2006, due
    in part to an additional $135 million of net cash outflows
    related to real estate under development expenditures partially
    offset by residential sales deposits when CityCenter was wholly
    owned.

At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we held cash and cash
    equivalents of $296 million and $416 million,
    respectively. We require a certain amount of cash on hand to
    operate our resorts. Beyond our cash on hand, we utilize a
    company-wide cash management system to minimize the amount of
    cash held in banks. Funds are swept from accounts at our resorts
    daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested
    overnight or are used to repay borrowings under our bank credit
    facilities.

In 2008, we and Dubai World each made loans to CityCenter of
    $500 million and equity contributions of $653 million.
    The insurance recoveries classified as investing cash flows
    relate to Monte Carlo in 2008 and Hurricane Katrina in 2007 and
    2006 as discussed earlier in the “Executive Overview”
    section.

In 2007, we received net proceeds of $579 million from the
    sale of the Primm Valley Resorts and the Laughlin Properties.
    Also in 2007, we purchased a $160 million convertible note
    issued by The M Resort LLC, which is developing a casino resort
    on Las Vegas Boulevard, 10 miles south of Bellagio. The
    note is convertible, with certain restrictions, into a 50%
    equity position in The M Resort LLC. Investments in
    unconsolidated affiliates in 2006 primarily represented
    investments in MGM Grand Macau.

Cash
    Flows — Financing Activities

We borrowed net debt of $2.4 billion in 2008, including
    $2.5 billion under our senior credit facility. Also in
    2008, we issued $750 million of 13% senior secured
    notes due 2013 at a discount to yield 15%. The senior secured
    notes require that upon consummation of an asset sale, such as
    the proposed sale of TI, we either a) reinvest the net
    after-tax proceeds, which can include committed capital
    expenditures; or b) make an offer to repurchase a
    corresponding amount of senior secured notes at par plus accrued
    interest. We repaid the following senior and senior subordinated
    notes at maturity during 2008:

•

$180.4 million of 6.75% senior notes; and

•

$196.2 million of 9.5% senior notes.

In October 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the purchase
    of up to $500 million of our public debt securities. In
    2008, we repurchased $345 million of principal amounts of
    our outstanding senior notes at a purchase price of
    $263 million in open market repurchases as follows:

•

$230 million of our 6% senior notes due 2009;

•

$43 million of our 8.5% senior notes due 2010;

•

$3.7 million of our 6.375% senior notes due 2011;

•

$5.4 million of our 6.75% senior notes due 2012;

•

$15.8 million of our 6.75% senior notes due 2013;

•

$16.1 million of our 5.875% senior notes due 2014;



•

$7.1 million of our 6.875% senior notes due 2016;

•

$17.3 million of our 7.5% senior notes due
    2016; and

•

$7 million of our 7.625% senior notes due 2017.

Also in the fourth quarter of 2008, we redeemed at par
    $149.4 million of the principal amount of our
    7% debentures due 2036 pursuant to a one-time put option by
    the holders of such debentures.

We repaid net debt of $1.8 billion in 2007, including
    $1.2 billion under our senior credit facility. In 2007, we
    issued $750 million of 7.5% senior notes maturing in
    2016 and we repaid the following senior and senior subordinated
    notes at their scheduled maturity: $710 million of
    9.75% senior subordinated notes; $200 million of
    6.75% senior notes; and $492.2 million of
    10.25% senior subordinated notes.

In 2007, we received approximately $1.2 billion from the
    sale of 14.2 million shares of our common stock to Infinity
    World Investments at a price of $84 per share. We received
    $14 million, $98 million and $89 million in
    proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options in the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In 2006, we borrowed net debt of $662 million, due to the
    level of capital expenditures, share repurchases and investments
    in unconsolidated affiliates. We repaid at their scheduled
    maturity our $200 million 6.45% senior notes and our
    $245 million 7.25% senior notes, and we issued
    $1.5 billion of senior notes at various times throughout
    the year, with interest rates ranging from 6.75% to 7.625% and
    maturities ranging from 2013 to 2017.

Our share repurchases are only conducted under repurchase
    programs approved by our Board of Directors and publicly
    announced. In May 2008, our Board of Directors approved a
    20 million share authorization which is still fully
    available at December 31, 2008. Our share repurchase

Principal
    Debt Arrangements

Our long-term debt consists of publicly held senior, senior
    secured, and senior subordinated notes and our senior credit
    facility. We pay fixed rates of interest ranging from 5.875% to
    13% on the senior, senior secured, and subordinated notes. We
    pay variable interest based on LIBOR or a base rate on our
    senior credit facility. Our current senior credit facility has a
    total capacity of $7.0 billion, matures in 2011, and
    consists of a $4.5 billion revolving credit facility and a
    $2.5 billion term loan facility. As of December 31,
    2008, we had approximately $1.2 billion of available
    liquidity under our senior credit facility. After giving effect
    to our February 2009 borrowing, we have borrowed the entire
    amount of available borrowings under the senior credit facility.

All of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of
    our material subsidiaries, excluding MGM Grand Detroit, LLC and
    our foreign subsidiaries. MGM Grand Detroit is a guarantor under
    the senior credit facility, but only to the extent that MGM
    Grand Detroit, LLC borrows under such facilities. At
    December 31, 2008, the outstanding amount of borrowings
    related to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC was $404 million.
    Substantially all of the assets of New York-New York serve as
    collateral for the 13% senior secured notes issued in 2008;
    otherwise, none of our assets serve as collateral for our
    principal debt arrangements.



Other
    Factors Affecting Liquidity

Amendment to senior credit facility.

In
    September 2008, we amended our senior credit facility to
    increase the maximum total leverage ratio (debt to EBITDA, as
    defined) to 7.5:1.0 beginning with the fiscal quarter ending
    December 31, 2008, which will remain in effect through
    December 31, 2009, with step downs thereafter. The
    amendment modified drawn and undrawn pricing levels as well as
    revised certain definitions and limitations on secured
    indebtedness. Our drawn pricing levels over LIBOR remain
    unchanged when the maximum total leverage ratio is less than
    5.0:1. When the maximum total leverage ratio exceeds that level,
    the drawn pricing levels over LIBOR range from 1.25% to 2.00%.

Request to borrow remaining available funds under the senior
    credit facility

.  In February 2009, we submitted a
    borrowing request for $842 million, the remaining amount of
    available funds (other than outstanding letters of credit) under
    our senior credit facility. The borrowing request was fully
    funded as of February 26, 2009. For further discussion of
    this event and its impact on our liquidity and financial
    position, see “Executive Overview — Liquidity and
    Financial Position.”

Long-term debt payable in 2009.

We have
    $226 million of principal of senior notes due in July 2009
    and $820 million of principal of senior notes due in
    October 2009.

Sale of TI.

In December 2008, we entered into
    a purchase agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to sell TI
    to Ruffin Acquisition, LLC (“Ruffin Acquisition”) for
    a purchase price of $775 million. The purchase price is to
    be paid at closing as follows: $500 million in cash and
    $275 million in secured notes bearing interest at 10%, with
    $100 million payable not later than 175 days after
    closing and $175 million payable not later than
    24 months after closing. The notes, to be issued by Ruffin
    Acquisition, will be secured by the assets of TI and will be
    senior to any other financing. In March 2009, we entered into an
    amendment to the purchase agreement which a) extends the
    maturity of the $175 million note to 36 months, and
    b) offers Ruffin Acquisition a $20 million discount on
    the purchase price effected through a reduction in principal of
    the notes if they are paid in full by April 30, 2009. The
    transaction is subject to customary closing conditions contained
    in the purchase agreement, including receipt of all gaming and
    other regulatory approvals. In addition, the ability of Ruffin
    Acquisition to obtain financing is not a closing condition. We
    anticipate that the transaction will be completed by
    March 31, 2009, and we expect to report a substantial gain
    on the sale. Under the terms of our 13% senior secured
    notes, within 360 days of the receipt of the proceeds from
    the TI sale we must either invest such proceeds in qualifying
    investments, which includes capital expenditures, or offer to
    repurchase the senior notes at par.

MGM Grand Atlantic City development.

In
    October 2007, we announced plans for a multi-billion dollar
    resort complex on our

72-acre

site
    in Atlantic City. Since making that announcement, we have made
    extensive progress in design and other pre-development
    activities. However, current economic conditions, including
    limited access to capital markets for projects of this scale
    have caused us to reassess timing for this project. Accordingly,
    we have postponed current development activities.

Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation.

We have
    entered into a series of agreements to implement a strategic
    alliance with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation
    (“MPTN”), which owns and operates Foxwoods Casino
    Resort in Mashantucket, Connecticut. Under the strategic
    alliance, a new casino resort owned and operated by MPTN located
    adjacent to the existing Foxwoods casino resort carries the
    “MGM Grand” brand name. The resort opened in May 2008.
    We are receiving a brand licensing and consulting fee in
    connection with this agreement. We have also formed a jointly
    owned company with MPTN — Unity Gaming,
    LLC — to acquire or develop future gaming and
    non-gaming enterprises. Under certain circumstances, we will
    provide a loan of up to $200 million to finance a portion
    of MPTN’s investment in joint projects.

Kerzner/Istithmar joint venture.

In September
    2007, we entered into a definitive agreement with Kerzner
    International and Istithmar forming a joint venture to develop a
    multi-billion dollar integrated resort to be located on the
    southwest corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara Avenue. In
    September 2008, we and our partners agreed to defer additional
    design and pre-construction activities and amended the joint
    venture agreement accordingly. In the event the joint venture
    partners agree that the resort will be developed, we will
    contribute 40 acres of land, valued at $20 million per
    acre, for fifty percent of the equity in the joint venture.
    Kerzner International and Istithmar will contribute cash
    totaling $600 million, of which $200 million will be
    distributed to us, for the other 50% of the equity.



Off
    Balance Sheet Arrangements

Investments in unconsolidated affiliates.

Our
    off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of investments
    in unconsolidated affiliates, which currently consist primarily
    of our investments in CityCenter, Borgata, Grand Victoria,
    Silver Legacy, and MGM Grand Macau. We have not entered into any
    transactions with special purpose entities, nor have we engaged
    in any derivative transactions. Our unconsolidated affiliate
    investments allow us to realize the proportionate benefits of
    owning a full-scale resort in a manner that minimizes our
    initial investment. We have not historically guaranteed
    financing obtained by our investees, and there are no other
    provisions of the venture agreements which we believe are
    unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be
    subjected if we had full ownership of the resort.

CityCenter.

In October 2008, CityCenter closed
    on a $1.8 billion senior secured bank credit facility. The
    credit facility can be increased up to $3 billion and
    consists of a $250 million revolver with the remaining
    amount being in the form of term loans. The credit facility
    matures in April 2013 and is secured by substantially all of the
    assets of CityCenter. The credit facility is initially priced at
    LIBOR plus 3.75% through the construction period.

Through December 31, 2008, we and Infinity World had each
    made loans of $925 million to CityCenter, which are
    subordinate to the credit facility. During the fourth quarter of
    2008, $425 million of each partner’s loan funding was
    converted to equity and each partner provided equity
    contributions of $228 million. Under the terms of the
    credit facility, we and Infinity World were each required to
    fund future construction costs through equity commitments of up
    to $731 million as of December 31, 2008, which
    requirement would be reduced by future qualifying financing
    obtained by CityCenter. Subsequent to December 31, 2008,
    each partner made an additional $237 million of required
    equity contributions. The proceeds from the subordinated loans
    and equity contributions will be used to fund construction costs
    prior to accessing borrowings under the credit facility.

In conjunction with the CityCenter credit facility, we and
    Infinity World have entered into partial completion guarantees
    on a several basis. The partial completion guarantees provide
    for additional funding of construction costs in the event such
    funding is necessary to complete the project, up to a maximum
    amount of $600 million each.

Letters of credit.

At December 31, 2008,
    we had outstanding letters of credit totaling $92 million,
    of which $50 million support bonds issued by the Economic
    Development Corporation of the City of Detroit and maturing in
    2009. These bonds are recorded as a liability in our
    consolidated balance sheets. This obligation was undertaken to
    secure our right to develop a permanent casino in Detroit.

See “Executive Overview — Liquidity and Financial
    Position” for discussion of the impacts of the above
    contractual obligations on our liquidity and financial position.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

Management’s discussion and analysis of our results of
    operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our
    consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated
    financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
    generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
    the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate
    these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we
    consider to be critical accounting estimates, where changes in
    the estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on
    our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
    Senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors have reviewed the disclosures included herein about
    our critical accounting estimates, and have reviewed the
    processes to determine those estimates.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Casino Accounts Receivable

Marker play represents a significant portion of the table games
    volume at Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay and The
    Mirage. Our other facilities do not emphasize marker play to the
    same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those
    casinos as well. We maintain strict controls over the issuance
    of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those
    customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These
    collection efforts are similar to those used by most large
    corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts,
    including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices,
    personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and
    civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable
    instruments in the United States. At December 31, 2008 and
    2007, approximately 52% and 47%, respectively, of our casino
    accounts receivable was owed by customers from the United
    States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some
    foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign
    customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the
    United States. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, approximately
    34% and 38%, respectively, of our casino accounts receivable was
    owed by customers from the Far East.

We maintain an allowance, or reserve, for doubtful casino
    accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision
    for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the
    allowance for doubtful accounts. We regularly evaluate the
    allowance for doubtful casino accounts. At resorts where marker
    play is not significant, the allowance is generally established
    by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account
    balances. At resorts where marker play is significant, we apply
    standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a
    specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the
    collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified
    dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the
    customer’s financial condition, collection history and any
    other known information. We also monitor regional and global
    economic conditions and forecasts to determine if reserve levels
    are adequate.



The collectibility of unpaid markers is affected by a number of
    factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and
    economic conditions in the customers’ home countries.
    Because individual customer account balances can be significant,
    the allowance and the provision can change significantly between
    periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known
    or as changes in a region’s economy occur.

The following table shows key statistics related to our casino
    receivables:

The allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of casino
    accounts receivable has increased in the current year due to an
    increase in aging of accounts. At December 31, 2008, a 100
    basis-point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts as a
    percentage of casino accounts receivable would change net income
    by $2 million, or less than $0.01 per share.

Fixed
    Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies

Property and equipment are stated at cost. For the majority of
    our property and equipment, cost has been determined based on
    estimated fair values in connection with the April 2005 Mandalay
    acquisition and the May 2000 Mirage Resorts acquisition.
    Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value
    of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to
    expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided
    on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the
    assets. We account for construction projects in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 67,
    “Accounting for Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real
    Estate Projects.” When we construct assets, we capitalize
    direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects
    and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design
    and construction subsidiaries.

We must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for
    capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a
    maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment.
    When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine
    whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise
    impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. Our
    depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we
    make about our assets’ estimated useful lives. We determine
    the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar
    assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of
    the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change
    the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change
    prospectively.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 34, “Capitalization of Interest Cost”
    (“SFAS 34”), interest cost associated with major
    development and construction projects is capitalized as part of
    the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on
    amounts expended on the project using the weighted-average cost
    of our outstanding borrowings, since we typically do not borrow
    funds directly related to a development project. Capitalization
    of interest starts when construction activities, as defined in
    SFAS 34, begin and ceases when construction is
    substantially complete or development activity is suspended for
    more than a brief period.

Impairment
    of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible
    Assets

We evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived
    assets for impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting for the
    Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For assets to
    be disposed of, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying
    value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated
    based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a
    discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we
    review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist.
    We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on
    an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If
    the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no
    impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not
    exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based
    on the fair value of the asset, typically



measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is
    still under development, future cash flows include remaining
    construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether
    for assets to be disposed of or assets to be held and used, are
    recorded as operating expenses.

There are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in
    measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management
    must determine the usage of the asset. To the extent management
    decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an
    impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the
    lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means
    that some assets must be grouped, and management has some
    discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates
    are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ
    materially from our estimates.

On a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to
    determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that
    indicate a potential impairment. We estimate future cash flows
    using our internal budgets. When appropriate, we discount future
    cash flows using our weighted-average cost of capital, developed
    using a standard capital asset pricing model.

We review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for
    impairment in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.” Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price
    over fair market value of net assets acquired in business
    combinations. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
    must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between
    annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our
    annual impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived
    intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.
    Goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment
    using a discounted cash flow analysis based on our budgeted
    future results discounted using our weighted average cost of
    capital and market indicators of terminal year capitalization
    rates. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of
    license rights, which are tested for impairment using a
    discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks; which are tested
    for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. See
    Note 3 and Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated
    financial statements for further discussion related to goodwill
    and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

There are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets
    for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are,
    by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ
    materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of
    capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the goodwill
    impairment test are highly judgmental and dependent in large
    part on expectations of future market conditions.

See “Results of Operations” for discussion of
    write-downs and impairments of long-lived assets recorded in
    2008, 2007 and 2006. In 2006, we entered into agreements to sell
    Primm Valley Resorts and Laughlin Properties. The fair value
    less costs to sell exceeded the carrying value, therefore no
    impairment was indicated. See “Goodwill Impairment”
    for discussion of impairment of goodwill recorded in 2008. Other
    than the above items, we are not aware of events or
    circumstances through December 31, 2008 that would cause us
    to review any material long-lived assets, goodwill or
    indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment.

Income
    Taxes

We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, “Accounting
    for Income Taxes” (“SFAS 109”).
    SFAS 109 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets,
    net of applicable reserves, related to net operating loss
    carryforwards and certain temporary differences. The standard
    requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that
    realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise,
    a valuation allowance is applied. Except for certain New Jersey
    state net operating losses, certain other New Jersey state
    deferred tax assets, a foreign tax credit carryforward and
    certain foreign deferred tax assets, we believe that it is more
    likely than not that our deferred tax assets are fully
    realizable because of the future reversal of existing taxable
    temporary differences and future projected taxable income.

Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the
    Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax
    authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes
    subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be
    accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities.

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an Interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”).
    FIN 48 requires



that tax positions be assessed using a two-step process. A tax
    position is recognized if it meets a “more likely than
    not” threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of
    benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being
    realized. As required by the standard, we review uncertain tax
    positions at each balance sheet date. Liabilities we record as a
    result of this analysis are recorded separately from any current
    or deferred income tax accounts, and are classified as current
    (“Other accrued liabilities”) or long-term
    (“Other long-term liabilities”) based on the time
    until expected payment. Additionally, we recognize accrued
    interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in
    income tax expense, a policy that did not change as a result of
    the adoption of FIN 48.

We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal
    jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign
    jurisdictions, although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions
    are not material. As of December 31, 2008, we were no
    longer subject to examination of our U.S. federal income
    tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2003. While the IRS
    examination of the 2001 and 2002 tax years closed during the
    first quarter of 2007, the statute of limitations for assessing
    tax for such years has been extended in order for us to appeal
    issues related to a land sale transaction that were not agreed
    upon at the closure of the examination. The appeals discussions
    continue, and the Company has requested to enter into appeals
    mediation procedures with the IRS. Consequently, we believe that
    it is reasonably possible to settle these issues within the next
    twelve months. The IRS is currently examining our federal income
    tax returns for the 2003 and 2004 tax years and one of our
    subsidiaries for the 2004 through 2006 tax years. Tax returns
    for subsequent years are also subject to examination. In
    addition, during the first quarter of 2009, the IRS initiated an
    examination of the federal income tax return of Mandalay Resort
    Group for the pre-acquisition year ended April 25, 2005.
    The statute of limitations for assessing tax for the Mandalay
    Resort Group federal income tax return for the year ended
    January 31, 2005 has been extended but such return is not
    currently under examination by the IRS.

As of December 31, 2008, we are no longer subject to
    examination for our various state and local tax returns filed
    for years ended prior to 2003. A Mandalay Resort Group
    subsidiary return for the pre-acquisition year ended
    April 25, 2005 is under examination by the City of Detroit.
    During the first quarter of 2008, the state of Mississippi
    settled an examination of returns filed by subsidiaries of MGM
    MIRAGE and Mandalay Resort Group for the 2004 through 2006 tax
    years. This settlement resulted in a payment of additional taxes
    and interest of less than $1 million. No other state or
    local income tax returns are currently under exam.

Stock-based
    Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with SFAS
    123(R). For stock options and stock appreciation rights
    (“SARs”) we measure fair value using the Black-Scholes
    model. For restricted stock units, compensation expense is
    calculated based on the fair market value of our stock on the
    date of grant. There are several management assumptions required
    to determine the inputs into the Black-Scholes model. Our
    volatility and expected term assumptions can significantly
    impact the fair value of stock options and SARs. The extent of
    the impact will depend, in part, on the extent of awards in any
    given year. In 2008, we granted 4.9 million SARs with a
    total fair value of $72 million. In 2007, we granted
    2.6 million SARs with a total fair value of
    $68 million. In 2006, we granted 1.9 million stock
    options and SARs with a total fair value of $28 million.

For 2008 awards, a 10% change in the volatility assumption (50%
    for 2008; for sensitivity analysis, volatility was assumed to be
    45% and 55%) would have resulted in a $5.5 million, or 8%,
    change in fair value. A 10% change in the expected term
    assumption (4.6 years for 2008; for sensitivity analysis,
    expected term was assumed to be 4.1 years and
    5.1 years) would have resulted in a $3.3 million, or
    5%, change in fair value. These changes in fair value would have
    been recognized over the five-year vesting period of such
    awards. It should be noted that a change in the expected term
    would cause other changes, since the risk-free rate and
    volatility assumptions are specific to the term; we did not
    attempt to adjust those assumptions in performing the
    sensitivity analysis above.



Recently
    Issued Accounting Standards

Accounting
    for Business Combinations and Non-Controlling
    Interests

In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 141(R),
    “Business Combinations,” (“SFAS 141R”) and
    SFAS No. 160 “Non-controlling interests in
    Consolidated Financial Statements — an amendment of
    ARB No. 51,” (“SFAS 160”). These
    standards amend the requirements for accounting for business
    combinations, including the recognition and measurement of
    additional assets and liabilities at their fair value, expensing
    of acquisition-related costs which are currently capitalizable
    under existing rules, treatment of adjustments to deferred taxes
    and liabilities subsequent to the measurement period, and the
    measurement of non-controlling interests, previously commonly
    referred to as minority interests, at fair value. SFAS 141R
    also includes additional disclosure requirements with respect to
    the methodologies and techniques used to determine the fair
    value of assets and liabilities recognized in a business
    combination. SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 apply
    prospectively to fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, except for the treatment of deferred tax
    adjustments which apply to deferred taxes recognized in previous
    business combinations. These standards became effective for us
    on January 1, 2009. We do not believe the adoption of
    SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 will have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

Transfers
    of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable Entities

In December 2008, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8 “Disclosures by Public Entities
    (Enterprises) About Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests
    in Variable Interest Entities.” The FSP enhances
    disclosures required by FIN 46(R) to include a discussion
    of significant judgments made in determining whether a variable
    interest entity (“VIE”) should be consolidated, as
    well as the nature of the risks and how its involvement with a
    VIE affects the financial position of the entity. The FSP is
    effective for us for the fiscal year ended December 31,
    2008. The adoption of the FSP did not have a material impact on
    our consolidated financial statements.

Equity
    Method Investment Accounting Considerations

In November 2008, the Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) of the FASB ratified its consensus on EITF

No. 08-6”).

The EITF reached a consensus on the following four issues
    addressed: a) the initial carrying value of an equity
    method investment is determined in accordance with
    SFAS 141(R); b) equity method investors should not
    separately test an investee’s underlying assets for
    impairment, but rather recognize other than temporary
    impairments of an equity method investment in accordance with
    APB Opinion 18; c) exceptions to recognizing gains from an
    investee’s issuance of shares in earnings in accordance
    with the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 51 were
    removed to achieve consistency with SFAS 160; and
    d) the guidance in APB Opinion 18 to account for a change
    in the investor’s accounting from the equity method to the
    cost method should still be applied.

EITF 08-6

became effective for us on January 1, 2009. We do not
    believe the adoption of

EITF 08-6

will have a material impact on our consolidated financial
    statements.

Market
    Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in
    market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign
    currency exchange rates and commodity prices. Our primary
    exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with
    our long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest
    rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate
    borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit
    facilities.

As of December 31, 2008, long-term fixed rate borrowings
    represented approximately 58% of our total borrowings. Based on
    December 31, 2008 debt levels, an assumed 100 basis-point
    change in LIBOR would cause our annual interest cost to change
    by approximately $57 million.

MANAGEMENT’S
    ANNUAL REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management’s
    Responsibilities

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting for MGM
    MIRAGE and subsidiaries (the “Company”).

Objective
    of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

In establishing adequate internal control over financial
    reporting, management has developed and maintained a system of
    internal control, policies and procedures designed to provide
    reasonable assurance that information contained in the
    accompanying consolidated financial statements and other
    information presented in this annual report is reliable, does
    not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
    state a material fact, and fairly presents in all material
    respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash
    flows of the Company as of and for the periods presented in this
    annual report. Significant elements of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting include, for example:

•

Hiring skilled accounting personnel and training them
    appropriately;

•

Written accounting policies;

•

Written documentation of accounting systems and procedures;

•

Segregation of incompatible duties;

•

Internal audit function to monitor the effectiveness of the
    system of internal control;

•

Oversight by an independent Audit Committee of the Board of
    Directors.

Management’s
    Evaluation

Management has evaluated the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting using the criteria established in
    Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. Based on its evaluation as of December 31,
    2008, management believes that the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is effective in achieving the
    objectives described above.

Report of
    Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Deloitte & Touche LLP audited the Company’s
    consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2008 and issued their report thereon, which is
    included in this annual report. Deloitte & Touche LLP
    has also issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of
    the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and
    such report is also included in this annual report.



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM MIRAGE

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    MGM MIRAGE and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion
    on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008.
    Our report dated March 17, 2009 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
    schedule and included (a) an explanatory paragraph
    expressing substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to
    continue as a going concern; and (b) an explanatory
    paragraph regarding the adoption of Financial Accounting
    Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for
    Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an interpretation of
    FASB Statement No. 109.

Las Vegas, Nevada

March 17, 2009



REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders

of MGM MIRAGE

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    MGM MIRAGE and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash
    flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included
    in Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and financial
    statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of MGM
    MIRAGE and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2008 and 2007,
    and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
    each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
    2008, in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion,
    such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation
    to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been
    prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going
    concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company believes it will not be in
    compliance with the financial covenants under its senior credit
    facility during 2009 and there is uncertainty regarding the
    Company’s ability to fulfill its financial commitments as
    they become due. These conditions raise substantial doubt about
    the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
    Management’s plans concerning these matters are also
    discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial
    statements. The consolidated financial statements do not include
    any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this
    uncertainty.

As discussed in Note 12 to the consolidated financial
    statements, on January 1, 2007, the Company adopted the
    provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes — an interpretation of FASB Statement No.

.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated March 17, 2009 expressed an

MGM
    MIRAGE AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 —

ORGANIZATION

MGM MIRAGE (the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation,
    incorporated on January 29, 1986. As of December 31,
    2008, approximately 54% of the outstanding shares of the
    Company’s common stock were owned by Tracinda Corporation,
    a Nevada corporation wholly owned by Kirk Kerkorian. As a
    result, Tracinda Corporation has the ability to elect the
    Company’s entire Board of Directors and determine the
    outcome of other matters submitted to the Company’s
    stockholders, such as the approval of significant transactions.
    MGM MIRAGE acts largely as a holding company and, through
    wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns

and/or

operates casino resorts.

The Company owns and operates the following casino resorts in
    Las Vegas, Nevada: Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay,
    The Mirage, Luxor, Treasure Island (“TI”), New
    York-New York, Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Circus Circus Las Vegas
    and

Slots-A-Fun.

Operations at MGM Grand Las Vegas include management of The
    Signature at MGM Grand Las Vegas, a condominium-hotel consisting
    of three towers. Other Nevada operations include Circus Circus
    Reno, Gold Strike in Jean, and Railroad Pass in Henderson. The
    Company has a 50% investment in Silver Legacy in Reno, which is
    adjacent to Circus Circus Reno. The Company also owns Shadow
    Creek, an exclusive world-class golf course located
    approximately ten miles north of its Las Vegas Strip resorts,
    and Primm Valley Golf Club at the California/Nevada state line.

In December 2008, the Company entered into an agreement to sell
    TI for $775 million; the sale is expected to close by
    March 31, 2009. In April 2007, the Company completed the
    sale of Buffalo Bill’s, Primm Valley, and Whiskey
    Pete’s casino resorts (the “Primm Valley
    Resorts”), not including the Primm Valley Golf Club, with
    net proceeds to the Company of approximately $398 million.
    In June 2007, the Company completed the sale of the Colorado
    Belle and Edgewater in Laughlin (the “Laughlin
    Properties”), with net proceeds to the Company of
    approximately $199 million.

The Company is a 50% owner of CityCenter, a mixed-use
    development on the Las Vegas Strip, between Bellagio and Monte
    Carlo. CityCenter will feature a 4,000-room casino resort
    designed by world-famous architect Cesar Pelli; two 400-room
    non-gaming boutique hotels, one of which will be managed by
    luxury hotelier Mandarin Oriental; approximately
    425,000 square feet of retail shops, dining and
    entertainment venues; and approximately 2.1 million square
    feet of residential space in approximately 2,400 luxury
    condominium and condominium-hotel units in multiple towers.
    CityCenter is expected to open in late 2009, except CityCenter
    postponed the opening of The Harmon Hotel & Spa until
    late 2010 and cancelled the development of approximately 200
    residential units originally planned. The other 50% of
    CityCenter is owned by Infinity World Development Corp.
    (“Infinity World”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dubai
    World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates government decree entity.
    The Company is managing the development of CityCenter and, upon
    completion of construction, will manage the operations of
    CityCenter for a fee. Construction costs for the major
    components of CityCenter are covered by guaranteed maximum price
    contracts (“GMPs”) totaling $6.9 billion, which
    have been fully executed. Including the cancellation of The
    Harmon residential component, the Company anticipates total cost
    savings of approximately $0.5 billion which would reduce
    the $6.9 billion in GMP construction costs. In addition, by
    postponing The Harmon Hotel & Spa by one year the
    Company expects to defer $0.2 billion of construction costs
    necessary to complete the interior fit out. Additional budgeted
    cash expenditures include $1.8 billion of construction
    costs not included in the GMPs, $0.2 billion of preopening
    costs, and $0.3 billion of financing costs.

The Company and its local partners own and operate MGM Grand
    Detroit in Detroit, Michigan. The resort’s interim facility
    closed on September 30, 2007 and the new casino resort
    opened on October 2, 2007. The Company also owns and
    operates two resorts in Mississippi — Beau Rivage in
    Biloxi and Gold Strike Tunica. Beau Rivage reopened in August
    2006, after having been closed due to damage sustained as a
    result of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005.

The Company has 50% interests in three resorts outside of
    Nevada — MGM Grand Macau, Grand Victoria and Borgata.
    MGM Grand Macau is a casino resort that opened on
    December 18, 2007. Pansy Ho Chiu-King owns the



other 50% of MGM Grand Macau. Grand Victoria is a riverboat in
    Elgin, Illinois — an affiliate of Hyatt Gaming owns
    the other 50% of Grand Victoria and also operates the resort.
    Borgata is a casino resort located on Renaissance Pointe in the
    Marina area of Atlantic City, New Jersey. Boyd Gaming
    Corporation owns the other 50% of Borgata and also operates the
    resort.

The Company owns additional land adjacent to Borgata, a portion
    of which consists of common roads, landscaping and master plan
    improvements, a portion of which is being utilized for an
    expansion of Borgata, and a portion of which is planned for a
    wholly-owned development, MGM Grand Atlantic City. The Company
    has made extensive progress in design and other pre-development
    activities. However, current economic conditions and the impact
    of the credit market environment have caused the Company to
    reassess timing for this project. Accordingly, the Company has
    postponed additional development activities. The Company has
    also postponed further design and pre-construction activities
    for its planned North Las Vegas Strip project with Kerzner
    International and Istithmar — see Note 13 for
    further discussion.

NOTE 2 —
    LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL POSITION

The Company has significant indebtedness and significant
    financial commitments in 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the
    Company had approximately $13.5 billion of total long-term
    debt. In late February 2009, the Company borrowed
    $842 million under the senior credit facility, which amount
    represented — after giving effect to $93 million
    in outstanding letters of credit — the total amount of
    unused borrowing capacity available under its $7.0 billion
    senior credit facility. In connection with the waiver and
    amendment described below, on March 17, 2009 the Company
    repaid $300 million under the senior credit facility, which
    amount is not available for reborrowing without the consent of
    the lenders. The Company has no other existing sources of
    borrowing availability, except to the extent it pays down
    further amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility.

In addition to commitments under employment, entertainment and
    other operational agreements, the Company’s financial
    commitments and estimated capital expenditures in 2009, as of
    December 31, 2008, totaled approximately $2.8 billion
    and consisted of:

•

Contractual maturities of long-term debt totaling approximately
    $1.0 billion;

•

Interest payments on long-term debt, estimated at
    $0.8 billion;

•

CityCenter required equity contributions of approximately
    $0.7 billion;

•

Other commitments of approximately $0.3 billion, including
    $0.2 billion of estimated capital expenditures;

To fund its anticipated 2009 financial commitments, the Company
    has the following sources of funds in 2009:

•

Available borrowings under its senior credit facility of
    $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2008;

•

Expected proceeds in 2009 from the sale of TI of approximately
    $0.6 billion;

•

Operating cash flow: The Company’s current expectations for
    2009 indicate that operating cash flow will be lower than in
    2008. In 2008, the Company generated approximately
    $1.8 billion of cash flow from operations before deducting
    a) cash paid for interest, which commitments are included
    in the list above, and b) the tax payment on the 2007
    CityCenter transaction.

The Company is uncertain as to whether the sources listed above
    will be sufficient to fund our 2009 financial commitments and
    cannot provide any assurances that it will be able to raise
    additional capital to fund its anticipated expenditures in 2009
    if the sources listed above are not adequate.

While the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants
    under its senior credit facility at December 31, 2008, if
    the recent adverse conditions in the economy in
    general — and the gaming industry in
    particular — continue, the Company believes that it
    will not be in compliance with those financial covenants during
    2009. In fact, given these conditions and the recent borrowing
    under the senior credit facility, the Company does not believe
    it will be in compliance with those financial covenants at
    March 31, 2009. As a result, on March 17, 2009 the
    Company obtained from the lenders under the senior credit
    facility a waiver of the requirement that the Company comply
    with such financial covenants through May 15, 2009.
    Additionally, the Company entered into an amendment of its
    senior credit facility which provides for, among other terms,
    the following:

•

The Company agreed to repay $300 million of the outstanding
    borrowings under the senior credit facility, which amount is not
    available for reborrowing without the consent of the lenders;



•

The Company is prohibited from prepaying or repurchasing its
    outstanding long-term debt or disposing of material assets; and
    other restrictive covenants were added that limit the
    Company’s ability to make investments and incur
    indebtedness;

•

The interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the senior
    credit facility was increased by 100 basis points; and

•

The Company’s required equity contributions in CityCenter
    are limited through May 15, 2009 such that it can only make
    contributions if Infinity World makes its required
    contributions; the Company’s equity contributions do not
    exceed specified amounts (though the Company believes the
    limitation is in excess of the amounts expected to be required
    through May 15, 2009); and the CityCenter senior secured
    credit facility has not been accelerated.

Following expiration of the waiver on May 15, 2009, the
    Company will be subject to an event of default related to the
    expected noncompliance with financial covenants under the senior
    credit facility at March 31, 2009. Under the terms of the
    senior credit facility, noncompliance with such financial
    covenants is an event of default, under which the lenders (with
    a vote of more than 50% of the lenders) may exercise any or all
    of the following remedies:

•

Terminate their commitments to fund additional borrowings;

•

Require cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit;

•

Demand immediate repayment of all outstanding borrowings under
    the senior credit facility.

•

Decline to release subsidiary guarantees, which would impact the
    Company’s ability to execute asset dispositions.

In addition, there are provisions in certain of the
    Company’s indentures governing its senior and senior
    subordinated notes under which a) the event of default
    under the senior secured credit facility, or b) the
    remedies under an event of default under the senior credit
    facility, would cause an event of default under the relevant
    senior and senior subordinated notes, which would allow holders
    of the Company’s senior and senior subordinated notes to
    demand immediate repayment and decline to release subsidiary
    guarantees. Also, under the terms of the CityCenter senior
    secured credit facility, if an event of default has occurred
    under the Company’s borrowings and a) such event of
    default is certified to in writing by the relevant lenders, and
    b) such default allows the relevant lenders to demand
    immediate repayment, then an event of default has occurred
    relative to the CityCenter senior secured credit facility. Under
    such event of default, one of the remedies is the termination of
    the CityCenter senior secured credit facility. If the lenders
    exercise any or all such rights, the Company or CityCenter may
    determine to seek relief through a filing under the
    U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

The conditions and events described above raise a substantial
    doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going
    concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do
    not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
    effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or
    the amounts and classifications of liabilities that may result
    should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
    Management’s plans in regard to these matters are described
    below.

The Company intends to work with its lenders to obtain
    additional waivers or amendments prior to May 15, 2009 to
    address future noncompliance with the senior credit facility;
    however, the Company can provide no assurance that it will be
    able to secure such waivers or amendments.

The Company has also retained the services of outside advisors
    to assist the Company in instituting and implementing any
    required programs to accomplish management’s objectives.
    The Company is evaluating the possibility of a) disposing
    of certain assets, b) raising additional debt

and/or

equity capital, and c) modifying or extending its long-term
    debt. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will
    be successful in achieving its objectives.

NOTE 3 —

SIGNIFICANT
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

Principles of consolidation.

The consolidated
    financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its
    subsidiaries. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates which are
    50% or less owned and do not meet the consolidation criteria of
    Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation
    No. 46(R) (as amended), “Consolidation of Variable
    Interest Entities — an Interpretation of ARB
    No. 51” (“FIN 46(R)”), are accounted
    for under the



equity method. All significant intercompany balances and
    transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The
    Company’s operations are primarily in one
    segment — operation of casino resorts. Other
    operations, and foreign operations, are not material.

Management’s use of estimates.

The
    consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Those principles require the
    Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that
    affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
    disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
    the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues
    and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could
    differ from those estimates.

Financial statement impact of Hurricane Katrina and Monte
    Carlo fire.

The Company maintains insurance for
    both property damage and business interruption relating to
    catastrophic events, such as Hurricane Katrina affecting Beau
    Rivage in August 2005 and the rooftop fire at Monte Carlo in
    January 2008. Business interruption coverage covers lost profits
    and other costs incurred during the closure period and up to six
    months following re-opening.

Non-refundable insurance recoveries received in excess of the
    net book value of damaged assets,

clean-up

and
    demolition costs, and post-event costs are recognized as income
    in the period received or committed based on the Company’s
    estimate of the total claim for property damage (recorded as
    “Property transactions, net”) and business
    interruption (recorded as a reduction of “General and
    administrative” expenses) compared to the recoveries
    received at that time. All post-event costs and expected
    recoveries are recorded net within “General and
    administrative” expenses, except for depreciation of
    non-damaged assets, which is classified as “Depreciation
    and amortization.”

Insurance recoveries are classified in the statement of cash
    flows based on the coverage to which they relate. Recoveries
    related to business interruption are classified as operating
    cash flows and recoveries related to property damage are
    classified as investing cash flows. However, the Company’s
    insurance policy includes undifferentiated coverage for both
    property damage and business interruption. Therefore, the
    Company classifies insurance recoveries as being related to
    property damage until the full amount of damaged assets and
    demolition costs are recovered, and classifies additional
    recoveries up to the amount of post-event costs incurred as
    being related to business interruption. Insurance recoveries
    beyond that amount are classified as operating or investing cash
    flows based on the Company’s estimated allocation of the
    total claim.

The following table shows the net pre-tax impact on the
    statements of operations for insurance recoveries from Hurricane
    Katrina and the Monte Carlo fire:

Hurricane Katrina.

The Company reached final
    settlement agreements with its insurance carriers related to
    Hurricane Katrina in late 2007. In total, the Company received
    insurance recoveries of $635 million, which exceeded the
    $265 million net book value of damaged assets and
    post-storm costs incurred. The Company recognized the
    $370 million of excess insurance recoveries in income in
    2007 and 2008.

Monte Carlo fire.

As of December 31,
    2008, the Company received $50 million of proceeds from its
    insurance carriers related to the Monte Carlo fire. Through
    December 31, 2008, the Company recorded a write-down of
    $4 million related to the net book value of damaged assets,
    demolition costs of $7 million, and operating costs of
    $21 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company had
    a receivable of approximately $1 million from its insurance
    carriers.

Cash and cash equivalents.

Cash and cash
    equivalents include investments and interest bearing instruments
    with maturities of three months or less at the date of
    acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost which
    approximates market value. Book overdraft balances resulting
    from the Company’s cash management program are recorded as
    accounts payable, construction payable, or other accrued
    liabilities, as applicable.

Accounts receivable and credit risk.

Financial
    instruments that potentially subject the Company to
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of casino
    accounts receivable. The Company issues markers to approved
    casino customers following background checks and investigations
    of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2008, a substantial
    portion of the Company’s receivables were due from
    customers residing in foreign countries. Business or economic
    conditions or other significant events in these countries could
    affect the collectibility of such receivables.

Trade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are
    typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at
    cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account
    to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written
    off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for
    doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company’s
    receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair
    value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of
    customer accounts as well as historical collection experience
    and current economic and business conditions. Management
    believes that as of December 31, 2008, no significant
    concentrations of credit risk existed for which an allowance had
    not already been recorded.

Real estate under development.

Until November
    2007, the Company capitalized costs of wholly-owned real estate
    projects to be sold, which consisted entirely of condominium and
    condominium-hotel developments at CityCenter. Subsequent to the
    contribution of CityCenter to a joint venture — See
    Note 5 — the Company no longer has real estate
    under development.

Inventories.

Inventories consist of food and
    beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are
    stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined
    primarily by the average cost method for food and beverage and
    supplies and the retail inventory or specific identification
    methods for retail merchandise.

Property and equipment.

Property and equipment
    are stated at cost. Gains or losses on dispositions of property
    and equipment are included in the determination of income.
    Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Property and
    equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated
    useful lives on a straight-line basis:

Buildings and improvements

30 to 45 years

Land improvements

10 to 20 years

Furniture and fixtures

3 to 10 years

Equipment

3 to 20 years

The Company evaluates its property and equipment and other
    long-lived assets for impairment in accordance with the
    Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Statement of
    Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, “Accounting
    for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.” For
    assets to be disposed of, the Company recognizes the asset to be
    sold at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less
    costs of disposal. Fair value for assets to be disposed of is
    estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a
    discounted cash flow model.

For assets to be held and used, the Company reviews fixed assets
    for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. If an
    indicator of impairment exists, the Company compares the
    estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted
    basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted
    cash flows exceed the carrying



value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash
    flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is
    measured based on estimated fair value compared to carrying
    value, with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow
    model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows
    include remaining construction costs.

During the third quarter of 2008, the Company concluded that the
    Primm Valley Golf Club (“PVGC”) should be reviewed for
    impairment due to its recent operating losses and the
    Company’s expectation that such operating losses will
    continue. The estimated future undiscounted cash flows of PVGC
    do not exceed its carrying value. The Company determined the
    estimated fair value of PVGC to be approximately
    $14 million based on the comparable sales approach. The
    carrying value of PVGC exceeds its estimated fair value and as a
    result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of
    $30 million which is included in “Property
    transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of operations for the year ended December 31,
    2008. For a discussion of recognized impairment losses, see
    Note 17.

Capitalized interest.

The interest cost
    associated with major development and construction projects is
    capitalized and included in the cost of the project. When no
    debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is
    capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the
    weighted-average cost of the Company’s outstanding
    borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project
    is substantially complete or development activity is suspended
    for more than a brief period.

Investment in The M Resort LLC convertible
    note.

In June 2007, the Company purchased a
    $160 million convertible note issued by The M Resort LLC,
    which is developing a casino resort on Las Vegas Boulevard,
    10 miles south of Bellagio. The convertible note matures in
    June 2015, contains certain optional and mandatory redemption
    provisions, and is convertible into a 50% equity interest in The
    M Resort LLC beginning in December 2008. The convertible note
    earns interest at 6% which may be paid in cash or accrued
    “in kind” for the first five years; thereafter
    interest must be paid in cash. There are no scheduled principal
    payments before maturity.

The convertible note is accounted for as a hybrid financial
    instrument consisting of a host debt instrument and an embedded
    call option on The M Resort LLC’s equity. The debt
    component is accounted for separately as an available-for-sale
    marketable security, with changes in value recorded in other
    comprehensive income. The call option is treated as a derivative
    with changes in value recorded in earnings. The initial value of
    the call option was $0 and the initial value of the debt was
    $155 million, with the discount accreted to earnings over
    the term of the note. The fair value of the call option was $0
    at December 31, 2008 and 2007. The entire carrying value of
    the convertible note is included in “Deposits and other
    assets, net” in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets.

Investments in and advances to unconsolidated
    affiliates.

The Company has investments in
    unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method.
    Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the
    Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses,
    as well as capital contributions to and distributions from these
    companies.

The Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated
    affiliates for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such
    investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline
    in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the
    estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to
    determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether
    such impairment is other-than-temporary based on its assessment
    of all relevant factors. Estimated fair value is determined
    using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future
    results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year
    capitalization rates.

Goodwill and other intangible assets.

Goodwill
    represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value
    of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for
    impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in
    certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual
    impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. No
    impairments were indicated as a result of the annual impairment
    review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in
    2007 and 2006. See Note 9 for results of our 2008 annual
    impairment tests.

Goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment
    using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated
    future results of the Company’s reporting units discounted
    using the Company’s weighted average



cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year
    capitalization rates. The implied fair value of a reporting
    units goodwill is compared to the carrying value of that
    goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by
    allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets
    and liabilities and the amount remaining, if any, is the implied
    fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of the
    goodwill is less than its carrying value then it must be written
    down to its implied fair value. License rights are tested for
    impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks
    are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method.
    If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is
    less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss must be
    recognized equal to the difference.

Revenue recognition and promotional
    allowances.

Casino revenue is the aggregate net
    difference between gaming wins and losses, with liabilities
    recognized for funds deposited by customers before gaming play
    occurs (“casino front money”) and for chips in the
    customers’ possession (“outstanding chip
    liability”). Hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and
    other operating revenues are recognized as services are
    performed. Advance deposits on rooms and advance ticket sales
    are recorded as accrued liabilities until services are provided
    to the customer.

Gaming revenues are recognized net of certain sales incentives,
    including discounts and points earned in point-loyalty programs.
    The retail value of accommodations, food and beverage, and other
    services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross
    revenue and then deducted as promotional allowances. The
    estimated cost of providing such promotional allowances is
    primarily included in casino expenses as follows:

Reimbursed expenses.

The Company recognizes
    costs reimbursed pursuant to management services as revenue in
    the period it incurs the costs. Reimbursed costs related mainly
    to the Company’s management of CityCenter and totaled
    $47 million for 2008 and $5 million for 2007, and are
    classified as other revenue and other operating expenses in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations.

Point-loyalty programs.

The Company’s
    primary point-loyalty program, in operation at its major
    resorts, is Players Club. In Players Club, customers earn points
    based on their slots play, which can be redeemed for cash or
    free play at any of the Company’s participating resorts.
    The Company records a liability based on the points earned times
    the redemption value and records a corresponding reduction in
    casino revenue. The expiration of unused points results in a
    reduction of the liability. Customers’ overall level of
    table games and slots play is also tracked and used by
    management in awarding discretionary complimentaries –
    free rooms, food and beverage and other services – for
    which no accrual is recorded. Other loyalty programs at the
    Company’s resorts generally operate in a similar manner,
    though they generally are available only to customers at the
    individual resorts. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    total company-wide liability for point-loyalty programs was
    $52 million and $56 million, respectively, including
    amounts classified as liabilities related to assets held for
    sale.

Advertising.

The Company expenses advertising
    costs the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising
    expense of continuing operations, which is generally included in
    general and administrative expenses, was $122 million,
    $141 million and $119 million for 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Corporate expense.

Corporate expense
    represents unallocated payroll and aircraft costs, professional
    fees and various other expenses not directly related to the
    Company’s casino resort operations. In addition, corporate
    expense includes the costs associated with the Company’s
    evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, which are
    expensed as incurred until development of a specific project has
    become probable.

Preopening and

start-up

The Company accounts for costs incurred
    during the preopening and

start-up

phases of operations in accordance with the American Institute
    of Certified Public Accountants’ (“AICPA”)
    Statement of Position

organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified
    as preopening and

start-up

expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and
    other expenses related to new or

start-up

operations and new customer initiatives.

Property transactions, net.

The Company
    classifies transactions related to long-lived assets –
    such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and
    normal gains and losses on the sale of fixed assets –
    as “Property transactions, net” in the accompanying
    consolidated statements of operations. See Note 17 for a
    detailed discussion of these amounts.

Income per share of common stock.

The
    weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares
    used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share
    consisted of the following:

Weighted-average common and common equivalent shares used in the
    calculation of diluted earnings per share

279,815

298,284

291,747

The Company had a loss from continuing operations in 2008.
    Therefore, approximately 26 million shares underlying
    outstanding stock-based awards were excluded from the
    computation of diluted earnings per share because inclusion
    would be anti-dilutive. In 2007 and 2006, shares underlying
    outstanding stock-based awards excluded from the diluted share
    calculation were not material.

Currency translation.

The Company accounts for
    currency translation in accordance with Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards No. 52, “Foreign Currency
    Translation.” Balance sheet accounts are translated at the
    exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. Income
    statement accounts are translated at the average rate of
    exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments
    resulting from this process are charged or credited to other
    comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income.

Comprehensive income
    includes net income (loss) and all other non-stockholder changes
    in equity, or other comprehensive income. Elements of the
    Company’s other comprehensive income are reported in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of stockholders’
    equity, and the cumulative balance of these elements consisted
    of the following:

Reclassifications.

The consolidated financial
    statements for prior years reflect certain reclassifications,
    which have no effect on previously reported net income, to
    conform to the current year presentation. Substantially all of
    the prior year reclassifications relate to the classification of
    meals provided free to employees as a “General and
    administrative” expense, while in past periods the cost of
    these meals was charged to each operating department. The total
    amount reclassified to general and administrative expenses for
    the years ending 2007 and 2006 was $112 million and
    $98 million, respectively.

Fair value measurement.

The Company adopted
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”)
    for financial assets and liabilities on January 1, 2008.
    SFAS 157 establishes a framework for measuring the fair
    value of financial assets and liabilities and requires certain
    disclosures about fair value. The framework utilizes a fair
    value hierarchy consisting of the following:
    “Level 1” inputs, which are observable inputs for
    identical assets, such as quoted prices in an active market;
    “Level 2” inputs,



which are observable inputs for similar assets; and
    “Level 3” inputs, which are unobservable inputs.
    The Company’s only significant assets and liabilities
    affected by the adoption of SFAS 157 are:

1)

Marketable securities held in connection with the Company’s
    deferred compensation and supplemental executive retirement
    plans, and the plans’ corresponding liabilities. As of
    December 31, 2008, the assets and liabilities related to
    these plans each totaled $68 million, measured entirely
    using “Level 1” inputs.

2)

The Company’s investment in The M Resort LLC convertible
    note and embedded call option. The fair value of the convertible
    note was measured using “Level 2” inputs. The
    fair value of the embedded call option was measured using
    “Level 3” inputs, consisting primarily of
    estimates of future cash flows. See “Comprehensive
    income” in Note 3 for valuation adjustment recognized
    during 2008.

3)

The partial completion guarantee provided in connection with the
    CityCenter credit facility, discussed in Note 13, which
    fair value was measured using “Level 3” inputs,
    consisting of budgeted and historical construction costs.

Recently Issued Accounting Standards.

The
    following accounting standards were issued in 2007 and 2008 but
    will impact the Company in future periods.

Accounting for Business Combinations and Non-Controlling
    Interests

.  In December 2007, the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued
    SFAS No. 141(R), “Business Combinations,”
    (“SFAS 141R”) and SFAS No. 160
    “Non-controlling interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements — an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (“SFAS 160”). These standards amend the
    requirements for accounting for business combinations, including
    the recognition and measurement of additional assets and
    liabilities at their fair value, expensing of
    acquisition-related costs which are currently capitalizable
    under existing rules, treatment of adjustments to deferred taxes
    and liabilities subsequent to the measurement period, and the
    measurement of non-controlling interests, previously commonly
    referred to as minority interests, at fair value. SFAS 141R
    also includes additional disclosure requirements with respect to
    the methodologies and techniques used to determine the fair
    value of assets and liabilities recognized in a business
    combination. SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 apply
    prospectively to fiscal years beginning on or after
    December 15, 2008, except for the treatment of deferred tax
    adjustments which apply to deferred taxes recognized in previous
    business combinations. These standards became effective for the
    Company on January 1, 2009. The Company does not believe
    the adoption of SFAS 141R and SFAS 160 will have a
    material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests in Variable
    Interest Entities

.  In December 2008, the FASB
    issued FSP

FAS 140-4

and FIN 46(R)-8 “Disclosures by Public Entities
    (Enterprises) About Transfers of Financial Assets and Interests
    in Variable Interest Entities.” The FSP amends
    SFAS 140 and FIN 46(R) to enhance the disclosures
    required by the standards. The FSP enhances disclosures required
    by FIN 46(R) to include a discussion of significant
    judgments made in determining whether a variable interest entity
    (“VIE”) should be consolidated, as well as the nature
    of the risks and how an entity’s involvement with a VIE
    effects the financial position of the entity. The FSP is
    effective for the Company for the fiscal year ended
    December 31, 2008. The adoption of the FSP did not have a
    material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial
    statements.

Equity Method Investment Accounting
    Considerations

.  In November 2008, the Emerging
    Issues Task Force (“EITF”) of the FASB ratified its
    consensus on EITF

No. 08-6

“Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations”

(“EITF 08-6”).

The EITF reached a consensus on the following four issues
    addressed: a) the initial carrying value of an equity
    method investment is determined in accordance with
    SFAS 141(R); b) equity method investors should not
    separately test an investee’s underlying assets for
    impairment, but rather recognize other than temporary
    impairments of an equity method investment in accordance with
    APB Opinion 18; c) exceptions to recognizing gains from an
    investee’s issuance of shares in earnings in accordance
    with the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin 51 were
    removed to achieve consistency with SFAS 160; and
    d) the guidance in APB Opinion 18 to account for a change
    in the investor’s accounting from the equity method to the
    cost method should still be applied.

EITF 08-6

is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009. The
    Company does not believe the adoption of

EITF 08-6

will have a material impact on its consolidated financial
    statements.

The asset and liabilities of TI are classified as held for sale
    as of December 31, 2008. However, the results of its
    operations have not been classified as discontinued operations
    because the Company expects to continue to receive significant
    cash flows from customer migration.

CITYCENTER
    TRANSACTION

In August 2007, the Company and Dubai World agreed to form a


/


joint venture for the CityCenter development. The joint venture,
    CityCenter Holdings, LLC, is owned equally by the Company and
    Infinity World. In November 2007 the Company contributed the
    CityCenter assets which the parties valued at $5.4 billion,
    subject to certain adjustments. Infinity World contributed
    $2.96 billion in cash. At the close of the transaction, the
    Company received a cash distribution of $2.47 billion, of
    which $22 million was repaid in 2008 to CityCenter as a
    result of a post-closing adjustment. The Company will continue
    to serve as developer of CityCenter and, upon completion of
    construction, will manage CityCenter for a fee.

The initial contribution of the CityCenter assets was accounted
    for as a partial sale of real estate. As a partial sale, profit
    can be recognized when a seller retains an equity interest in
    the assets, but only to the extent of the outside equity
    interests, and only if the following criteria are met:
    1) the buyer is independent of the seller;



2) collection of the sales price is reasonably assured; and
    3) the seller will not be required to support the
    operations of the property to an extent greater than its
    proportionate retained interest.

The transaction met criteria 1 and 3, despite the Company’s
    equity interest and ongoing management of the project, because
    the Company does not control the venture and the management and
    other agreements between the Company and CityCenter have been
    assessed as being fair market value contracts. In addition, the
    Company assessed whether it had a prohibited form of continuing
    involvement based on the presence of certain contingent
    repurchase options, including an option to purchase Infinity
    World’s interest if Infinity World or Dubai World is denied
    required gaming approvals. The Company assessed the probability
    of such contingency as remote and, therefore, determined that a
    prohibited form of continuing involvement does not exist.

As described above, the Company did not receive the entire
    amount of the sales price, as a portion remained in the venture
    to fund near-term construction costs. Therefore, the Company
    believes that portion of the gain does not meet criteria 2 above
    and has been deferred. The Company recorded a gain of
    $1.03 billion based on the following (in millions):

Cash received:

The Company is accounting for its ongoing investment in
    CityCenter using the equity method, consistent with its other
    investments in unconsolidated affiliates. The Company assessed
    whether CityCenter should be consolidated under the provisions
    of FIN 46(R) and determined that CityCenter is not a
    variable interest entity, based on the following:
    1) CityCenter does not meet the scope exceptions in
    FIN 46(R); 2) the equity at risk in CityCenter is
    sufficient, based on qualitative assessments; 3) the equity
    holders of CityCenter (the Company and Infinity World) have the
    ability to control CityCenter and the right/obligation to
    receive/absorb expected returns/losses of CityCenter; and
    4) while the Company’s 50% voting rights in CityCenter
    may not be proportionate to its rights/obligations to
    receive/absorb expected returns/losses given the fact that the
    Company manages CityCenter, substantially all of the activities
    of CityCenter do not involve and are not conducted on behalf of
    the Company.

Through December 31, 2008, the Company and Infinity World
    had each made loans of $925 million to CityCenter, which
    are subordinate to the credit facility, to fund construction
    costs. During the fourth quarter of 2008, $425 million of
    each partner’s loan funding was converted to equity and
    each partner provided additional equity contributions of
    $228 million. Under the terms of the credit facility
    described below, the Company and Infinity World were each
    required to make additional equity commitments of up to
    $731 million as of December 31, 2008, which
    requirement would be reduced by future qualifying financing
    obtained by CityCenter. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the
    Company recorded a liability equal to the present value of the
    required future equity contributions, classified as “Other
    accrued liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheet, and a corresponding increase to its investment
    balance. Subsequent to December 31, 2008, each partner made
    additional contributions of $237 million each.

In October 2008, CityCenter closed on a $1.8 billion senior
    secured bank credit facility. The credit facility requires the
    Company and Infinity World to provide subordinated loans and
    equity contributions which will be used to fund construction
    costs prior to amounts being drawn under the credit facility. In
    conjunction with the CityCenter credit facility, the Company and
    Infinity World have entered into partial completion guarantees
    on a several basis — see Note 13.

During the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the
    Company incurred $46 million and $5 million,
    respectively, of costs reimbursable by CityCenter, which was
    comprised primarily of employee compensation, residential sales
    costs, and certain allocated costs. Such costs are recorded as
    “Other” operating expenses, and the reimbursement of
    such costs is recorded as “Other” revenue in the
    accompanying consolidated statements of operations.



During 2007, sales of units at The Signature at MGM Grand were
    completed and the joint venture essentially ceased sales
    operations. During the fourth quarter of 2007, the Company
    purchased the remaining 88 units in Towers B and C from the
    joint venture for $39 million. These units have been
    recorded as property, plant and equipment in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets.

The Company recognized the following related to its share of

The Company’s investment in unconsolidated affiliates does
    not equal the venture-level equity due to various basis
    differences. Basis differences related to depreciable assets are

    Resort Group acquisition was primarily assigned to Mandalay Bay,
    Luxor, Excalibur and Gold Strike Tunica. As a result of the
    Company’s annual impairment test of goodwill, the Company
    recognized a non-cash impairment charge of goodwill of
    $1.17 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 —
    included in “Property transactions, net” in the
    accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Such charge
    solely related to goodwill recognized in the Mandalay
    acquisition. Assumptions used in such analysis were impacted by
    current market conditions including: 1) lower market
    valuation multiples for gaming assets; 2) higher discount
    rates resulting from turmoil in the credit and equity markets;
    and 3) current cash flow forecasts for the affected
    resorts. The remaining balance of the Mandalay acquisition
    goodwill primarily relates to goodwill assigned to Gold Strike
    Tunica.

The Company’s indefinite-lived intangible assets balance of
    $334 million includes trademarks and trade names of
    $217 million related to the Mandalay acquisition. As a
    result of the Company’s annual impairment test of
    indefinite-lived intangible assets, the Company recognized a
    non-cash impairment charge of $12 million in the fourth
    quarter of 2008 — included in “Property
    transactions, net” in the accompanying consolidated
    statement of operations. Such charge solely related to trade
    names recognized in the Mandalay acquisition. The fair value of
    the trade names was determined using the relief-from-royalty
    method and was negatively impacted by the factors discussed
    above relating to the impairment of goodwill. The Company’s
    indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of
    development rights in Detroit and trademarks.

The Company’s remaining finite-lived intangible assets
    consist primarily of customer lists amortized over five years,
    lease acquisition costs amortized over the life of the related
    leases, and certain license rights amortized over their
    contractual life.

At December 31, 2007, amounts due within one year of the
    balance sheet date were classified as long-term in the
    accompanying consolidated balance sheets because the Company had
    both the intent and ability to repay these amounts with
    available borrowings under its senior credit facility. As
    discussed in Note 2, the senior credit facility was fully
    drawn during February 2009; therefore, the Company’s senior
    notes due in 2009 have been classified as current obligations as
    of December 31, 2008. We have not reclassified amounts
    outstanding on other long-term debt obligations —
    including the senior credit facility — as current. The
    Company does not believe that the inclusion of



an explanatory paragraph relating to its ability to continue as
    a going concern in the report of the Company’s independent
    registered public accounting firm constitutes an event of
    default under the senior credit facility, and does not believe
    the lenders could successfully assert such claim. However, in
    entering into the waiver and amendment described in Note 2,
    the lenders have indicated they are likely to assert such claim,
    though they have waived their right to assert such claim through
    May 15, 2009. To the extent the lenders were successful in
    such assertion, they could demand immediate repayment of all
    outstanding borrowings under the senior credit facility, and
    holders of our other long-term debt obligations could make
    similar demands under cross-default provisions.

The senior credit facility has a total capacity of
    $7 billion and matures in 2011. The Company has the ability
    to solicit additional lender commitments to increase the
    capacity to $8 billion. The components of the senior credit
    facility include a term loan facility of $2.5 billion and a
    revolving credit facility of $4.5 billion. The weighted
    average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under the senior
    credit facility at December 31, 2008 was 3.4%. At
    December 31, 2008, the Company had approximately
    $1.2 billion of available borrowing capacity under the
    senior credit facility. After giving effect to the events
    described in Note 2, the Company has borrowed the entire
    amount of available borrowings under the senior credit facility
    as of February 28, 2009.

In November 2008, the Company issued $750 million in
    aggregate principal amount of 13% senior secured notes due
    2013, at a discount to yield 15% with net proceeds to the
    Company of $687 million. The notes are secured by the
    equity interests and assets of New York-New York and otherwise
    rank equally with the Company’s existing and future senior
    indebtedness. The senior secured notes require that upon
    consummation of an asset sale, such as the proposed sale of TI,
    the Company either a) reinvest the net after-tax proceeds,
    which can include committed capital expenditures; or
    b) make an offer to repurchase a corresponding amount of
    senior secured notes at par plus accrued interest.

In November 2008, the Company redeemed $149.4 million of
    the aggregate outstanding principal amount of its
    7% debentures due 2036 pursuant to a one-time put option by
    the holders of such debentures. The Company recognized a
    $6 million gain on the redemption of these debentures,
    included within “Other, net” in the accompanying
    consolidated statement of operations.

In October 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors
    authorized the purchase of up to $500 million of the
    Company’s public debt securities. In 2008, the Company
    repurchased $345 million of principal amounts of its
    outstanding senior notes at a purchase price of
    $263 million in open market repurchases as follows:

•

$230 million in principal amount of our 6% senior
    notes due 2009;

•

$43 million in principal amount of our 8.5% senior
    notes due 2010;

•

$3.7 million in principal amount of the 6.375% senior
    notes due 2011;

•

$5.4 million in principal amount of our 6.75% senior
    notes due 2012;

•

$15.8 million in principal amount of our 6.75% senior
    notes due 2013;

•

$16.1 million in principal amount of our 5.875% senior
    notes due 2014;

•

$7.1 million in principal amount of our 6.875% senior
    notes due 2016;

•

$17.3 million in principal amount of our 7.5% senior
    notes due 2016; and

•

$7 million in principal amount of our 7.625% senior
    notes due 2017.



The Company recognized an $82 million gain on the
    repurchase of the above senior notes, included in “other,
    net” in the accompanying consolidated statement of
    operations.

In February 2008, the Company repaid the $180.4 million of
    6.75% senior notes at maturity using borrowings under the
    senior credit facility. In August 2008, the Company repaid the
    $196.2 million of 9.5% senior notes at maturity using
    borrowings under the senior credit facility.

In May 2007, the Company issued $750 million of
    7.5% senior notes due 2016. In June 2007, the Company
    repaid the $710 million of 9.75% senior subordinated
    notes at maturity. In August 2007, the Company repaid the
    $200 million of 6.75% senior notes and the
    $492.2 million of 10.25% senior subordinated notes at
    maturity using borrowings under the senior credit facility.

The Company and each of its material subsidiaries, excluding MGM
    Grand Detroit, LLC and the Company’s foreign subsidiaries,
    are directly liable for or unconditionally guarantee the senior
    credit facility, senior notes, senior debentures, and senior
    subordinated notes. MGM Grand Detroit, LLC is a guarantor under
    the senior credit facility, but only to the extent that MGM
    Grand Detroit, LLC borrows under such facilities. At
    December 31, 2008, the outstanding amount of borrowings
    related to MGM Grand Detroit, LLC was $404 million. See
    Note 19 for consolidating condensed financial information
    of the subsidiary guarantors and non-guarantors. Substantially
    all of the assets of New York-New York serve as collateral for
    the 13% senior secured notes issued in 2008; otherwise,
    none of our assets serve as collateral for our principal debt
    arrangements.

The Company’s long-term debt obligations contain customary
    covenants, including requiring the Company to maintain certain
    financial ratios. In September 2008, the Company amended its
    senior credit facility to increase the maximum total leverage
    ratio (debt to EBITDA, as defined) to 7.5:1.0 beginning with the
    fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2008, which will remain
    in effect through December 31, 2009, with step downs
    thereafter. The Company is also required to maintain a minimum
    coverage ratio (EBITDA to interest charges, as defined) of
    2.0:1.0. At December 31, 2008, the Company’s leverage
    and interest coverage ratios were 6.7:1.0 and 2.7:1.0,
    respectively. See Note 2 for further discussion of the
    financial covenants in our senior credit facility.

    The estimated fair value of the Company’s senior and senior
    subordinated notes was based on quoted market prices on or about

NOTE 12 —

INCOME
    TAXES

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes”
    (“SFAS 109”). SFAS 109 requires the
    recognition of deferred income tax assets, net of applicable
    reserves, related to net operating loss carryforwards and
    certain temporary differences. The standard requires recognition
    of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such
    benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation
    allowance is applied.

For federal income tax purposes, the Company has a foreign tax
    credit carryforward of $2 million that will expire in 2015
    if not utilized.

For state income tax purposes, the Company has New Jersey net
    operating loss carryforwards of $21 million, which equates
    to a deferred tax asset of $1 million, after federal tax
    effect, and before valuation allowance. The New Jersey net
    operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates from
    2009 through 2015 if not utilized.

At December 31, 2008, there is a $2 million valuation
    allowance, after federal effect, provided on certain New Jersey
    state net operating loss carryforwards and other New Jersey
    state deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance of
    $2 million on the foreign tax credit, and a $2 million
    valuation allowance related to certain foreign deferred tax
    assets because management believes these assets do not meet the
    “more likely than not” criteria for recognition under
    SFAS 109. Management believes all other deferred tax assets are
    more likely than not to be realized because of the future
    reversal of existing taxable temporary differences and expected
    future taxable income. Accordingly, there are no other valuation
    allowances provided at December 31, 2008.

Effective January 1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial
    Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes — an
    Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109”
    (“FIN 48”). FIN 48 requires that tax
    positions be assessed using a two-step process. A tax position
    is recognized if it meets a “more likely than not”
    threshold, and is measured at the largest amount of benefit that
    is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized.
    Uncertain tax positions must be reviewed at each balance sheet
    date. Liabilities recorded as a result of this analysis must
    generally be recorded separately from any current or deferred
    income tax accounts, and at December 31, 2008, the Company
    has classified $1 million as current (“Other accrued
    liabilities”) and $118 million as long-term
    (“Other long-term obligations”) in the accompanying
    consolidated balance sheets, based on the time until expected
    payment. A cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings was
    not required as a result of the implementation of FIN 48.

Gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31

$

102,783

$

The total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits that, if
    recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was
    $29 million and $24 million at December 31, 2008
    and December 31, 2007, respectively.

The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. This policy did
    not change as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. The
    Company had $17 million and $11 million in interest
    related to unrecognized tax benefits accrued as of
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively.
    No amounts were accrued for penalties as of either date. Income
    tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007 includes interest related to unrecognized
    tax benefits of $6 million and $7 million,
    respectively. For the year prior to adoption of FIN 48,
    income tax expense included amounts accrued for interest expense
    of $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal
    jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign
    jurisdictions, although the taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions
    are not material. As of December 31, 2008, the Company was
    no longer subject to examination of its U.S. federal income
    tax returns filed for years ended prior to 2003. While the IRS
    examination of the 2001 and 2002 tax years closed during the
    first quarter of 2007, the statute of limitations for assessing
    tax for such years has been extended in order for the Company to
    appeal issues related to a land sale transaction that were not
    agreed upon at the closure of the examination. The appeals
    discussions continue, and the Company has requested to enter
    into appeals mediation procedures with the IRS. Consequently,
    the Company believes that it is reasonably possible to settle
    these issues within the next twelve months. The IRS is currently
    examining the Company’s federal income tax returns for the
    2003 and 2004 tax years and a subsidiary of the Company for the
    2004 through 2006 tax years. Tax returns for subsequent years of
    the Company are also subject to examination. In addition, during
    the first quarter of 2009, the IRS initiated an examination of
    the federal income tax return of Mandalay Resort Group for the
    pre-acquisition year ended April 25, 2005. The statute of
    limitations for assessing tax for the Mandalay Resort Group
    federal income tax return for the year ended January 31,
    2005 has been extended but such return is not currently under
    examination by the IRS.

As of December 31, 2008, the Company was no longer subject
    to examination of its various state and local tax returns filed
    for years ended prior to 2003. A Mandalay Resort Group
    subsidiary return for the pre-acquisition year ended
    April 25, 2005 is under examination by the City of Detroit.
    During the first quarter of 2008, the state of Mississippi
    settled an examination of returns filed by subsidiaries of MGM
    MIRAGE and Mandalay Resort Group for the 2004 through 2006 tax
    years. This settlement resulted in a payment of additional taxes
    and interest of less than $1 million. No other state or
    local income tax returns of the Company are currently under exam.

The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the
    total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31,
    2008 may decrease by a range of $0 to $2 million
    within the next twelve months, primarily on the expectation that
    the appeal of the 2001 and 2002 tax year issues may close during
    such period. As of December 31, 2007, the Company believed
    that it was reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized
    tax benefits at such date may decrease by a range of $0 to
    $8 million during the year ended December 31, 2008,
    primarily on the expectation that the appeal of the 2001 and
    2002 tax year issues would close and various statutes of
    limitation would lapse during 2008. However, the appeal did not
    close during 2008 and the Company increased the amount of
    certain other unrecognized tax benefits during 2008 based upon a
    reassessment of the measurement of such tax benefits during the
    year.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Leases.

The Company leases real estate and
    various equipment under operating and, to a lesser extent,
    capital lease arrangements. Certain real estate leases provide
    for escalation of rent based upon a specified price index

and/or

based
    upon periodic appraisals.

At December 31, 2008, the Company was obligated under
    non-cancelable operating leases and capital leases to make
    future minimum lease payments as follows:

    accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Rental expense for
    operating leases, including rental expense of discontinued
    operations, was $29 million for December 31, 2008 and
    $36 million for each of the years ended December 31,
    2007 and 2006.

Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation.

The Company
    entered into a series of agreements to implement a strategic
    alliance with the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation
    (“MPTN”), which owns and operates Foxwoods Casino
    Resort in Mashantucket, Connecticut. The Company and MPTN have
    formed a jointly owned company — Unity Gaming,
    LLC — to acquire or develop future gaming and
    non-gaming enterprises. Under certain circumstances, the Company
    will provide a loan of up to $200 million to finance a
    portion of MPTN’s investment in joint projects.

Kerzner/Istithmar Joint Venture.

In September
    2007, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with
    Kerzner International and Istithmar forming a joint venture to
    develop a multi-billion dollar integrated resort to be located
    on the southwest corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Sahara
    Avenue. In September 2008, the Company and its partners agreed
    to defer additional design and pre-construction activities and
    amended their joint venture agreement accordingly. In the event
    the joint venture determines that the resort will be developed,
    the Company will contribute 40 acres of land, valued at
    $20 million per acre, for fifty percent of the equity in
    the joint venture. Kerzner International and Istithmar will
    contribute cash totaling $600 million, of which
    $200 million will be distributed to the Company, for the
    other 50% of the equity.

CityCenter completion guarantee.

As discussed
    in Note 8, the Company and Infinity World have entered into
    partial completion guarantees in conjunction with the CityCenter
    credit facility. The partial completion guarantees provide for
    additional contingent funding of construction costs in the event
    such funding is necessary to complete the project, up to a
    maximum amount of $600 million from each partner. During
    the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded a liability of
    $205 million, classified as “Other long-term
    obligations” in the accompanying consolidated balance
    sheets, equal to the fair value of its partial completion
    guarantee in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45,
    “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements
    for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
    Others.”



Other guarantees.

The Company is party to
    various guarantee contracts in the normal course of business,
    which are generally supported by letters of credit issued by
    financial institutions. The Company’s senior credit
    facility limits the amount of letters of credit that can be
    issued to $250 million, and the amount of available
    borrowings under the senior credit facility is reduced by any
    outstanding letters of credit. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had provided $92 million of total letters of
    credit, including $50 million to support bonds issued by
    the Economic Development Corporation of the City of Detroit,
    which are recorded as a liability of the Company. Though not
    subject to a letter of credit, the Company has an agreement with
    the Nevada Gaming Control Board to maintain $120 million of
    availability under its senior credit facility to support normal
    bankroll requirements at the Company’s Nevada operations.
    Due to the fact that the Company borrowed the remaining
    available funds under its senior credit facility after
    December 31, 2008 as described in Note 2, the Company
    has established separate bank accounts to hold a minimum of
    $120 million to support its obligation under the bankroll
    requirements.

Sales and use tax on complimentary meals.

In
    March 2008, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled, in a case involving
    another casino company, that food and non-alcoholic beverages
    purchased for use in providing complimentary meals to customers
    and to employees were exempt from sales and use tax. The Company
    had previously paid use tax on these items and has generally
    filed for refunds for the periods from January 2001 to February
    2008 related to this matter. The amount subject to these
    refunds, including amounts related to the Mandalay Resort Group
    properties prior to the Company’s 2005 acquisition of
    Mandalay Resort Group, is approximately $38 million.

The Nevada Department of Taxation (the “Department”)
    filed a petition for rehearing, which the Nevada Supreme Court
    announced in July 2008 it would not grant. As of
    December 31, 2008, the Company had not recorded income
    related to this matter because the refund claims are subject to
    audit and it is unclear whether the Department will pursue
    alternative legal theories in connection with certain issues
    raised in the Supreme Court case in any audit of the refund
    claims. However, the Company is claiming the exemption on sales
    and use tax returns for periods after February 2008 in light of
    the Nevada Supreme Court decision.

Litigation.

The Company is a party to various
    legal proceedings, most of which relate to routine matters
    incidental to its business. Management does not believe that the
    outcome of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect
    on the Company’s financial position or results of
    operations.

NOTE 14 —

STOCKHOLDERS’
    EQUITY

Tender offer.

In February 2008, the Company
    and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Dubai World completed a joint
    tender offer to purchase 15 million shares of Company
    common stock at a price of $80 per share. The Company purchased
    8.5 million shares at a total purchase price of
    $680 million.

Stock sale.

On October 18, 2007, the
    Company completed the sale of 14.2 million shares of common
    stock to Infinity World Investments, a wholly-owned subsidiary
    of Dubai World, at a price of $84 per share for total proceeds
    of approximately $1.2 billion. These shares were previously
    held by the Company as treasury stock. Proceeds from the sale
    were used to reduce amounts outstanding under the senior credit
    facility.

Stock repurchases.

Share repurchases are only
    conducted under repurchase programs approved by the Board of
    Directors and publicly announced. At December 31, 2008, the
    Company had 20 million shares available for repurchase
    under the May 2008 authorization. Share repurchase activity was

STOCK-BASED
    COMPENSATION

Information about the Company’s share-based
    awards.

The Company adopted an omnibus incentive
    plan in 2005 which, as amended, allows it to grant stock
    options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”),
    restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and
    other stock-based awards to eligible directors, officers and
    employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The plans are
    administered by the Compensation Committee (the
    “Committee”) of the Board of Directors. The Committee
    has discretion under the omnibus plan regarding which type of
    awards to grant, the vesting and service requirements, exercise
    price and other conditions, in all cases subject to certain
    limits, including:

•

As amended, the omnibus plan allows for the issuance of up to
    35 million (20 million prior to an August 2008
    amendment) shares or share-based awards;

•

For stock options and SARs, the exercise price of the award must
    be at least equal to the fair market value of the stock on the
    date of grant and the maximum term of such an award is
    10 years.

Stock options and SARs granted under all plans generally have
    terms of either seven or ten years, and in most cases vest in
    either four or five equal annual installments. RSUs granted vest
    ratably over 4 years. The Company’s practice is to
    issue new shares upon exercise or vesting of awards.

Exchange offer.

In September 2008, the Company
    offered certain eligible employees an opportunity to exchange
    certain outstanding stock options and SARs for RSUs which
    provide a right to receive one share of common stock for each
    RSU. The exchange offer expired in October 2008. The number of
    RSUs to be granted in the exchange offer was based on an
    exchange ratio for each grant determined by the Committee. The
    total number of stock options and SARs eligible to be exchanged
    was approximately 4.7 million, of which approximately
    4.2 million were exchanged for a total of approximately
    0.7 million RSUs. On the date of the exchange, the
    estimated fair value of the RSUs did not exceed the estimated
    fair value of the exchanged stock options and SARs calculated
    immediately prior to the exchange. Therefore, the Company will
    not record additional expense related to the exchange and the
    unamortized compensation related to the exchanged stock options
    and SARs will continue to be amortized to expense ratably over
    the remaining life of the new RSUs. The RSUs granted in the
    exchange offer will vest on the same dates that the underlying
    stock options and SARs would have otherwise vested, except that
    no RSUs will vest prior to July 1, 2009. All exchanged
    stock options and SARs which have vested, or would have vested,
    before July 1, 2009 were replaced by RSUs that vest on
    July 1, 2009.

Activity under share-based payment plans.

As
    of December 31, 2008, the aggregate number of share-based
    awards available for grant under the omnibus plan was
    17.6 million. A summary of activity under the
    Company’s share-based payment plans for the twelve months

As of December 31, 2008, there was a total of
    $73 million of unamortized compensation related to
    restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized over
    a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. $67 million of
    such unamortized compensation relates to the RSUs granted in the
    exchange. RSUs granted to corporate officers are subject to
    certain performance requirements determined by the Committee.
    Such performance requirements do not apply to RSUs granted in
    the exchange offer.

Recognition of compensation cost.

The Company
    adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
    (revised 2004), “Share-Based Payment”
    (“SFAS 123(R)”) on January 1, 2006 using the
    modified prospective method. The Company recognizes the
    estimated fair value of stock options and SARs granted under the
    Company’s omnibus plan based on the estimated fair value of
    these awards measured at the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes model. For restricted stock units, compensation
    cost is calculated based on the fair market value of our stock
    on the date of grant. For stock options awards granted prior to
    adoption, the unamortized expense is being recognized on an
    accelerated basis, since this was the method used for disclosure
    purposes prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). For all
    awards granted after adoption, such expense is being recognized
    on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards.
    Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant, with such
    estimate updated periodically and with actual forfeitures
    recognized currently to the extent they differ from the
    estimate. The Company capitalizes stock-based compensation
    related to employees dedicated to construction activities. In
    addition, the Company charges CityCenter for stock-based
    compensation related to employees dedicated to CityCenter.

Expected volatility is based in part on historical volatility
    and in part on implied volatility based on traded options on the
    Company’s stock. The expected term considers the
    contractual term of the option as well as historical exercise
    and forfeiture behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on
    the rates in effect on the grant date for U.S. Treasury
    instruments with maturities matching the relevant expected term
    of the award.

NOTE 16 —

EMPLOYEE
    BENEFIT PLANS

Employees of the Company who are members of various unions are
    covered by union-sponsored, collectively bargained,
    multi-employer health and welfare and defined benefit pension
    plans. The Company recorded an expense of $192 million in
    2008, $194 million in 2007 and $189 million in 2006
    under such plans. The plans’ sponsors have not provided
    sufficient information to permit the Company to determine its
    share of unfunded vested benefits, if any.

The Company is self-insured for most health care benefits for
    its non-union employees. The liability for claims filed and
    estimates of claims incurred but not reported —
    $22 million and $25 million at December 31, 2008
    and 2007, respectively — is included in “Other
    accrued liabilities” in the accompanying consolidated
    balance sheets.

The Company has retirement savings plans under
    Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code for eligible
    employees. The plans allow employees to defer, within prescribed
    limits, up to 30% of their income on a pre-tax basis through
    contributions to the plans. The Company matches, within
    prescribed limits, a portion of eligible employees’
    contributions. In the case of certain union employees, the
    Company contributions to the plan are based on hours worked. The
    Company recorded charges for 401(k) contributions of
    $25 million in 2008 and $27 million in 2007 and 2006.

The Company maintains nonqualified deferred retirement plans for
    certain key employees. The plans allow participants to defer, on
    a pre-tax basis, a portion of their salary and bonus and
    accumulate tax deferred earnings, plus investment earnings on
    the deferred balances, as a deferred tax savings. Through
    December 31, 2008 participants earned a Company match of up
    to 4% of salary, net of any Company match received under the
    Company’s 401(k) plan. All employee deferrals vest
    immediately. The Company matching contributions vest



ratably over a three-year period. The Company recorded charges
    for matching contributions of $1 million in 2008 and 2007,
    and $2 million in 2006.

The Company also maintains nonqualified supplemental executive
    retirement plans (“SERP”) for certain key employees.
    Until September 30, 2008, the Company made quarterly
    contributions intended to provide a retirement benefit that is a
    fixed percentage of a participant’s estimated final
    five-year average annual salary, up to a maximum of 65%. Company
    contributions and investment earnings on the contributions are
    tax-deferred and accumulate as deferred tax savings. Employees
    do not make contributions under these plans. A portion of the
    Company contributions and investment earnings thereon vest after
    three years of SERP participation and the remaining portion
    vests after both five years of SERP participation and
    10 years of continuous service. The Company recorded
    expense under this plan of $4 million in 2008 and
    $7 million in 2007 and 2006.

Pursuant to the amendments of the nonqualified deferred
    retirement plans and SERP plans during 2008, and consistent with
    certain transitional relief provided by the Internal Revenue
    Service pursuant to rules governing nonqualified deferred
    compensation, the Company permitted participants under the plans
    to make a one-time election to receive, without penalty, all or
    a portion of their respective vested account balances. Based on
    elections made, the Company made payments to participants of
    $62 million subsequent to December 31, 2008. In
    addition, the Company made payments of $57 million to
    participants in 2008 related to previous versions of these plans
    that were terminated during the year.

RELATED
    PARTY TRANSACTIONS

The Company and CityCenter have entered into agreements whereby
    the Company will be responsible for oversight and management of
    the design, planning, development and construction of CityCenter
    and will manage the operations of CityCenter for a fee upon
    completion of construction. The Company is being reimbursed for
    certain costs in performing the development services. During the
    years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    incurred $46 million and $5 million, respectively of
    costs reimbursable by the joint venture, primarily for employee
    compensation and certain allocated costs. As of
    December 31, 2008, CityCenter owes the Company
    $5 million for unreimbursed development services costs.

Borgata leases 10 acres from the Company on a long-term
    basis for use in its current operations and for its expansion,
    and nine acres from the Company on a short-term basis for
    surface parking. Total payments received from Borgata under
    these lease agreements were $6 million in each of the years
    ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006.

The Company paid legal fees to a firm that was affiliated with
    the Company’s general counsel. Payments to the firm totaled
    $10 million, $11 million, and $8 million for the
    years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
    respectively. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the Company
    owed the firm $4 million and $3 million, respectively.

The Company has occasionally chartered aircraft from its
    majority shareholder, Tracinda, and pays Tracinda at market
    rates. No payments were made to Tracinda in 2008 or 2007.
    Payments to Tracinda for the use of its aircraft totaled
    $2 million for the year ended December 31, 2006.

Members of the Company’s Board of Directors, senior
    management, and Tracinda signed contracts in 2006 and 2007 for
    the purchase of condominium units at CityCenter, at prices
    consistent with prices charged to unrelated third parties, when
    CityCenter was a wholly-owned development. The Company collected
    $6 million of deposits related to such purchases in 2007;
    amounts collected in 2006 were not material.

Because income per share amounts are calculated using the
    weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent
    shares outstanding during each quarter, the sum of the per share
    amounts for the four quarters may not equal the total income per
    share amounts for the year.

As discussed in Note 9, the Company recorded a
    $1.18 billion impairment charge related to goodwill and
    indefinite-lived intangible assets recognized in the Mandalay
    acquisition in 2005. The impairment was recorded in the fourth
    quarter of 2008, and resulted in a $4.25 impact on fourth
    quarter 2008 diluted loss per share and a $4.20 impact on full
    year 2008 diluted loss per share.

As discussed in Note 5, the Company recorded a
    $1.03 billion pre-tax gain on the contribution of the
    CityCenter assets to a joint venture. The gain was recorded in
    the fourth quarter of 2007, and resulted in a $2.23 impact on
    fourth quarter 2007 diluted earnings per share and a $2.28
    impact on full year 2007 diluted earnings per share.

As discussed in Note 1, Beau Rivage closed in August 2005
    due to damage sustained from Hurricane Katrina and re-opened one
    year later. During 2007, we recorded pre-tax income from
    insurance recoveries of $284 million with an annual impact
    on diluted earnings per share of $0.62. We recorded
    $135 million in the third quarter of 2007 and
    $149 million in the fourth quarter of 2007, with
    corresponding impacts on diluted earnings per share of $0.30 and
    $0.32, respectively.
