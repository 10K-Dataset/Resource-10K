PART I

ITEM 1. Business.

HP is a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and
medium-sized businesses ("SMBs") and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. Our offerings span:

•

multi-vendor customer services, including infrastructure technology and business process outsourcing, technology support
and maintenance, application development and support services and consulting and integration services;

•

enterprise information technology infrastructure, including enterprise storage and server technology, networking products
and solutions, information management software and software that optimizes business technology investments;

•

personal computing and other access devices; and

•

imaging and printing-related products and services.

HP
was incorporated in 1947 under the laws of the State of California as the successor to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard. Effective in
May 1998, we changed our state of incorporation from California to Delaware.



HP Products and Services; Segment Information

Our operations are organized into seven business segments: Services, Enterprise Storage and Servers ("ESS"), HP Software, the Personal
Systems Group ("PSG"), the Imaging and Printing Group ("IPG"), HP Financial Services ("HPFS"), and Corporate Investments. Services, ESS and HP Software are reported collectively as a broader HP
Enterprise Business. While the HP Enterprise Business is not an operating segment, we sometimes provide financial data aggregating the segments within it in order to provide a supplementary view of
our business. In each of the past three fiscal years, notebooks, desktops and printing supplies each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue. In fiscal 2009 and 2010,
infrastructure technology outsourcing also accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue.

A
summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our segments and business units is found in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. A discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

HP Enterprise Business

The HP Enterprise Business provides servers, storage, software and information technology ("IT") services that enable enterprise and
midmarket business customers to better manage their current IT environments and transform IT into a business enabler. HP Enterprise
Business products, software and services help accelerate growth, minimize risk and reduce costs to optimize the business value of customers' IT investments. Companies around the globe leverage HP's
infrastructure solutions to deploy next generation data centers and address business challenges ranging from compliance to business continuity. The HP Enterprise Business's modular IT systems and
services are primarily standards-based and feature differentiated technologies in areas including power and cooling, unified management, security, virtualization and automation. Each of the three
financial reporting segments within the HP Enterprise Business are described in detail below.

Services

Services provides consulting, outsourcing and technology services across infrastructure, applications and business process domains.
Services delivers to its clients by leveraging investments in consulting and support professionals, infrastructure technology, applications, standardized methodologies, and global supply and delivery.
Our services businesses also create opportunities for us to sell additional hardware units by offering solutions that encompass both products and services. Services is divided into four main business
units: infrastructure technology outsourcing, technology services, applications services and business process outsourcing.

Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing.

Infrastructure technology outsourcing delivers comprehensive services that streamline and
optimize our
clients' infrastructure to efficiently enhance performance, reduce costs, mitigate risk and enable business change. These services encompass the data center and the workplace (desktop); network and
communications; and security, compliance and business continuity. We also offer a set of managed services, providing a cross-section of our broader infrastructure services for smaller discrete
engagements.

Technology Services.

HP provides consulting and support services, as well as warranty support across HP's product lines. HP specializes
in keeping
technology running with mission critical services, converged infrastructure services, networking services, data center transformation services and infrastructure services for storage, server and
unified communication environments. HP's technology services offerings are available in the form of service contracts, pre-packaged offerings (HP Care Pack services) or on an individual
basis.



Application Services.

Applications services help clients revitalize and manage their applications assets through flexible,
project-based, consulting
services and longer-term outsourcing contracts. These full life cycle services encompass application development, testing, modernization, system integration, maintenance and management.
Applications projects open doors to new infrastructure technology outsourcing and business process outsourcing opportunities and represent attractive cross-selling opportunities to current HP clients.

Business Process Outsourcing.

Business process outsourcing is powered by a platform of underlying infrastructure technology,
applications and
standardized methodologies and is supplemented by IT experience and in-depth, industry-specific knowledge. These services encompass both industry-specific and cross-industry solutions. Our
cross-industry solutions include a broad array of enterprise shared services, customer relationship management services, financial process management services and administrative services.

Enterprise Storage and Servers

The server market continues to shift towards standards-based architectures as proprietary hardware and operating systems are replaced
by industry standard server platforms that typically offer compelling price and performance advantages by leveraging standards-based operating systems and microprocessor designs. At the same time,
critical business functions continue to demand scalability and reliability. By providing a broad portfolio of storage and server solutions, ESS aims to optimize the combined product solutions required
by different customers and provide solutions for a wide range of operating environments, spanning both the enterprise and the SMB markets. ESS provides storage and server products in a number of
categories.

Industry Standard Servers.

Industry standard servers include primarily entry-level and mid-range ProLiant servers, which run primarily
Windows®, Linux and Novell operating systems and leverage Intel Corporation ("Intel") and Advanced Micro Devices ("AMD") processors. The business spans a range of product lines that
include pedestal-tower servers, density-optimized rack servers and HP's BladeSystem family of server blades. In fiscal 2010, HP's industry standard server business continued to lead the industry in
terms of units shipped and revenue. HP also has a leadership position in server blades, the fastest growing segment of the market.

Business Critical Systems.

Business Critical Systems include HP Integrity servers based on the Intel® Itanium®-based
processor that run HP-UX, Windows and OpenVMS operating systems, as well as fault-tolerant HP Integrity NonStop solutions. Business Critical Systems also include HP's scale-up
x86 ProLiant servers with more than four processors. In addition, HP continues to support the HP9000 servers and HP AlphaServers with compelling offers available to upgrade these legacy systems to
current HP Integrity systems. During 2010, we introduced new Integrity blade servers and the Superdome 2 server solution based on the BladeSystem architecture.

Storage.

HP's StorageWorks offerings include entry-level, mid-range and high-end arrays, storage area networks, network
attached storage, storage management software and virtualization technologies, as well as StoreOnce data deduplication solutions, tape drives, tape libraries and optical archival storage.

HP Software

HP Software is a leading provider of enterprise and service-provider software and services. Our portfolio consists of:

Enterprise IT management software.

Enterprise IT management solutions, including support and professional services, allow customers to
manage IT
infrastructure, operations, applications, IT services, and business processes. These solutions also include tools to automate data center operations and IT



processes.
We market them as the HP business technology optimization suite, and we deliver them in the form of traditional software licenses and, in some cases, via a
software-as-a-service distribution model.

Information management and business intelligence solutions.

Our information management and business intelligence solutions include
information data
strategy, enterprise data warehousing, data integration, data protection, archiving, compliance, e-discovery and records management products. These solutions enable businesses to extract
more value from their structured and unstructured information.

Communications and media solutions.

Our communications and media industry solutions address the creation, delivery and management of
consumer and
enterprise communications services, with offerings in service delivery infrastructure and applications, real-time business support systems, next-generation operations support
systems and digital media. These solutions enable operators, media companies, and network equipment providers to drive incremental revenue, enable new business models and reduce infrastructure costs.

Personal Systems Group

PSG is the leading provider of personal computers ("PCs") in the world based on unit volume shipped and annual revenue. PSG provides
commercial PCs, consumer PCs, workstations, handheld computing devices, calculators and other related accessories, software and services for the commercial and consumer markets. We group commercial
desktops, commercial notebooks and workstations into commercial clients and consumer desktop and consumer notebooks into consumer clients when describing our performance in these markets. Like the
broader PC market, PSG continues to experience a shift toward mobile products such as notebooks. Both commercial and consumer PCs are based predominately on the Windows operating system and use Intel
and AMD processors.

Commercial PCs.

Commercial PCs are optimized for commercial uses, including enterprise and small-and medium- sized business ("SMB")
customers, and
for connectivity and manageability in networked environments. Commercial PCs include HP Compaq, HP Pro and HP Elite lines of business desktops and notebooks, as well as the All in One TouchSmart and
Omni PCs, HP Mini-Note PCs, HP Blade PCs, Retail POS systems and HP TwinClients.

Consumer PCs.

Consumer PCs include the HP and Compaq series of multi-media consumer desktops, notebooks and mini notebooks, including
the TouchSmart

Workstations are individual computing products designed for users demanding enhanced performance, such as computer
animation,
engineering design and other programs requiring
high-resolution graphics. PSG provides workstations that run on both Windows® and Linux-based operating systems.

Handheld Computing.

PSG provides a series of HP iPAQ Pocket PC handheld computing devices that run on Windows Mobile® software.
These
products range from basic PDAs to advanced "smartphone" devices with voice and data capability.

Imaging and Printing Group

IPG provides consumer and commercial printer hardware, printing supplies, printing media and scanning devices. IPG is also focused on
imaging solutions in the commercial markets. These solutions range from managed print services solutions to addressing new growth opportunities in commercial printing and capturing
high-value pages in areas such as industrial applications, outdoor signage, and the graphic arts business.



Inkjet and Web Solutions.

Inkjet and web solutions include HP's consumer and SMB inkjet solutions (hardware, supplies, and media) and HP's
retail and web businesses. These solutions include single function and all-in-one inkjet printers targeted toward consumers and SMBs as well as retail publishing solutions,
Snapfish, and Logoworks.

LaserJet and Enterprise Solutions.

LaserJet and enterprise solutions include LaserJet printers and supplies, multi-function printers
("MFDs"), scanners, and enterprise software solutions such as Exstream Software and Web Jetadmin.

Indigo printing, specialty printing systems and inkjet high-speed production solutions.

Printer Supplies.

Printer supplies include LaserJet toner and inkjet printer cartridges, graphic solutions ink products and other
printing-related media.

HP Financial Services

HPFS supports and enhances HP's global product and service solutions, providing a broad range of value-added financial life cycle
management services. HPFS enables our worldwide customers to acquire complete IT solutions, including hardware, software and services. The group offers leasing, financing, utility programs and asset
recovery services, as well as financial asset management services for large global and enterprise customers. HPFS also provides an array of specialized financial services to SMBs and educational and
governmental entities. HPFS offers innovative, customized and flexible alternatives to balance unique customer cash flow, technology obsolescence and capacity needs.

Corporate Investments

Corporate Investments includes Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, also known as HP Labs, network infrastructure products, mobile devices
associated with the Palm acquisition, and certain business incubation projects. Revenue in this segment is attributable to the sale of certain network infrastructure products, including Ethernet
switch products that enhance computing and enterprise solutions under the ProCurve, 3Com and TippingPoint brands. The segment also includes certain video collaboration products sold under the brand
"Halo," and Palm smartphones, which are targeted at the consumer segment and include the Pixi and Pre models running on the WebOS operating system. Corporate Investments also derives revenue from
licensing specific HP technology to third parties.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We manage our business and report our financial results based on the principal business segments described above. Our customers are
organized by consumer and
commercial customer groups, and distribution is organized by direct and channel. Within the channel, we have various types of partners that we utilize for various customer groups. The partners
include:

•

retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or Internet stores;

•

resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted
customer groups;

•

distribution partners that supply our solutions to smaller resellers with which we do not have direct relationships;



•

independent distributors that sell our products into geographies or customer segments in which we have little or no
presence;

•

original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") that integrate our products with their own hardware or software and sell the
integrated products;

•

independent software vendors ("ISVs") that provide their clients with specialized software products, and often assist us
in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products;

•

systems integrators that provide various levels and kinds of expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions
and often partner with our services business to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and

•

advisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems integration work, and
that typically partner with our services business on client solutions that require our unique products and services.

The
mix of HP's business by channel or direct sales differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions
necessitate sales, marketing and distribution to be tailored accordingly. HP is focused on driving the depth and breadth of its coverage in addition to efficiencies and productivity gains in both the
direct and indirect business.

The
HP Enterprise Business manages most of our enterprise and public sector customer relationships and also has primary responsibility for simplifying sales processes across our segments
to improve speed and effectiveness of customer delivery. In this capacity, the HP Enterprise Business manages our direct sales for value products including UNIX®, enterprise storage and
software and pre-sales technical consultants, as well as our direct distribution activities for commercial products and go-to-market activities with systems
integrators and ISVs. The HP Enterprise Business also drives HP horizontal and vertical solutions through our own services arm and through the partners previously listed above. The HP Enterprise
Business drives HP's vertical sales and marketing approach in the communication, media and entertainment, financial services, manufacturing and distribution and public sector industries.

PSG
manages SMB customer relationships and commercial reseller channels, due largely to the significant volume of commercial PCs that HP sells through these channels. In addition to
commercial channel relationships, the Volume Direct organization, which is charged with the management of direct sales for volume products, is hosted within PSG. In addition, PSG manages direct online
sales through the Consumer Exchange and the Small Business Exchange.

IPG
manages HP's overall consumer-related sales and marketing activities, including our annual consumer product launch for the back-to-school and holiday seasons.
IPG also manages consumer channel relationships with third-party retail locations for imaging and printing products, as well as other consumer products, including consumer PCs, which provides for a
bundled sale opportunity between PCs and IPG products.

Manufacturing and Materials

We utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers ("OMs") around the world to manufacture HP-designed products.
The use of OMs is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for HP-designed products. We use multiple OMs to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and
manufacturing processes. In some circumstances, third-party OEMs manufacture products that we purchase and resell under the HP brand. In addition to our use of OMs, we currently manufacture a limited
number of finished products from components and sub-assemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.



We
utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We employ building products to order capabilities to
maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Configuring products to order permits configuration of units to the particular hardware and
software customization requirements of customers. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory
holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers.

We
purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such sources
are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines, LaserJet supplies and parts for products with short life cycles (although some of these sources have operations in
multiple locations in the event of a disruption). We are dependent upon Intel as a supplier of processors and Microsoft for various software products. However, we believe that disruptions with these
suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. For processors, we also have a relationship
with AMD, and we have continued to see solid acceptance of AMD processors in the market during fiscal 2010.

Like
other participants in the high technology industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our
requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we experience significant price volatility and supply constraints for certain components that are not available from
multiple sources. Frequently, we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an impact on gross margin but does not disrupt production. We also
acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. See
"Risk Factors—We
depend on third-party suppliers, and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

International

Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis
for both consumer and enterprise customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides
revenue streams to offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. In addition, we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our
ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries. In this regard, we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base upon which to build such future
growth.

A
summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property, plant and equipment is set forth in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8,
which is incorporated herein by reference. Approximately 65% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2010 came from outside the United States. The substantial majority of our net revenue originating
outside the United States was from customers other than foreign governments.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to HP's foreign operations, see "Risk Factors—Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other
factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition," in Item 1A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk" in Item 7A and Note 10
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.



Research and Development

We remain committed to innovation as a key element of HP's culture. Our development efforts are focused on designing and developing
products, services and solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also
are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and
maximize our customers' experiences.

HP
Labs, together with the various research and development groups within the five principal business segments, are responsible for our research and development efforts. HP Labs is part
of our Corporate Investments segment.

Expenditures
for research and development were $3.0 billion in fiscal 2010, $2.8 billion in fiscal 2009 and $3.5 billion in fiscal 2008. We anticipate that we will
continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services to maintain and enhance our
competitive position.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see "Risk Factors—If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and
services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Patents

Our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products
and services or where proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At October 31, 2010, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 37,000 patents, which represents an increase
over the number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of both fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008.

Patents
generally have a term of twenty years from the time they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms on the individual patents vary. We
believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our ability to access technology of third parties, and
maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to us as a whole or any of our principal business segments.

In
addition to developing our patents, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses under
patents owned by us when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors—Our revenue, cost of sales, and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or
enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein
by reference.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the diversity of our products and services
portfolio, including the large volume of products delivered from shelf or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not
material to an understanding of our overall business.



Seasonality

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our
products experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales often are weaker
in the summer months and consumer sales often are stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of
seasonal trends. See "Risk Factors—Our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable," in Item 1A, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

We encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity. We compete primarily on the basis of technology,
performance, price, quality, reliability, brand,
reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security and availability of application software
and our Internet infrastructure offerings.

The
markets for each of our business segments are characterized by vigorous competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and
rapidly growing firms. Product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete
effectively on the basis of the factors listed above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and often market their products
under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will continue to be critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to
continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.

On
a revenue basis we are the largest company offering our range of general purpose computers and personal information, imaging and printing products for industrial, scientific, business
and consumer applications, and IT services. We are the leader or among the leaders in each of our principal business segments.

The
competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below:

Enterprise Storage and Servers.

The areas in which ESS operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid and ongoing
technological
innovation and price reductions. Our competitors range from broad solution providers such as International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") to more focused competitors such as EMC Corporation and
NetApp, Inc. in storage and Dell, Inc. in industry standard servers. We believe that our important competitive advantages in this segment include the six technology components of our
converged infrastructure initiatives: IT systems, power and cooling, security, management, virtualization and automation. We believe that our competitive advantages also include our global reach and
our significant intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities, which will contribute to further enhancements of our product and service offerings and our ability to
cross-sell our portfolio and leverage scale advantages in everything from brand to procurement leverage.



Services.

Our service businesses including HP Enterprise Services and Technology Services compete in IT support services, consulting and
integration,
infrastructure technology outsourcing, business process outsourcing and application services. The IT support services and consulting and integration markets have been under significant pressure as our
customers have reduced their IT budgets. However, this trend has benefited the outsourcing services business as customers drive toward lower IT management costs to enable more strategic investments.
Our competitors include IBM Global Services, Computer Sciences Corporation, systems integration firms such as Accenture Ltd. and offshore companies such as Fujitsu Limited and India-based
competitors Wipro Limited. Infosys Technologies Limited and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. We also compete with other traditional hardware providers, such as Dell, which are
increasingly offering services to support their products. Many of our competitors are able to offer a wide range of global services, and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition.
Our service businesses team with many companies to offer services, and those arrangements allow us to extend our reach and augment our capabilities. Our competitive advantages are evident in our deep
technology expertise, which includes multi-vendor environments, virtualization and automation, our strong track record of collaboration with clients and partners, and the combination of our expertise
in infrastructure management with skilled global resources in SAP, AG, Oracle Corporation and Microsoft Corporation platforms.

HP Software.

The areas in which HP Software operates are fueled by rapidly changing customer requirements and technologies. We market
enterprise IT
management software in competition with IBM, CA, Inc. ("CAI"), BMC Software, Inc. and others. Our information management and business intelligence solutions compete with products from companies
like Symantec Corporation, IBM, EMC, CAI, and Teradata Corporation. We also deliver communications and media solutions that compete with products from IBM and various other competitors. As new
delivery mechanisms such as software-as-a-service come on the scene, we are also confronting less traditional competitors. Our differentiation lies in the breadth
and depth of our software and services portfolio and the scope of our market coverage.

Personal Systems Group.

The areas in which PSG operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid price reductions and
inventory
depreciation. Our primary competitors for the branded personal computers are Dell, Acer Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Apple Inc., Lenovo Group Limited and Toshiba Corporation. In
particular regions, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or "white box" manufacturers. Our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio, our
innovation and research and development capabilities, our brand and procurement leverage, our ability to cross-sell our portfolio of offerings, our extensive service and support offerings
and the availability of our broad-based distribution of products from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.

Imaging and Printing Group.

The markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive, especially with respect to
pricing and
the introduction of new products and features. IPG's key competitors include Canon U.S.A., Inc., Lexmark International, Inc., Xerox Corporation, Seiko Epson Corporation, Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd. and Brother Industries, Ltd. In addition, independent suppliers offer refill and remanufactured alternatives for our supplies which, although generally
offering lower print quality and reliability, may be offered at lower prices and put pressure on our supplies sales and margins. Other companies also have developed and marketed new compatible
cartridges for HP's laser and inkjet products, particularly in jurisdictions outside of the United States where adequate intellectual property protection may not exist. In recent years, we and our
competitors have regularly lowered prices on printer hardware both to reach new customers and in response to the competitive environment. Important areas for future growth include printer-based
multi-function devices in the office space, digital presses in our imaging and graphics space and driving color printing expansion in the office. We believe we will continue to provide important new
contributions in the home, the office and publishing environments by providing comprehensive solutions.



HP Financial Services.

In our financing business, our competitors are captive financing companies, mainly IBM Global Financing, as well
as banks and
financial institutions. We believe our competitive advantage in this business over banks and financial institutions is our ability to finance products, services and total solutions.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors, see "Risk Factors—The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margin and prospects," in
Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Environment

Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including
laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial
costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.

Many
of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use, including laws regulating the manufacture
and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. Some of our products also are, or may in the future be, subject to requirements
applicable to their energy consumption. In addition, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical
and materials composition of our products, their safe use, and their energy efficiency, including requirements relating to climate change. We also are subject to legislation in an increasing number of
jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered
products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). In the event our products become non-compliant with these laws, they could be restricted from entering
certain jurisdictions, and we could face other sanctions, including fines.

Our
operations and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations and international treaties relating to
climate change. As these laws, regulations and treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially face market
access limitations or other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we
are collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that HP technology can be used address climate change and to facilitate compliance with these related laws,
regulations and treaties.

We
are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of
our business. We meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services.

The
liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when HP considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs. Environmental costs and accruals
are presently not material to our operations or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a
material adverse effect on HP's operations or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance may not be a
reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.



Competitive pressures could harm our revenue, gross margin and prospects.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors may target
our key market segments. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our
products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, availability of application software, and Internet infrastructure offerings. If our products, services, support and
cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our operations, results and prospects could be harmed.

Unlike
many of our competitors, we have a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of
these product lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources
available to them than our businesses that compete against them. Industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the
markets in which we compete, and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers. In addition, companies with
whom we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas. Those companies also may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us. Any
inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with strategic alliance partners could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

We
may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin. The
markets in which we do business, particularly the personal computer and printing markets, are highly competitive, and we encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services
from numerous companies globally. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers, printers and related products has been particularly intense as competitors have
aggressively cut prices and
lowered their product margins for these products. In addition, competitors in some of the markets in which we compete with a greater presence in lower-cost jurisdictions may be able to
offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.

Because
our business model is based on providing innovative and high quality products, we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our
competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and, therefore, our profitability could be
adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain
areas, which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects.

Even
if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry. Revenue and margins also could
decline due to increased competition from other types of products. For example, growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices and the development of cloud-based solutions may
reduce demand for some of our existing hardware products. In addition, refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of HP's LaserJet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with HP's supplies business.
Other companies have also developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for HP's LaserJet and inkjet products, particularly in jurisdictions outside of the United States where adequate intellectual
property protection may not exist.



If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may
suffer.

The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and
uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. For example,
we must successfully address the increasing market demand for mobile computing devices in a variety of form factors that provide a compelling user experience. We must also attract and retain
developers to ensure the continued availability and development of appealing and innovative software applications for our mobile computing devices. In addition, we are transitioning to an environment
characterized by cloud-based computing and software being delivered as a service, and we must continue to successfully develop and deploy cloud-based solutions for our customers. We must make
long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand
for our products and services. After we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low costs.
To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so at all or within a given product's
life cycle. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position.

In
the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and
manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in
product testing to determine the cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions. However, we may have limited ability to control quality issues, particularly with respect to faulty
components manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or "patch"), we may delay shipment to customers, which would
delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other
costs, adversely affecting our profits. If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products, our operating margins could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we
fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could adversely
affect our operating results.

Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin and expenses.

Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for computing and imaging products
and services in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and
difficulty managing inventory levels. Sustained uncertainty about current global economic conditions may adversely affect demand for our products and services. Economic weakness and uncertainty also
make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross margin and expenses.

We
also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross margin declines in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures, inventory
write downs and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that, as a result of competitive pricing
pressures or other factors, we are unable to pass on to our customers. In addition, our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment, parts and components from our
suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit.



Economic
weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any renewed financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or
any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times
of market volatility and disruption. Poor financial performance of asset markets could lead to increased pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Other income and expense could vary
materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, hedging expenses and the fair value of derivative instruments. Economic downturns also
may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses.

We depend on third-party suppliers, and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly.

Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services and our suppliers' ability to
deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical schedules. Given the wide variety of systems, products and services that
we offer, the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe, and the long lead times that are required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain
components and products, problems could arise in planning production and managing inventory levels that could seriously harm us. In addition, our ongoing project to improve the efficiency of our
supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess
supply, risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers, and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers, as described below.

•

Shortages.

Occasionally we may experience a shortage of,
or a delay in receiving, certain components as a result of strong demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets, disputes
with suppliers (some of whom are also customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new
suppliers. In particular, our PC business relies heavily upon OMs to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those OMs to fulfill demand for our PC
products. HP represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these OMs, and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by HP with a particular OM could adversely affect the
operations and financial condition of the OM and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that OM. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these components may increase, we may be
exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide
services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose time-sensitive sales, incur
additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to reengineer some products or service offerings,
resulting in further costs and delays.

•

Oversupply.

In order to secure components for the
provision of products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components
strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a
temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our gross margin.



•

Contractual terms.

As a result of binding price or
purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond
to changing market conditions. In the event that we become committed to purchase components or services for prices in excess of the current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who
have access to components or services at lower prices, and our gross margin could suffer. In addition, many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same OMs and suppliers that
we utilize. Our competitors may obtain better pricing and other terms and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, and our ability to engage in
relationships with certain OMs and suppliers could be limited. The practice employed by our PC business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its OMs may
create large supplier receivables with the OMs that, depending on the financial condition of the OMs, may have risk of uncollectability. In addition, certain of our OMs and suppliers may
decide in the future to discontinue conducting business with us. Any of these actions by our competitors, OMs or suppliers could adversely affect our future operating results and financial
condition.

•

Contingent workers.

We also rely on third-party suppliers
for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims
relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent
workers, as described above. Our ability to manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.

•

Single source suppliers.

Our use of single source
suppliers for certain components could exacerbate our supplier issues. We obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other
considerations. For example, we rely on Intel Corporation to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our PCs, workstations, handheld computing devices and servers, and some of
those processors are customized for our products. New products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need
for additional suppliers. Replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers initially may be subject to capacity constraints or other output
limitations. For some components, such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from Intel, alternative sources may not exist or those alternative sources may be unable to
produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under short-term
agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such
single source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of components to HP. The loss of a
single source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single
source supplier could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins.

Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.

Our worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis,
floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for



which
we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.
Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in
California and Asia, near major earthquake faults. In addition, all six of our principal worldwide IT data centers are located in the southern United States, making our operations more vulnerable to
natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical area. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are
concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Shanghai, Singapore and India. We also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in Asia to manufacture and distribute our products and in the
southwestern United States to import products into the Americas region. Our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for
any reason, including natural disasters, information technology system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The
ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our
revenue, profitability and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or other natural disaster.

System security risks, data protection breaches and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to
customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.

Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential
information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software
programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce
or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to
eliminate or alleviate security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in
interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss
of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.

We
manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. In addition, our outsourcing services business routinely processes,
stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent
disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our clients, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a
result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential
liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions
or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers' system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products. In addition, the cost and operational consequences
of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.

Portions
of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes
place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and
resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions
have adversely affected in the past, and in the future could adversely affect, our financial results, stock price and reputation.



The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable.

Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will
likely be different in future periods than our current results. Our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or reductions in IT spending could materially adversely
affect demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenues. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the
product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. In particular, IPG and certain of its business units such as printer supplies contribute significantly to our gross margin
and profitability. In addition, our services business has contributed significantly to our revenue and operating profit in recent periods. Competition, lawsuits, investigations and other risks
affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. Certain segments, and ESS in particular, have a higher fixed cost structure and more
variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis. In addition, newer
geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the
operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, competitive pressures, commoditization of
products, seasonal rebates, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given
period, which may necessitate adjustments to our operations.

HP's stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of HP's stock difficult to predict.

HP's stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. Some of the factors that could affect our stock price
are:

•

speculation in the press or investment community about, or actual changes in, our business, strategic position, market
share, organizational structure, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost cutting efforts, value or liquidity of our investments, exposure to market
volatility, prospects, business combination or investment transactions, or executive team;

•

the announcement of new products, services, technological innovations or acquisitions by HP or its competitors;

•

quarterly increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin, earnings or cash flow from operations, changes in estimates by
the investment community or guidance provided by HP, and variations between actual and estimated financial results;

•

announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by HP's competitors and other companies in the IT industry; and

•

the timing and amount of share repurchases by HP.

General
or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to HP's performance also may
affect the price of HP common stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In
addition, following periods of volatility in a company's securities, securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted. If instituted against HP, this type of litigation
could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.



Our revenue, cost of sales, and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third
parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements
with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the technology and products we sell, provide or otherwise use in our operations.
However, any of our direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take
advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other
competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to
protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this too could adversely affect our competitive position.

Because
of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by
third parties. We may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to
our intellectual property. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business
may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may
be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.

Third
parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. For example, individuals and groups frequently purchase
intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies such as HP. The number of these claims has increased
significantly in recent periods and may continue to increase in the future. If we cannot or do not license the infringed
technology at all or on reasonable terms, or substitute similar technology from another source, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that the claims are without merit, they
can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to
redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or
selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations to us.

Finally,
our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition, accrual and payment of
copyright levies or similar fees. In certain countries (primarily in Europe), proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving HP in which groups representing copyright owners sought to impose
upon and collect from HP levies upon equipment (such as PCs, MFDs and printers) alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws. Other such groups have also sought to modify existing levy schemes
to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from HP. Other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy schemes, and countries
that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices. The total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of products determined to be
subject to the levy, the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy, and the per unit fee for each type of product, all of which are affected by several factors,
including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving HP and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative



bodies
in the applicable countries, and could be substantial. Consequently, the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees, and the ability of HP to recover such amounts through
increased prices, remain uncertain.

Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition.

Sales outside the United States make up approximately 65% of our net revenue. In addition, an increasing portion of our business
activity is being conducted in emerging markets, including Brazil, Russia, India and China. Our future revenue, gross margin, expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of
international factors, including:

•

ongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation,
recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;

•

longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers;

•

trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products;

•

local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific HP suppliers and OMs;

•

managing a geographically dispersed workforce;

•

changes in the regulatory or legal environment;

•

differing technology standards or customer requirements;

•

import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments,
which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for
components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;

•

difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes
in tax laws; and

•

fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation
and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.

The
factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we rely on manufacturers in
Taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture.

As
approximately 65% of our sales are from countries outside of the United States, other currencies, particularly the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan renminbi and the Japanese yen,
can have an impact on HP's results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. Accordingly, fluctuations
in foreign currency rates, most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro, could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods. In addition, currency variations can adversely
affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States.
We use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. The effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to
accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and



services
and highly volatile exchange rates. As a result, we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities if our forecasts are incorrect. In addition, our hedging activities may be
ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our
revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition.

In
many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us,
such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. For example, as discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the German Public Prosecutor's Office, the U.S. Department of Justice
and the SEC have been investigating allegations that certain current and former employees of HP engaged in bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion or were involved in kickbacks or other improper
payments. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource
certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.

If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margin and profitability could suffer.

We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and both
direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for
our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery
model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability. Other distribution risks are described below.

•

Our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of
our channel partners were to weaken.

Our
future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels, the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or
the loss of retail shelf space. Moreover, some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions,
including economic weakness and industry consolidation. Many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures. Considerable
trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could
experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors' financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken.

•

Our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors.

We
must manage inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues. Distributors may increase orders during periods of
product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and
the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues, and
therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may
limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to



pricing
changes by competitors. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively.

If we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions, our revenue may suffer.

Many of the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance and software
features and functionality; frequent introduction of new products; short product life cycles; and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance. Among the
risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing, variations in costs, delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing
products in anticipation of new introductions, difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated
demand, risks associated with customer qualification and evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application
software. If we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings, our revenue may decline.

Our
revenue and gross margin also may suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors. This is especially challenging when a product has a
short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction. Furthermore, sales of our new products and services may replace sales, or result in discounting of
some of our current offerings, offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction. There also may be overlaps in the current products and services of HP and portfolios acquired through mergers
and acquisitions that we must manage. In addition, it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue, margin and cost estimates and to achieve
operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates. Given the competitive nature of our industry, if any of these risks materializes, future demand for our products and services and our results of
operations may suffer.

Our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our IT services business properly.

The size and significance of the IT services portion of our business has increased in recent periods. The risks that accompany that
business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following:

•

The pricing and other terms of some of our IT services agreements, particularly our long-term IT outsourcing
services agreements, require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated
delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable, which would have an
adverse affect on the profit margin of our IT services business.

•

Some of our IT services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered
through billings over the life of the agreement. These agreements often involve the construction of new IT systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies.
Substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics, and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the
development, construction and deployment phases. Any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability, result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation,
which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our IT services business.



•

Some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study
by a mutually acceptable third party. The benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a
peer comparison group, subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors. Generally, if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range, and the
difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client, then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing. This may result in the reduction of our rates
for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments, which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our IT services business.

If we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations, our revenue could suffer.

Our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with
federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and
performance. Any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil
and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future
government contracting. In addition, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to

qui tam

litigation brought by private individuals on
behalf of the government relating to our government contracts, which could include claims for up to treble damages. Further, any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings
surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. If our customer contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from
government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, we could suffer a reduction in expected revenue.

We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of HP's Consolidated Financial Statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could
adversely affect our results of operations.

In connection with the preparation of HP's Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on
historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this report.
In addition, as discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other
contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should
any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations.

Unanticipated changes in HP's tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.

We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by
the amounts we charge for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items in intercompany transactions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may
disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to
determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon



resolution
of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash
flows. In addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax
rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the
carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, President Obama's
administration has announced proposals for other U.S. tax legislation that, if adopted, could adversely affect our tax rate. There are also other tax proposals that have been introduced, that are
being considered, or that have been enacted by the United States Congress or the legislative bodies in foreign jurisdictions that could affect our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets,
or our other tax liabilities. For example, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has enacted tax legislation effective on January 1, 2011 that, in certain situations, would impose a new, temporary
excise tax relating to our non-Puerto Rican subsidiaries that sell products manufactured by our Puerto Rican subsidiaries. Any of these changes could affect our profitability.

Our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.

In some of our segments, our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's
total sales occur towards the end of such quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult,
increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially
greater than orders, there will be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of
each quarter. Other developments late in a quarter,
such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions, could adversely impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is
disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.

We
experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition. For example, sales to governments
(particularly sales to the United States government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal
and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year.
European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. Moreover, to the extent
that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches.
Typically, our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.

Any failure by us to execute on our strategy for operational efficiency successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected.

We have adopted an operating framework that includes a disciplined focus on operational efficiency. As part of this framework, we have
adopted several initiatives, including a multi-year program announced in 2006 to reduce real estate costs by consolidating several hundred HP real estate locations worldwide to fewer core
sites, and a multi-year process of examining every function and every one of our businesses and functions in order to optimize efficiency and reduce cost. We have also



implemented
a workforce restructuring program in fiscal 2008 relating to our acquisition of Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS"), a workforce restructuring program in fiscal 2009 relating to
our product businesses and a multi-year restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal 2010 relating to our enterprise services business.

Our
ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions, including
estimates and assumptions regarding the cost of consolidating real estate locations, the amount of accelerated depreciation or asset impairment to be incurred when we vacate facilities or cease using
equipment before the end of their respective lease term or asset life, and the costs and timing of other activities in connection with these initiatives. These estimates and assumptions are subject to
significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, there are significant risks associated with our workforce restructuring programs,
including potential delays in the implementation of those programs in highly regulated locations outside of the United States, particularly in Europe and
Asia, decreases in employee morale, and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other
unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial,
technical, sales, marketing and IT support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, skilled solutions providers in the IT support business and qualified sales representatives
are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the IT industry can be intense. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace,
we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash and share-based compensation. Our primary form of share-based incentive award is performance-based restricted stock units, which
contain conditions relating to HP's long-term financial and stock price performance that makes the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such share-based
incentive awards does not materialize, if our share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our
ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened. The failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees
could have a significant impact on our operations.

Terrorist acts, conflicts and wars may seriously harm our business and revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts or wars (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to HP, our employees, facilities,
partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers. The potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other
actual or potential conflicts or wars, including the ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have created many economic and political uncertainties. In addition, as a major multinational
company with headquarters and significant operations located in the United States, actions against or by the United States may impact our business or employees. Although it is impossible to predict
the occurrences or consequences of any such events, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive
components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and
interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.



Any failure by us to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results,
business and prospects, and the costs, expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing, completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are
different than expected.

As part of our business strategy, we frequently acquire complementary companies or businesses, divest non-core businesses
or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business (collectively, "business combination and investment transactions"). In order to pursue this
strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage
post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment
transaction, and the timeframe for achieving benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, suppliers or other third parties. In
addition, the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and,
during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate our costs accurately. Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to meet
contractual obligations could make these transactions less profitable or unprofitable. Moreover, if we fail to identify and successfully complete
business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive
disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin and profitability.

Integration
issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. The challenges
involved in integration include:

•

combining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;

•

convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus,
preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers (which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer
uncertainty), minimizing sales force attrition and coordinating sales, marketing and distribution efforts;

•

consolidating and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various
acquisitions and integrating software code;

•

minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;

•

persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees,
engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired company's non-U.S. employees, integrating employees into HP, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing
restructuring programs;

•

coordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries,
facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;

•

achieving savings from supply chain integration; and

•

managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.

Managing
business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. These business
combination



and
investment transactions also have resulted, and in the future may result, in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement
costs, employee benefit costs, asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, in-process research and development charges, inventory
adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans. Moreover, HP
has incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment transactions, and,
to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required
to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. In order to complete an acquisition, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for existing
stockholders. In addition, we may borrow to finance an acquisition, and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisition-related borrowings, as well as other factors, could affect our
liquidity and financial condition and potentially our credit ratings. Any potential future downgrades in our credit rating associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow
and cost of borrowing and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. In addition, HP's effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and business combination and investment transactions could
impact our effective tax rate. We also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a business combination and investment transaction and the risk that an announced business
combination and investment transaction may not close. As a result, any completed, pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment community's
expectations in a given quarter.

Unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws
addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of our products and the
recycling, treatment and disposal of our products including batteries. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future
requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change laws and regulations, and product
take-back legislation. We could incur substantial costs, our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and we could face other sanctions, if we were to violate or
become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws. Our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party
property damage, personal injury claims and clean up costs. Further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively, on a joint and several basis,
and without any finding of noncompliance or fault. The amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict.

Some anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.

We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or
discouraging an acquisition of HP deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions:

•

authorizing blank check preferred stock, which HP could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior
to our common stock;

•

limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, HP's directors and officers;



•

specifying that HP stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and
otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;

•

requiring advance notice of proposals by HP stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for
nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors;

•

requiring a vote by the holders of two-thirds of HP's outstanding shares to amend certain bylaws relating to
HP stockholder meetings, the Board of Directors and indemnification; and

•

controlling the procedures for conduct of HP Board and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of HP
directors.

These
provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or management of HP. As a Delaware corporation, HP also is subject to
provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of
the holders of substantially all of HP's outstanding common stock.

Any
provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of HP could limit the opportunity for our
stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of HP common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for HP common stock.

ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

Not applicable.

ITEM 2. Properties.

As of October 31, 2010, we owned or leased a total of approximately 80 million square feet of space worldwide. We owned
45% of this space and leased the remaining 55%. Included in these amounts are 14 million square feet of vacated space, of which 2 million square feet is leased to non-HP interests. We
believe that our existing properties are in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business.

As
of October 31, 2010, HP core sales and support operations occupied approximately 10 million square feet. We own 34% of the space used for sales and support activities
and lease the remaining 66%.

HP
core manufacturing plants, research and development facilities and warehouse and administrative facilities occupied approximately 56 million square feet. We own 45% of our
manufacturing, research and development, warehouse and administrative space and lease the remaining 55%. Our plants are equipped with machinery, most of which we own and which, in part, we developed
to meet the special requirements of our manufacturing processes. We continue to execute on our plan to reduce our real estate costs and increase our productive utilization by consolidating into
several hundred HP core real estate locations worldwide.

As
mentioned above in Item 1. Business, we have seven business segments: Services, ESS, HP Software, PSG, IPG, HPFS, and Corporate Investments. Because of the interrelation of
these segments, a majority of these segments use substantially all of the properties at least in part, and we retain the flexibility to use each of the properties in whole or in part for each of the
segments.

repurchased shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 under an ongoing program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans as well as to repurchase
shares opportunistically. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. All shares repurchased in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2010 were purchased in open market transactions.

As
of October 31, 2010, HP had remaining authorization of $10.9 billion for future share repurchases under the $8.0 billion and $10.0 billion repurchase
authorizations approved by HP's Board of Directors on November 19, 2009 and August 29, 2010, respectively.

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere in this document.

OVERVIEW

We are a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and
medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. Our offerings span:

•

multi-vendor customer services, including infrastructure technology and business process outsourcing, technology support
and maintenance, application development and support services, and consulting and integration services;

•

enterprise information technology infrastructure, including enterprise storage and server technology, networking products
and solutions, information management software and software that optimizes business technology investments;

•

personal computing and other access devices; and

•

imaging and printing-related products and services.

We
have seven business segments for financial reporting purposes: Services, Enterprise Storage and Servers ("ESS"), HP Software, the Personal Systems Group ("PSG"), the Imaging and
Printing Group ("IPG"), HP Financial Services ("HPFS"), and Corporate Investments. Services, ESS and HP Software are reported collectively as a broader HP Enterprise Business. While the HP Enterprise
Business is not an operating segment, we sometimes provide financial data aggregating the segments within it in order to provide a supplementary view of our business.

Our
strategy and operations are currently focused on the following initiatives:

Competitive Positioning

We are positioning our businesses to take advantage of important trends in the markets for our products and services. For example, we
are aligning our printing business to capitalize on key market trends such as the shift from analog to digital printing and the growth in printable content by developing innovative products for
consumers such as the first web-connected home printer, working to enable web and mobile printing, expanding our presence in high-usage annuity businesses including graphics
and retail publishing printing, and growing our managed print services business. We are also positioning our enterprise business to capitalize on the trend towards converged infrastructure products
that integrate storage, networking, servers and management software, while also delivering services for that converged infrastructure in a manner that best fits each client's needs, be it at a client
site, as an outsourced service via the Internet or via a hybrid approach. In addition, we have developed IT management software offerings that seek to satisfy the increasing demand for virtualization
management and increased automation.

Driving Operational Efficiency

We are working to optimize efficiency across the company. As part of those efforts, we are continuing to execute on our
multi-year program to consolidate real estate locations worldwide to fewer



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

core
sites in order to reduce our IT spending and real estate costs. We are also continuing to implement the restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 to optimize the cost
structure of our Services business and the restructuring plan announced in May 2009 to structurally change and improve the effectiveness of several of our product businesses. In June 2010, we
announced and started implementing a new restructuring plan that will consolidate data centers, systems and tools to better position for growth our enterprise services business, which includes our
infrastructure technology outsourcing, application services, and business process outsourcing business units. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for further
discussion of these restructuring plans and the associated restructuring charges.

Investing for Growth

We are investing for growth by strengthening our position in our core markets and accelerating growth in adjacent markets in
anticipation of market trends, such as data center consolidation and automation, cloud computing and virtualization, digitization, IT security, and mobility and connectivity. For example, we are
increasing our sales coverage and investing in our sales channels to better address the markets we cover, including further expansion in emerging markets. We are creating innovative new products and
developing new channels to connect with our customers. In addition, we have been making focused investments in innovation to strengthen our portfolio of products and services that we can offer to our
customers, both through acquisitions and through organic growth. A critical component of this strategy was our acquisition of Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") in August 2008, which has
increased the size and breadth of our services business and enabled us to provide comprehensive IT product and services solutions to our customers. In addition, with the completion of the acquisition
of 3Com Corporation ("3Com") in April 2010, we are accelerating our investments in networking. In July 2010, we completed the acquisition of Palm, Inc. ("Palm"), which enhances our ability to
participate more aggressively in the growing smartphone and connected mobile device markets. In September 2010, we completed the acquisition of 3PAR Inc. ("3PAR"), which expands our storage
portfolio into enterprise-class public and private cloud computing environments. In October 2010, we completed the acquisition of ArcSight, Inc. ("ArcSight"), which enables us to offer customers an
integrated security platform with a holistic approach to securing their networks, applications and sensitive data. These acquisitions have enabled us to expand in high-margin and
high-growth industry segments and have further strengthened our portfolio of hardware, software and services.

Leveraging our Portfolio and Scale

We now offer one of the IT industry's broadest portfolios of products and services, and we leverage that portfolio to our strategic
advantage. For example, in our enterprise business, we are able to provide servers, storage and networking products packaged with services that can be delivered to customers in the manner of their
choosing, be it in-house, outsourced as a service via the Internet or via a hybrid environment. Our portfolio of management software completes the package by allowing our customers to
manage their IT operations in an efficient and cost-effective manner. In addition, we are working to optimize our supply chain by eliminating complexity, reducing fixed costs, and
leveraging our scale to ensure the availability of components at favorable prices even during shortages. We are also expanding our use of industry standard components in our enterprise products to
further leverage our scale.

Cash and cash equivalents at October 31, 2010 totaled $10.9 billion, a decrease of $2.4 billion from the October 31,
2009 balance of $13.3 billion. The decrease for fiscal 2010 was due primarily to $11.0 billion of cash used to repurchase common stock, $8.1 billion of net cash paid for business
acquisitions, and $3.5 billion net investment in property, plant and equipment, all of which were partially offset by $11.9 billion of cash provided from operations, $6.0 billion
of increased net borrowings, and $2.6 billion of proceeds related to issuance of common stock under employee stock plans.

We
intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements,
the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and
estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment.

For
a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results, see the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

General

The Consolidated Financial Statements of HP are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"),
which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Senior management has discussed the



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

development,
selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of HP's Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are
reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

The
summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. An accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it
requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if
changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates
and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and, while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and
conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine
the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if
so, how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered elements have standalone
value, uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customer-negotiated refund or return rights for the delivered elements. If the arrangement includes a
customer-negotiated refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control, the
delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting.
Changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.

We
recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixed price contracts, such as consulting arrangements. Using a proportional performance method, we estimate the total expected labor
costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date. We follow this basis because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be
made. Total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of the contract. We record changes in revenue to income, as a result of revisions to cost estimates, in the period in which the
facts that give rise to the revision become known.

We
recognize revenue on certain design and build (design, development and/or constructions of software and/or systems) projects using the percentage-of-completion
method. We use the cost-to-cost method of measurement towards completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project.
In circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made, we recognize revenue using the completed contract method.

We
record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, promotions, other volume-based incentives and
expected returns. Future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at
the time the incentive is offered. Additionally, certain incentive programs require us to estimate, based on historical experience



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

and
the specific terms and conditions of the incentive, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive.

Under
our current revenue recognition policies, which were applied in fiscal 2010 and 2009, we establish vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price using
the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. Third-party evidence of selling
price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. The best estimate of selling price ("ESP")
is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is also given to
market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles. When determining our best estimate of selling price, we apply management judgment when establishing margin
objectives and pricing strategies and evaluating market conditions and product life cycles. We may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future. As these
go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting both VSOE and ESP. The
aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements from the current fiscal year, which may change the pattern and timing of
revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.

For
2008, pursuant to the previous guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, HP allocated revenue to each element based on relative fair value, or, for software,
based on VSOE of fair value.

Warranty Provision

We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a
product group basis. Our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of
time. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty
obligation upon warranty terms, ongoing product failure rates, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, and current period product shipments. If actual product failure rates, repair
rates or any other post sales support costs were to differ from our estimates, we would be required to make revisions to the estimated warranty liability. Warranty terms generally range from
90 days to three years for parts and labor, depending upon the product. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty provision has averaged approximately 3.5% of annual net product
revenue, while actual annual warranty costs have experienced favorable trends and averaged approximately 3.3% of annual net product revenue.

Business Combinations

We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets
acquired, including in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill. We
engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates
and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Critical
estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, distribution agreements, and
acquired developed technologies and patents; expected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed; brand awareness and market
position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio; and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.

Other
estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more
fully discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Valuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The provisions of the accounting standard for goodwill and other intangibles require that we perform a
two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. In general, our reporting units are consistent with the
reportable segments identified in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. However, for certain businesses within Corporate Investments, the reporting unit is one step
below the segment level. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting
unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the
fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value
of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value
of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We also compare the
fair value of purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives to their carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach. We recognize an impairment loss
when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.

Determining
the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates,
future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and
inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the
carrying values for each of our reporting units.

Our
annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of fair value over carrying value
for each of HP's reporting units as of August 1, 2010, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

$760 million
to approximately $33 billion. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to
the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $360 million to approximately
$29 billion for each of HP's reporting units.

Restructuring

We have engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates
related to the timing and the expenses for severance and other employee separation costs, realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete, lease cancellation and other exit costs. If the actual
amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. For a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions of restructuring
in the Results of Operations section and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

We recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. We recognize
compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.

Determining
the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards requires subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share-based
payment awards and stock price volatility. We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the stock options granted under our principal option plans. To implement this model, we examined
our historical pattern of option exercises to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations. From this analysis, we identified three employee
populations to which to apply the Black-Scholes model. We determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on HP common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility
and future stock price trends than historical volatility.

We
issue performance-based restricted units ("PRUs") representing hypothetical shares of HP common stock. Each PRU award reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the
award recipient. We determine the actual number of shares the recipient receives at the end of a three-year performance period based on results achieved versus goals based on our annual
cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue and total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to the S&P 500 over the performance period. We use historic volatility for PRU awards as
implied volatility cannot be used when simulating multivariate prices for companies in the S&P 500. We estimate the fair value of PRUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as the TSR
modifier contains a market condition. We update the estimated expense, net of forfeitures, for the cash flow performance against the goal for that year at the end of each reporting period.

The
assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the
application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we
are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the
stock-based compensation



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

expense
could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion on
stock-based compensation.

Taxes on Earnings

We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions
reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. We record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and
finalized them, which is generally in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions, respectively.

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely
than not to realize.

We
have considered future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning
strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would
increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to
realize the net deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to
generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

Our
effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided U.S. taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely
outside the United States. We plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long-term investment requirements of our
foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we will distribute to the United States and provide the U.S. federal taxes due on these amounts.
Further, as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some
cases is wholly exempt from taxes, for fiscal years through 2024. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various
jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate.

We
are subject to income taxes in the United States and approximately eighty foreign countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions.
We believe that our tax return positions are fully supported, but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions, which may not be fully sustained. However, our income tax expense includes
amounts intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and
liabilities requires management judgments and estimates. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. We believe that our
reserve for uncertain tax positions, including related interest, is adequate. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included
in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. Our reserve



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

for
uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions,
and related interest. We review our reserves quarterly, and we may adjust such reserves because of proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new
regulations or new case law, previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination, negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer
prices, execution of Advanced Pricing Agreements, resolution with respect to individual audit issues, the resolution of entire audits, or the expiration of statutes of limitations.

See
Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion on taxes on earnings.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we have not overstated our trade and
financing receivables balances due to uncollectibility. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all customers based on a variety of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk
models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, the financial condition of customers, the length of time receivables are past due, trends in overall
weighted-average risk rating of the total portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, significant one-time events and historical experience. Also, we record specific provisions for individual
accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances
related to customers change, we would further adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables either upward or downward. The annual provision for doubtful accounts has averaged approximately
0.03% of net revenue over the last three fiscal years. Using our third-party credit risk model at October 31, 2010, a 50-basis-point deterioration in the weighted-average default
probabilities of our significant customers would have resulted in an approximately $64 million increase to our trade allowance at the end of fiscal year 2010.

Inventory

We state our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value,
if required, at the product group level for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, rapid technological changes, product
life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues. Revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our
estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on valuation techniques using the best information available,
which may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Financial instruments are primarily comprised of time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper,
corporate and other debt securities, equity securities and other investments in common stock and common stock equivalents and derivative instruments.

Cash
Equivalents and Investments: We hold time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, other debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and
bonds, and

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

common
stock and equivalents. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. If quoted prices in active markets for identical
assets are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. If quoted prices for
identical or similar assets are not available, we use internally developed valuation models, whose inputs include bid prices, and third party valuations utilizing underlying asset assumptions.

Derivative
Instruments: As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we mainly hold non-speculative forwards, swaps and options
to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. When active market quotes are not available, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future
cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for
currencies. In certain cases,
market-based observable inputs are not available and, in those cases, we use management judgment to develop assumptions which are used to determine fair value.

Retirement Benefits

Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions. Our major
assumptions relate primarily to discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. We base the discount rate assumption on current investment
yields of high quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual experience and future and
near-term outlook. Long-term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management's expectation of the future economic environment, as well
as target asset allocations.

Our
medical cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Actual results
that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants.

Our
major assumptions vary by plan and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated
herein by reference. Each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics, and, in general, changes, if any, have moved in the same direction over the last several years. For fiscal 2010, changes
in the weighted-average rates for the HP benefit plans would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost:

•

A decrease of 25 basis points in the long-term rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by
approximately $50 million;

•

A decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately
$65 million; and

•

An increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately
$24 million.

Loss Contingencies

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record a
provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant

judgment
is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations,
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should
any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. See Note 18 to
the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion of litigation and contingencies.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. It eliminates the
quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary
beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This new standard also requires additional disclosures about an enterprise's involvement in variable interest entities. We will adopt this new accounting
standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

CONSTANT CURRENCY PRESENTATION

Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our
overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework for assessing how each of our business segments performed excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the
year-over-year percentage change in revenue performance on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in the exchange rate from the prior-year period. This
constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on an as-reported basis.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a GAAP basis for the fiscal years ended October 31,
2010, 2009, and 2008. Unless otherwise noted, all comparative performance data included below reflect year-over-year comparisons.

Fiscal 2010

In
fiscal 2010, total HP net revenue increased 10% (8.3% on a constant currency basis). U.S. net revenue increased 7.8% to $44.5 billion, while net
revenue from outside of the United States increased 11.3% to $81.5 billion. As reflected in the table above, the PSG segment was the largest contributor to HP net revenue growth as a result of
balanced growth across the regions. An analysis of the change in net revenue for each business segment is included under "Segment Information" below.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Fiscal 2009

In
fiscal 2009, the global slowdown of IT and consumer spending impacted each of our segments. Net revenue decreased 3.2% in fiscal 2009 (increased 1.3% on a
constant currency basis). The unfavorable currency impact for fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro. For fiscal 2009, the Services segment contributed favorably
to the total HP net revenue change primarily as a result of the EDS acquisition. U.S. net revenue increased 12% to $41.3 billion for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, while net revenue
from outside of the United States decreased 10% to $73.2 billion. The increase in U.S. net revenue in fiscal 2009 was primarily a result of the acquisition of EDS. An analysis of the change in
net revenue for each business segment is included under "Segment Information" below.

Gross Margin

Fiscal 2010

In
fiscal 2010, total HP gross margin increased by 0.2 percentage points. The increase was a result of an increased mix in networking products and rate
increase in Services, the effect of which was partially offset by strong revenue growth in personal computers and printer hardware that have lower gross margins.

Services
gross margin increased in fiscal 2010 due primarily to the continued focus on operating improvements, including delivery efficiencies and cost controls in our technology
services business, and EDS-related acquisition synergies.

ESS
gross margin declined in fiscal 2010 due primarily to a product mix shift resulting from the strength in industry standard servers ("ISS"), the effect of which was partially offset
by lower product costs and strong volume.

HP
Software gross margin increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of a higher license and support mix, the effect of which was partially offset by a reduced services gross margin
rate.

PSG
gross margin declined in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of higher component costs, the effect of which was partially offset by lower warranty and logistics expenses.

IPG
gross margin declined in fiscal 2010 due primarily to a higher mix of hardware and a correspondingly lower mix of supplies, the effect of which was partially offset by cost savings
associated with our ongoing efforts to optimize our supply chain.

HPFS
gross margin increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of higher portfolio margins due to favorable financing conditions and higher remarketing margin, the effect of which was
partially offset by higher bad debt.

Corporate
Investments gross margin increased in fiscal 2010 primarily as a result of the impact from the 3Com acquisition along with lower product costs for our network infrastructure
products.

Fiscal 2009

Total
HP gross margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points in fiscal 2009. From a segment perspective and on a weighted basis, ESS had the largest impact
to the total company gross margin decline due to product mix shift and rate declines.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Services
gross margin increased in fiscal 2009 due primarily to the continued focus on cost structure improvements, including delivery efficiencies and cost controls in our technology
services business, and EDS-related acquisition synergies. This was partially offset by the mix effect from the acquisition of the EDS business, which has lower gross margins.

ESS
gross margin decreased in fiscal 2009 due primarily to competitive pricing across each of the segment business units and product mix shifts.

HP
Software gross margin increased in fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of favorable support and services revenue mix and improved services margins, the effect of which was partially
offset by an unfavorable license revenue mix.

PSG
gross margin declined in fiscal 2009, resulting from average selling prices ("ASPs") declining at a faster pace than component costs combined with a mix shift towards
lower-end products, the effects of which were partially offset by lower warranty and supply chain costs and improvements in the option attach rate.

IPG
gross margin improved in fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of an increase in the supplies mix and supplies pricing, the effect of which was partially offset by hardware margin
declines.

HPFS
gross margin declined in fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of unfavorable currency impacts, lower margins relating to end-of-lease activities, higher bad
debt expenses and lower margins for remarketing and buyout activities, the effect of which was partially offset by higher portfolio margins.

Corporate
Investments gross margin declined in fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of a unit volume decline in the sale of network infrastructure products and competitive pricing
pressures.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

Total
research and development ("R&D") expense increased in fiscal 2010 due primarily to additional expenses from acquired companies. In fiscal 2010, R&D
expense as a percentage of net revenue increased for Corporate Investments, HP Software and Services, decreased for ESS, PSG, and IPG and was flat for HPFS.

Total
R&D expense decreased in fiscal 2009 due primarily to favorable currency impacts related to the movement of the dollar against the euro, as well as effective cost controls, the
effect of which was partially offset by additional expenses related primarily to Services. In fiscal 2009, R&D expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased for ESS, PSG, and IPG, and increased for
HP Software, Services and Corporate Investments.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling,
general and administrative ("SG&A") expense increased in fiscal 2010 due primarily to higher field selling and marketing costs as a result of our
investments in sales resources to grow revenue. In fiscal 2010, SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenue increased for Corporate Investments and IPG, and decreased for ESS, HP Software, PSG, HPFS
and Services even as we invested in incremental sales resources across the segments.

Total
SG&A expense decreased in fiscal 2009 due primarily to favorable currency impacts related to the movement of the dollar against the euro, lower compensation expense as well as
effective cost



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

management,
the impact of which was partially offset by additional expenses related to the EDS acquisition. In fiscal 2009, SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased for each of our
segments, except for Corporate Investments.

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets

The
decrease in amortization expense in fiscal 2010 was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their
amortization periods, the effect of which was partially offset by increased amortization of purchased intangible assets from acquisitions completed during fiscal 2010.

The
increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to amortization expenses related to the intangible assets purchased as part of the EDS acquisition.

For
more information on our amortization of purchased intangibles assets, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Restructuring

Restructuring
charges for fiscal 2010 were $1.1 billion. These charges included $650 million of severance and facility costs related to our
fiscal 2010 enterprise services restructuring plan, $429 million of severance and facility costs related to our fiscal 2008 restructuring plan, $46 million and $18 million
associated with the Palm and 3Com restructuring plans, respectively, and an increase of $1 million related to adjustments to other restructuring plans.

Restructuring
charges for fiscal 2009 were $640 million. These charges included $346 million of severance and facility costs related to our fiscal 2008 restructuring plan,
$297 million of severance costs associated with our fiscal 2009 restructuring plan, and a reduction of $3 million related to adjustments to other restructuring plans.

Restructuring
charges for fiscal 2008 were $270 million, which included $246 million of charges due primarily to severance and facility costs related to the EDS acquisition
and a net charge of $24 million relating to adjustments for existing restructuring programs.

For
more information on our restructuring charges, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

As
part of our ongoing business operations, we incurred workforce rebalancing charges for severance and related costs within certain business segments in fiscal 2010. Workforce
rebalancing activities are considered part of normal operations as we continue to optimize our cost structure. Workforce rebalancing costs are included in our business segment results, and we expect
to incur additional workforce rebalancing costs in the future.

Acquisition-Related Charges

In
fiscal 2010, we recorded acquisition-related charges of $293 million primarily for consulting and integration costs, acquisition costs and retention
bonuses associated with the EDS, 3Com, Palm, 3PAR and ArcSight acquisitions.

In
fiscal 2009, we recorded acquisition-related charges of $242 million primarily for consulting and integration costs as well as retention bonuses associated with the EDS
acquisition.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Interest and Other, Net

Interest and other, net improved by $216 million in fiscal 2010. The improvement was driven primarily by lower currency losses
on balance sheet remeasurement items,
lower interest expenses on debt balances due to lower interest rates, and a value-added tax refund, the effect of which was partially offset by an increase to our litigation accruals.

Interest
and other, net decreased by $721 million in fiscal 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by higher interest expenses due to higher average debt balances principally
related to the EDS acquisition, lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates, and higher currency losses on balance sheet remeasurement items. Additionally, there were higher gains from
the sale of real estate in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2009.

Provision for Taxes

Our effective tax rates were 20.2%, 18.6% and 20.5% in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. HP's effective tax rate generally
differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from HP's operations in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world. HP has
not provided U.S. taxes for all of its international earnings because HP plans to reinvest some of those earnings indefinitely outside the United States.

The
increase in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2010 was due primarily to a decrease in the income tax benefits related to foreign earnings.

The
decrease in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the net income tax benefits recorded for fiscal 2009 which were related to foreign net operating losses,
adjustments to estimated fiscal 2008 tax accruals upon filing the 2008 income tax returns, valuation allowance reversals for state and foreign net operating losses, and other miscellaneous items.

For
a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our provision for taxes, see Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Segment Information

A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each segment can be found in Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is
incorporated herein by reference. We have realigned segment financial data for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2009 and 2008 to reflect changes in HP's organizational structure that occurred
at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We describe these changes more fully in Note 19. We have presented the business segments in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K based on the distinct nature of various businesses such as customer base, homogeneity of products and technology. The discussions below include the results of each of our
segments.

HP Enterprise Business

Services, ESS and HP Software are reported collectively as a broader HP Enterprise Business. We describe the results of the business
segments of the HP Enterprise Business in more detail below.

net revenue increased 0.7% (decreased 1.7% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2010. Net revenue in infrastructure technology outsourcing increased by 2.6% in fiscal 2010. The
revenue increase was due to favorable currency impact and growth in data center services and networking services. Net revenue in technology services declined by 0.4% in fiscal 2010. The revenue
decline was due primarily to lower contract revenue tied to reduced levels of enterprise hardware sales in the prior-year period and market conditions in the current-year
period, the effect of which was partially offset by a favorable currency impact. Net revenue in application services decreased by 1.1% in fiscal 2010. The revenue decrease was driven primarily by
market conditions and existing contract completion, the effect of which was partially offset by new business and a favorable currency impact. Net revenue in business process outsourcing decreased by
3.5% in fiscal 2010. The revenue decrease was due primarily to a divestiture completed at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and economic conditions in certain industries with key clients,
the effect of which was partially offset by a favorable currency impact.

Services
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.6 percentage points in fiscal 2010. Operating margin increased primarily due to continued focus on
operating improvements and cost initiatives that favorably impacted the cost structure of our enterprise services business, delivery efficiencies and cost controls in our technology services business,
as well as EDS-related acquisition synergies.

Services
net revenue increased 65.4% (71.6% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2009. The increase in revenues is due primarily to the acquisition of EDS on August 26, 2008. Net
revenue in infrastructure technology outsourcing, application services and business process outsourcing increased due to the EDS acquisition. The net revenue increase in infrastructure technology
outsourcing, application services, and business process outsourcing was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and a decline in spending from existing customers not being offset with new
growth due to slowing demand in the current economic environment. Application services and business process outsourcing were impacted to a greater degree than infrastructure technology outsourcing.

in
technology services declined due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and weak economic conditions, the effect of which was partially offset by growth in extended warranty.

Services
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 2.5 percentage points in fiscal 2009. The operating margin increased due primarily to a decrease in
operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. There was also an increase in gross margin for fiscal 2009. Operating expense declined as a result of a continued focus on cost structure improvements
from overall cost controls. The gross margin in our Services segment increased for fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due primarily to the continued focus on cost structure improvements, including delivery
efficiencies and cost controls in our technology services business, and EDS-related acquisition synergies. This was partially offset by the mix effect from the acquisition of the EDS
business, which has lower gross margins.

driven primarily by unit volume growth coupled with increased average unit prices due to improving market conditions and demand for the latest generation of ISS products. Storage net revenue increased
by 9% in fiscal 2010, driven primarily by strong performance in products related to our acquisition of Lefthand Networks, and growth in high-end disk products and storage networking
products. Business critical systems ("BCS") net revenue decreased 12%, due primarily to market conditions and competitive pressures, the effect of which was partially offset by new product
introductions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010.

ESS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 3.0 percentage points in fiscal 2010, driven by decreases in operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenue, the effect of which was partially offset by declines in gross margin. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased as a result of operating leverage benefits from increased
volume and cost controls. The gross margin decline in fiscal 2010 was due primarily to a product mix shift resulting from the strength in ISS, the effect of which was partially offset by lower product
costs and strong volume.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

ESS
net revenue decreased 20.8% (16.0% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2009. The revenue decline was due primarily to the economic slowdown and overall weak demand environment. ISS
net revenue declined 20% in fiscal 2009 due to declines in unit volume. ISS average unit prices declined in fiscal 2009 while improving in the second half of fiscal 2009 as a result of a new product
ramp up. Total ESS blades revenue declined by 2% in fiscal 2009. BCS net revenue decreased 27% in fiscal 2009 driven by a decline in Integrity server revenue due to weaker market conditions and by the
planned phase-out of the PA-RISC and Alpha Server product lines. Storage net revenue declined 17% in fiscal 2009 due to a decline in disk and tape products as a result of a
weaker demand environment, the effects of which were partially offset by revenue resulting from the acquisition of Lefthand Networks, which was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.

In
fiscal 2009, ESS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 3.4 percentage points, due primarily to a decline in gross margin. Gross margin in fiscal
2009 decreased due primarily to competitive pricing across each of the segment business units and product mix shifts. Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2009 was generally
consistent with the fiscal 2008.

Net revenue from business technology optimization increased 2% in fiscal 2010, due to growth in support and license renewals. Net revenue from our other software businesses decreased 3% in fiscal
2010, due to a decline in revenue from sales of communication and media solutions resulting from market conditions in the Asia Pacific region and EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa). The revenue
increase in information management was due primarily to increases in license and support revenue. The revenue increase in business intelligence solutions was primarily a result of increases in support
and services.

HP
Software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 2.1 percentage points in fiscal 2010. The operating margin improvement in fiscal 2010 was due

in
gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2010 was primarily a result of a higher license and support mix, the effect
of which was partially offset by a reduced services gross margin rate. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2010 was due primarily to lower field selling,

Software net revenue decreased 15.4% (10.8% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2009, due to softening in enterprise spending and declines in large deals. For fiscal 2009, revenue
from licenses and
services declined, the effect of which was partially offset by increased support revenue as a result of renewal rate increases. Net revenue from BTO decreased 15% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal
2008. Net revenue from other software decreased 17% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, due to declines in revenues for communication and media solutions, business intelligence solutions and
information management.

HP
Software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 7.3 percentage points in fiscal 2009. The operating margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was due
primarily to increased gross margin coupled with decreased operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from a favorable support
and services revenue mix and improved services margins, the effect of which was partially offset by an unfavorable license revenue mix. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenue in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to continued cost controls.

net revenue for consumer clients increased 12% while commercial client revenue increased 20%. Net revenue in Other increased 6% due primarily to increased sales of calculators, home servers and
warranty extensions. For fiscal 2010, the favorable impact on PSG net revenue from unit increases was accompanied by a 1% increase in ASPs.

PSG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 0.3 percentage points in fiscal 2010. The increase was driven by improvements in operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenue, the effect of which was offset partially by a slight decline in gross margins. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to effective cost
controls and operating leverage benefits from increased volume. The decrease in gross margins was a result of higher component costs, the effect of which was partially offset by lower warranty and
logistics expenses.

PSG
net revenue decreased 16.5% (11.6% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2009. The revenue decline was primarily the result of the overall slowdown in the global economy. Despite the
overall regional declines, revenue in China increased for fiscal 2009. PSG net revenue decreased across all businesses in fiscal 2009. Unit volume increased slightly in fiscal 2009, as an increase in
notebook PC volume was offset by a decline in desktop PCs, workstations, and handheld devices. The unit volume increase in notebook PCs was due in part to growth of the HP and Compaq mini notebooks.
In fiscal 2009, net revenue for notebook PCs decreased 11%, while net revenue for desktop PCs decreased 23%. Workstations and handheld revenues declined 33% and 52%, respectively, in fiscal 2009. In
fiscal 2009, net revenue for consumer clients decreased 14%, while net revenue for commercial clients decreased 19%. The net revenue increase in Other PSG was related primarily to increased sales of
extended warranties, support services and third-party branded options. In fiscal 2009, PSG net revenue was also impacted by ASP declines. ASPs in consumer clients declined 21%, while ASPs in
commercial clients declined 16%. ASPs declined due primarily to a competitive pricing environment, component cost reductions and the impact of currency combined with a mix shift toward
lower-end models. The ASP decline in fiscal 2009 was offset slightly by an increase in the option and monitor attach rates.

PSG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.9 percentage points in fiscal 2009. The decrease was due primarily to a gross margin decline resulting
from ASPs declining at a faster pace than component costs combined with a mix shift toward lower-end products, the effects of which were partially offset by lower warranty and supply chain
costs and improvements in the option attach rate. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2009 was the result of effective cost controls.

net revenue increased 7.3% (8.4% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2010, reflecting a continued improvement in market conditions. Net revenue for commercial hardware increased
17% in fiscal 2010, due primarily to unit volume growth of 19% driven by improved product availability. Supplies net revenue increased 4% in fiscal 2010, due primarily to increased printing, which
resulted in stronger supply usage. Net revenue for consumer hardware increased 9% in fiscal 2010, driven primarily by unit volume growth of 11%.

IPG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.9 percentage points in fiscal 2010, due primarily to a decline in gross margin and increases in
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin decline in fiscal 2010 was due primarily to a higher mix of hardware and a correspondingly lower mix of supplies, the effect of
which was partially offset by cost savings associated with our ongoing efforts to optimize our supply chain. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2010 was due
primarily to increased marketing activities, the effect of which was partially offset by reduced administrative expenses.

IPG
net revenue decreased 18.9% (16.5% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2009, reflecting the impact of the global economic slowdown. Net revenue for commercial hardware declined 36%
in fiscal 2009. The net revenue decline in commercial hardware was driven by a unit volume decline of 38% in fiscal 2009, due primarily to worldwide market weaknesses impacting both our laser and our
graphics businesses. Supplies net revenue declined 11% in fiscal 2009. The supplies net revenue decline in fiscal 2009 was across all platforms and was the result of reductions in channel inventory
and unfavorable currency impacts, the effect of which was partially moderated by supplies pricing. Net revenue for
consumer hardware declined 27% in fiscal 2009. The net revenue decline in consumer hardware was driven by a unit volume decline of 24% in fiscal 2009, reflecting the weak demand environment and
channel inventory reductions.

IPG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 2.6 percentage points in fiscal 2009. Operating margin improvement in fiscal 2009 was a combination of an
increase in gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The improvement in gross margin in fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from an increase in the supplies mix and
supplies pricing, the effect of which was partially offset by hardware margin declines due to unfavorable currency impacts and declines in average revenue per unit. The decrease in operating expenses
as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to effective cost controls.

Net
revenue in Corporate Investments relates primarily to network infrastructure products sold under the "ProCurve Networking," "3Com" and "TippingPoint" brands. In fiscal 2010, revenue
from ProCurve Networking increased 33.9%, driven by improved market demand and continued investment in sales coverage. The revenue increase in Corporate Investments was also due to revenues resulting
from the acquisitions of 3Com and Palm, which HP completed in April 2010 and July 2010, respectively.

Corporate
Investments reported positive earnings from operations in fiscal 2010 due primarily to higher earnings from operations generated by network infrastructure products. Gross
margin rate in Corporate Investments for fiscal 2010 increased primarily as a result of the impact from the 3Com acquisition along with lower product costs in the sale of network infrastructure
products. The earnings from operations in Corporate Investments were also impacted by expenses carried in the segment associated with corporate development, global alliances and HP Labs; such expenses
declined from fiscal 2009.

In
fiscal 2009, net revenue in Corporate Investments related primarily to network infrastructure products sold under the brand "ProCurve Networking." Revenue from network infrastructure
products
decreased 19.6%, resulting from the slowdown in the networking market and a resulting decrease in sales of enterprise ethernet switch products. Partially offsetting the revenue decline was revenue
resulting from the acquisition of Colubris Networks, Inc. ("Colubris"), which HP acquired in October 2008.

Corporate
Investments reported a loss from operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to the positive earnings from operations reported in fiscal 2008 due primarily to lower earnings from
operations generated by network infrastructure products. Gross margin in Corporate Investments declined for fiscal 2009 as the result of a unit volume decline in the sale of network infrastructure
products and competitive pricing pressure. The loss from operations in Corporate Investments was also impacted by expenses carried in the segment associated with corporate development, global
alliances and HP Labs, which declined from fiscal 2008.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the United States.
Most of the amounts held outside of the United States could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, would be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign
tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. We have provided for the United States federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes, except
for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Repatriation could result in additional United States federal income tax payments in future years. Where
local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds,



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

our
intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the United States and we would meet United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We utilize a
variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.

LIQUIDITY

We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity; we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally
sufficient to support business operations, capital expenditures and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to a level of discretionary investments and share repurchases. We are able to
supplement this near-term liquidity,
if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities made available by various foreign and domestic financial institutions. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including
the market risks identified in the section entitled "Qualitative and Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in Item 7A.

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $1.5 billion for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009.
The decrease was due primarily to an increase in accounts and financing receivables resulting from higher revenues in the fourth quarter and higher payments for account payable activities, the impact
of which was partially offset by the increase in net earnings. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $1.2 billion for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. The
decrease was due primarily to increased utilization of cash resources for payment of operating liabilities such as accounts payable, other current liabilities and restructuring along with a decrease
in net earnings, the impact of which was partially offset by the increased generation of cash resources through the utilization of operating assets such as inventory and other current assets along
with increased amortization expense.

Cash conversion cycle




Days
of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable,
net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average net revenue. Our accounts receivable balance was $18.5 billion as of October 31, 2010.

Days
of supply in inventory ("DOS") measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day
average cost of goods sold. Our inventory balance was $6.5 billion as of October 31, 2010.

Days
of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("DPO") measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts
payable by a
90-day average cost of goods sold. Our accounts payable balance was $14.4 billion as of October 31, 2010.

Our
working capital requirements depend upon our effective management of the cash conversion cycle, which represents effectively the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for
the purchase of raw materials to the collection of cash from our customers. The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO.

The
cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2010 increased by 7 days as compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in DSO was due primarily to linearity and fewer cash discounts in the fourth
quarter. DOS remained flat year over year. The decrease in DPO was due primarily to a change in purchasing linearity in the fourth quarter.

The
cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2009 decreased by 6 days as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in DSO was due primarily to our improving penetration into the enterprise
market which tends to have a higher DSO profile, optimizing terms to drive shareholder value as well as more sales in the month of October. The decrease in DOS was due to lower inventory levels driven
primarily by



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

improved
inventory management. The increase in DPO was due primarily to a change in purchasing linearity as business recovered through the fourth quarter.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately $7.8 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009 due
primarily to higher cash payments made in connection with fiscal 2010 acquisitions and decreased by approximately $10.1 billion for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due primarily to
higher cash payments made in connection with fiscal 2008 acquisitions.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $3.8 billion for fiscal 2010, as compared to fiscal 2009. The
decrease was due primarily to a higher net
issuance of commercial paper, the impact of which was partially offset by increased repurchases of our common stock and lower global debt issuance. Net cash used in financing activities increased by
approximately $4.7 billion for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase was due primarily to higher net repayments of commercial paper and debt, the impact of which was partially
offset by decreased repurchases of our common stock.

Short-term
debt and long-term debt increased by $5.2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, for fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009. The net
increase in total debt is due primarily to spending on acquisitions and share repurchases. In fiscal 2009, short-term debt decreased by $8.3 billion and long-term debt
increased by $6.3 billion as compared to fiscal 2008. This was primarily due to the replacement of short-term debt with long-term debt as capital market conditions
improved from the prior year, the impact of which was partially offset by a reclassification of $1 billion from long-term to short-term.

Our
debt-equity ratio is calculated as the carrying value of debt divided by the carrying value of equity. Our debt-equity ratio increased by 0.16x in fiscal
2010, due primarily to the issuance of $3.0 billion of U.S Dollar Global Notes in September and a $4 billion net increase in commercial paper

at
the end of fiscal 2010. Our debt-equity ratio decreased by 0.07x in fiscal 2009 due primarily to the net repayment of $2.0 billion in debt.

Our
weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the year; it factors in the impact of swapping some of our global notes with
fixed interest rates for global notes with floating interest rates. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which
is incorporated herein by reference. The lower weighted-average interest rates over the past three years is a result of the combination of lower market interest rates and swapping some of our fixed
interest obligations associated with some of our fixed global notes for variable rate obligations through interest rate swaps in a declining rates environment.

For
more information on our borrowings, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

related principally to inventory and other items. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable without penalty. Purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine
arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. Even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the
terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business need prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

In
addition to the above, at October 31, 2010, we had approximately $2.0 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertainty in
income tax positions, which will be partially offset by $90 million of deferred tax assets and interest receivable. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include
$55 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the
uncertainties related to these tax matters. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional information on
taxes.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Funding Commitments

In fiscal 2011, we expect to contribute approximately $817 million to our pension and post-retirement plan funding.
Our funding policy is to contribute cash to our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding and taxing authorities.
Funding for the years following 2011 would be based on the then current market conditions, actuarial estimates and plan funding status. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional information on pension activity.

As
a result of our approved restructuring plans, we expect future cash expenditures of approximately $2.1 billion. We expect to make cash payments of approximately
$1.4 billion in fiscal 2011 with remaining cash payments through 2016. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference,
for additional information on restructuring activities.

Guarantees and Indemnifications

See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional
information on liabilities that may arise from guarantees and indemnifications.

Litigation and Contingencies

See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional
information on liabilities that may arise from litigation and contingencies.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities ("SPEs"), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of October 31, 2010, we are not involved in any material unconsolidated SPEs.



ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and equity price risks that could
impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use
derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of HP. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity
analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below.

Actual
gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and
equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and
assets, liabilities and debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currency to our
operations for fiscal 2010 were the euro, the Japanese yen, Chinese yuan renminbi and the British pound. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a
weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense
figures taken alone. We use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net
revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales and inter-company lease loan denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may
use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use
other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. For these types of derivatives and hedges we
recognize the gains and losses on these foreign currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency-denominated exposures.
Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other
offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2010 and 2009, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset
by the underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2010 and 2009. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a
hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of $122 million and $106 million at October 31, 2010 and
October 31, 2009, respectively.

Interest rate risk

We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables. We issue
long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. We then typically use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the
market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest



expense.
The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a
previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. In order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may
enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. We may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based interest income received on
certain variable-rate investments. We may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2010 and 2009, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investment instruments, financing receivables and
interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual maturities for the debt, investments and interest rate swaps and approximate maturities for financing receivables. The discount rates we used were based on
the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2010 and 2009. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the
fair values of our debt, investment instruments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swap positions, of $28 million at October 31, 2010 and $33 million at
October 31, 2009.

Equity price risk

We are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which had an estimated fair
value of $9 million at October 31, 2010 and $5 million at October 31, 2009. We monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis. Generally, we do not
attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities. However, we may use derivative transactions to hedge certain positions from time to time. We do not purchase our equity
securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes. A hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly traded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair
values of our marketable equity securities of approximately $3 million and $1 million at October 31,
2010 and 2009, respectively. The aggregate cost of privately-held companies, and other investments was $163 million at October 31, 2010 and $142 million at
October 31, 2009.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett-Packard Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2010
and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2010. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries at
October 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year 2010, Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries changed their method of accounting for business
combinations with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 805,

Business Combinations

,
and their method of accounting for noncontrolling interests with the adoption of the amendments to FASB ASC 810,

Consolidation

, both effective
November 1, 2009. In fiscal year 2009, Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries changed their method of accounting for revenue recognition with the adoption of amendments to the FASB ASC
resulting from Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13,

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements

, and Accounting Standards Update
No. 2009-14,

Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements

, both adopted effective November 1, 2008 and their
method of accounting for the measurement date provisions for their defined benefit postretirement plans in accordance with the guidance provided in FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension
and Other Postretirement Plans—An Amendment of FASB No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

(codified primarily in FASB ASC Topic 715,

Compensation—Retirement Benefits

).

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hewlett-Packard Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of October 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control

-

Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 15, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett-Packard Company

We have audited Hewlett-Packard Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2010, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hewlett-Packard Company's
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the
accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our
audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Hewlett-Packard Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2010, based on the COSO
criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard
Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 2010, and our report dated December 15, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

HP's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for HP. HP's
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. HP's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of HP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of HP are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of HP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of HP's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

HP's
management assessed the effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2010, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on the assessment by HP's management, we determined that HP's internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of October 31, 2010. The effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2010 has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, HP's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 71 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Hewlett-Packard Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its controlled
majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "HP"). HP accounts for equity investments in companies over which HP has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not hold a controlling
interest, under the equity method, and HP records its proportionate share of income or losses in interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. HP has eliminated all significant
intercompany accounts and transactions.

Reclassifications and Segment Reorganization

HP has made certain organizational realignments in order to optimize its operating structure. Reclassifications of prior year financial
information have been made to conform to the current year presentation. None of the changes impacts HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net
earnings per share. See Note 19 for a further discussion of HP's segment reorganization.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in HP's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Net revenue is derived primarily from the sale of products and services. The following revenue recognition policies define the manner
in which HP accounts for sales transactions.

HP
recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, HP recognizes hardware revenue on sales to channel partners, including resellers, distributors or value-added solution providers at the time of sale
when the channel partners have economic substance apart from HP and HP has completed its obligations related to the sale.

HP's
current revenue recognition policies, which were applied in fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, provide that, when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and
software products, licenses and/or services, HP allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective
evidence ("VSOE") if available, third party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In multiple element arrangements where
more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is
allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the
deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the
software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue, as amended.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

HP
limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations or
subject to customer-specified return or refund privileges.

HP
evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has
standalone value and there are no customer-negotiated refund or return rights for the delivered elements. If the arrangement includes a customer-negotiated refund or return right relative to the
delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in HP's control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In
instances when the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and the allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition is
determined for the combined unit as a single unit. Allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit's relative selling price.

HP
establishes VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant
authority. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. The best estimate
of selling price is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is
also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles.

For
fiscal 2008, pursuant to the previous guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2009-13,
"Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements," for a sales arrangement with multiple elements, HP allocated revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, or for software, based on VSOE of
fair value. In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, HP first allocated revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. Where the
fair value for an undelivered element could not be determined, HP deferred revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements were delivered or the fair value was determinable for the
remaining undelivered elements. If the revenue for a delivered item was not recognized because it was not separable from the
undelivered item, then HP also deferred the cost of the delivered item. HP limited the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that was not contingent on the future delivery
of products or services, future performance obligations or subject to customer-specified return or refund privileges. For the purposes of income statement classification of products and services
revenue, when HP could not determine fair value for all of the elements in an arrangement and the transaction was accounted for as a single unit of accounting, HP allocated revenue to products and
services based on a rational and consistent methodology. This methodology utilized external and internal pricing inputs to derive HP's best estimate of fair value for the elements in the arrangement.

In
instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor services, revenue is recorded at gross when HP is a principal to the transaction and net of costs when HP is acting
as an agent between the customer and the vendor. Several factors are considered to determine whether HP is an agent or principal, most notably whether HP is the primary obligor to the customer, has
established its own pricing, and has inventory and credit risks.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

HP
reports revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to
the relevant government authority.

Products

Hardware

Under
HP's standard terms and conditions of sale, HP transfers title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is delivered to the customer and
revenue is recognized accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain. HP reduces revenue for estimated customer returns, price protection, rebates and other
programs offered under sales agreements established by HP with its distributors and resellers. HP records revenue from the sale of equipment under sales-type leases as product revenue at
the inception of the lease.
HP accrues the estimated cost of post-sale obligations, including basic product warranties, based on historical experience at the time HP recognizes revenue.

Software

In
accordance with the specific guidance for recognizing software revenue, where applicable, HP recognizes revenue from perpetual software licenses at the
inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Term-based software license revenue is recognized on a subscription basis over the term of the
license entitlement. HP uses the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at the inception of the license term when VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements exists, such as
post-contract support, and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue generated from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates on a
when-and-if-available basis is recognized over the period such items are delivered.

Services

HP
recognizes revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software post-contract customer
support agreements, ratably over the contract period and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred. For time and material contracts, HP recognizes revenue and costs as services
are rendered. HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price consulting arrangements over the contract period on a proportional performance basis, as determined by the relationship of actual labor costs
incurred to date to the estimated total contract labor costs, with estimates regularly revised during the life of the contract. HP recognizes revenue on certain design and build (design, development
and/or construction of software and/or systems) projects using the percentage-of-completion method. HP uses the cost to cost method of measurement towards completion as
determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project. HP uses the completed contract method if reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot
be made.

Outsourcing
services revenue is generally recognized when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent upon any future event. If the service is provided evenly during
the contract term but service billings are uneven, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. HP recognizes revenue from operating leases on a
straight-line basis as service revenue over the rental period.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

HP
recognizes costs associated with outsourcing contracts as incurred, unless such costs relate to the transition phase of the outsourcing contract, in which case HP defers and
subsequently amortizes these set-up costs over the contractual services period. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining original term
unless billing patterns indicate a more accelerated method is appropriate. Based on actual and projected contract financial performance indicators, the recoverability of deferred contract costs
associated with a particular contract is analyzed on a periodic basis using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the whole contract over its remaining contract term. If such undiscounted cash
flows are insufficient to recover the long-lived assets and deferred contract costs, the deferred contract costs are written down based on a discounted cash flow model. If a cash flow
deficiency remains after reducing the balance of the deferred contract costs to zero, any remaining long-lived assets related to that contract are evaluated for impairment.

HP
recognizes losses on consulting and outsourcing arrangements in the period that the contractual loss becomes probable and estimable. HP records amounts invoiced to customers in excess
of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. HP records revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on fixed-price contracts as
trade receivables.

Financing Income

Sales-type and direct-financing leases produce financing income, which HP recognizes at consistent rates of return over the
lease term.

Deferred Revenue and Related Deferred Contract Costs

Deferred revenue represents amounts received in advance for product support contracts, software customer support contracts, outsourcing
start-up services work, consulting and integration projects, product sales or leasing income. The product support contracts include stand-alone product support packages, routine
maintenance service contracts, upgrades or extensions to standard product warranty, as well as high availability services for complex, global, networked, multi-vendor environments. HP defers these
service amounts at the time HP bills the customer, and HP then generally recognizes the amounts ratably over the support contract life or
as HP delivers the services. HP also defers and subsequently amortizes certain costs related to start-up activities that enable the performance of the customer's long-term
services contract. Deferred contract costs, including start-up and other unbilled costs, are generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the contract term unless specific
customer contract terms and conditions indicate a more accelerated method is more appropriate.

Shipping and Handling

HP includes costs related to shipping and handling in cost of sales for all periods presented.

Advertising

HP expenses advertising costs as incurred or when the advertising is first run. Such costs totaled approximately $1.0 billion in
fiscal 2010, $0.7 billion in fiscal 2009 and $1.0 billion in fiscal 2008.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant-date fair
value. HP recognizes these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate, and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the share-based payment awards. HP estimated the forfeiture rate based on its historical experience for fiscal grant years
where the majority of the vesting terms have been satisfied.

Foreign Currency Transactions

HP uses the U.S. dollar predominately as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars
are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, cost of sales and
expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each new reporting period, and net revenue, cost of sales and expenses related to the previously reported periods are remeasured at
historical exchange rates. HP includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in net earnings. Certain foreign subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and
HP records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet dates as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss).

Taxes on Earnings

HP recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. HP records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax
assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

HP classifies investments as cash equivalents if the original maturity of an investment is ninety days or less. Cash and cash
equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments in time deposits held in major banks and commercial paper. As of October 31, 2010 and 2009, the carrying value of cash and cash
equivalents approximates fair value due to the short period of time to maturity.

Investments

HP's investments consist principally of time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt, other debt securities, and
equity securities of publicly-traded and privately-held companies.

HP
classifies its investments in debt securities and its equity investments in public companies as available-for-sale securities and carries them at fair value.
HP determines fair values for investments in public companies using quoted market prices and records a charge to Interest and other, net when the change in fair values is determined to be an
other-than-temporary change. HP carries equity investments in privately-held companies at cost or at fair value when HP recognizes an
other-than-temporary impairment charge.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

HP
monitors its investment portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis. When the carrying value of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is
determined to be an other-than-temporary decline, and when HP does not intend to sell the debt securities and it is not more likely than not that HP will be required to sell
the debt securities prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, HP records an impairment charge to Interest and other, net in the amount of the credit loss and the balance, if any, to other
comprehensive income (loss).

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject HP to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents, investments, accounts receivable from trade customers and from contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.

HP
maintains cash and cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These
financial institutions are located in many different geographical regions, and HP's policy is designed to limit exposure with any one institution. As part of its cash and risk management processes, HP
performs periodic
evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions. HP has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. HP utilizes forward contracts
and other derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result
in a material loss.

HP
sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant receivable balances with these parties.
If the financial condition or operations of all of these distributors' and resellers' aggregated accounts deteriorate substantially, HP's operating results could be adversely affected. The ten largest
distributor and reseller receivable balances collectively, which were concentrated primarily in North America and Europe, represented approximately 18% of gross accounts receivable at
October 31, 2010 and 22% at October 31, 2009. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable and financing
receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising HP's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographical regions. HP performs
ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its third-party distributors, resellers and other customers and requires collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain
circumstances. To ensure a receivable balance is not overstated due to uncollectibility, an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained as required under U.S. GAAP. The past due or
delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable. The need to write off a receivable balance depends on the age, size and a determination of
collectability of the receivable. HP generally has experienced longer accounts receivable collection cycles in its emerging markets, in particular Asia Pacific and Latin America, compared to its
markets in the United States and Europe. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles in emerging markets significantly deteriorate or one or more of HP's larger resellers or enterprise
customers fails, HP's operating results could be adversely affected.

Other Concentration

HP obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality or other
considerations. The loss of a single source supplier, the deterioration



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

of
its relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which HP is supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect HP's
revenue and gross margins.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

HP establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade and financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability.
HP maintains bad debt reserves based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, trends in overall weighted-average risk rating of the total portfolio,
macroeconomic conditions, significant one-time events, historical experience and the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities
based on market factors and the financial condition of customers. HP records a specific reserve for individual accounts when HP becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of
bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to the specific customer change, HP would further adjust estimates of the
recoverability of receivables.

Inventory

HP values inventory at the lower of cost or market, with cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis.
Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances.

Property, Plant and Equipment

HP states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. HP capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses
maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation is computed using straight-line or accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are 5 to
40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment. HP depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is
shorter. HP depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. The estimated useful lives of assets used solely to support a customer
services contract generally do not exceed the term of the customer contract.

HP
capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and
installation and testing of the software. HP amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally
from three to five years.

Software Development Costs

Costs incurred to acquire or develop software for resale may be capitalized subsequent to the software product establishing
technological feasibility. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the greater of the straight-line amortization method or the ratio that current gross revenues for a
product bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product. The estimated useful lives for capitalized software for resale are generally three years or less. Software
development costs incurred subsequent to a product establishing technological feasibility are usually not significant. In those instances, such costs are expensed as incurred.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Business Combinations

HP has adopted the new accounting standard related to business combinations. HP has included the results of operations of the
businesses that it acquired in fiscal 2010 in HP's consolidated results as of the respective dates of acquisition. HP allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to the tangible assets,
liabilities and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is
recorded as goodwill. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is
reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, HP will record a charge for the value of the related
intangible asset to HP's Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period it is abandoned. Acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination
and are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least
annually. HP reviews goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually at the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For goodwill, HP performs a two-step impairment test. In the first step, HP compares the fair value of each
reporting unit to its carrying value. In general, HP's reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 19. However, for certain businesses within the Corporate
Investments segment, the reporting unit is one step below the segment level. HP determines the fair value of its reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income
approach, HP calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, HP estimates the fair value based on market multiples
of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further
testing is performed. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then HP must perform the second step of the impairment test
in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, HP records an impairment loss equal
to the difference.

HP
estimates the fair value of indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets using an income approach. HP recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the
indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets is less than the carrying value.

HP
amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from one to ten years.

Long-Lived Asset Impairment

HP evaluates property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. HP assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flow and recognizes an impairment
loss when the estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

result
from the use of the asset plus the net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When HP identifies an impairment, HP reduces the
carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

HP measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Financial instruments are
primarily comprised of time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate and other debt securities, equity securities and other investments in common stock and common stock equivalents
and derivatives. See Note 9 for a further discussion on fair value of financial instruments.

Derivative Financial Instruments

HP uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and options, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate
exposures. HP also may use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges such as forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. HP does not use derivative, financial
instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 10 for a full description of HP's derivative financial instrument activities and related accounting policies.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans

HP has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory retirement and post-retirement plans. In addition,
HP has assumed additional retirement and post-retirement plans in connection with its acquisition of Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") in August 2008. HP generally
amortizes unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service life of participants. The measurement date for all HP plans is
October 31 for fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009. See Note 10 for a full description of these plans and the accounting and funding policies.

Loss Contingencies

HP is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP records a
provision for a liability when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both
probability and the estimated amount. HP reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel,
and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond HP's control.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Accounting Pronouncements

In December 2007, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to non-controlling interests. The standard establishes
accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the
non-controlling interests, changes in a parent's ownership interest, and the valuation of retained non-controlling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. The standard also establishes
disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non-controlling owners. In January 2010, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2010-02, "Consolidation: Accounting and Reporting for Decreases in Ownership of a Subsidiary—a Scope Clarification." This update clarifies the scope
of the decrease in ownership provisions and also requires expanded disclosures. HP adopted these standards in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 with retrospective application of the presentation and
disclosure requirements. Non-controlling interests of $247 million at October 31, 2009 were reclassified from Other liabilities to Stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Condensed
Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2009. Elimination of the income attributable to non-controlling interests, recorded in Interest and other, net, was not material for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and
2008 and is disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity.

Note 2: Stock-Based Compensation

HP's stock-based compensation plans include incentive compensation plans and an employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP").

Stock-based Compensation Expense and the Related Income Tax Benefits

Total stock-based compensation expense before income taxes for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $668 million, $635 million
and $606 million, respectively. The resulting income tax benefit for fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $216 million, $199 million and $178 million, respectively.

Cash
received from option exercises and purchases under the ESPP was $2.6 billion in fiscal 2010 and $1.8 billion for both fiscal 2009 and 2008. The actual tax benefit
realized for the tax deduction from option exercises of the share-based payment awards in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $414 million, $252 million and $412 million, respectively.

Incentive Compensation Plans

HP's incentive compensation plans include principal equity plans adopted in 2004 (as amended in 2010), 2000, 1995 and 1990 ("principal
equity plans"), as well as various equity plans assumed through acquisitions under which stock-based awards are outstanding. Stock-based awards granted from the principal equity plans include
performance-based restricted units ("PRUs"), stock options and restricted stock awards. Employees meeting certain employment qualifications are eligible to receive stock-based awards.

In
fiscal 2008, HP implemented a program that provides for the issuance of PRUs representing hypothetical shares of HP common stock. PRU awards may be granted to eligible employees,
including HP's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other executive officers. Each PRU award reflects a target number of shares ("Target Shares") that may be issued to the
award recipient



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 2: Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

before
adjusting for performance and market conditions. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end of a three-year performance period based on results
achieved versus company performance goals. Those goals are based on HP's annual cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue and total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to the S&P 500
over the three-year performance period. Depending on the results achieved during the three-year performance period, the actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives
at the end of the period may range from 0% to 200% of the Target Shares granted, based on the calculations described below.

Cash
flow performance goals are established at the beginning of each year. At the end of each year, a portion of the Target Shares may be credited in the award recipient's name depending
on the achievement of the cash flow performance goal for that year. The number of shares credited varies between 0% if performance is below the minimum level and 150% if performance is at or above the
maximum level. For performance between the minimum level and the maximum level, a proportionate percentage between 30% and 150% is applied based on relative performance between the minimum and the
maximum levels.

Following
the expiration of the three-year performance period, the number of shares credited to the award recipient during the performance period is adjusted by a TSR
modifier. The TSR modifier varies between 0%, if the minimum level is not met, resulting in no payout under the PRU award, and 133%, if performance is at or above the maximum level. For performance
between the minimum level and the maximum level, a proportionate TSR modifier between 66% and 133% is applied based on relative performance between the minimum and the maximum levels. The number of
shares, if any, received by the PRU award recipient equals the number of shares credited to the award recipient during the performance period multiplied by the TSR modifier.

Recipients
of PRU awards generally must remain employed by HP on a continuous basis through the end of the applicable three-year performance period in order to receive any
portion of the shares subject to that award. Target Shares subject to PRU awards do not have dividend equivalent rights and do not have the voting rights of common stock until earned and issued
following the end of the applicable performance period. The expense for these awards, net of estimated forfeitures, is recorded over the requisite service period based on the number of target shares
that are expected to be earned and the achievement of the cash flow goals during the performance period.

Stock
options granted under the principal equity plans are generally non-qualified stock options, but the principal equity plans permit some options granted to qualify as
"incentive stock options" under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Stock options generally vest over four years from the date of grant. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the fair market
value of HP's common stock on the option grant date (as determined by the reported sale prices of HP's common stock when the market closes on that date). The contractual term of options granted since
fiscal 2003 was generally eight years, while the contractual term of options granted prior to fiscal 2003 was generally ten years. Prior to March 2010, HP could choose, in certain cases, to establish
a discounted exercise price at no less than 75% of fair market value on the grant date. HP has not granted any discounted options since fiscal 2003.

Under
the principal equity plans, HP granted certain employees cash-settled awards, restricted stock awards, or both. Restricted stock awards are non-vested stock
awards that may include grants of restricted stock or grants of restricted stock units. Cash-settled awards and restricted stock awards are independent of option grants and are generally
subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to

the
release of the restrictions. Such awards generally vest one to three years from the date of grant. During that period, ownership of the shares cannot be transferred. Restricted stock has the same
cash dividend and voting rights as other common stock and is considered to be currently issued and outstanding. Restricted stock units have dividend equivalent rights equal to the cash dividend paid
on restricted stock. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying the restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding. However,
shares underlying restricted stock units are included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share ("EPS"). HP expenses the fair market value of restricted stock awards, as determined on the date
of grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.

Performance-based Restricted Units

HP estimates the fair value of a target PRU share using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as the TSR modifier contains a market
condition. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the weighted-average fair values of the PRU awards for fiscal years ended October 31:

applicable to PRUs granted in fiscal 2010. The estimated fair value of a target share for the third year for PRUs granted in fiscal 2009 and for the second and third years for PRUs granted in fiscal

expects to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.2 years. At October 31, 2009, there was $193 million of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based
compensation expense related to PRUs with an assigned fair value, which HP expected to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.5 years.

Stock Options

HP utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the stock options granted under its principal equity plans. HP examined its
historical pattern of option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations. From this analysis, HP identified three employee
populations on which to apply the Black-Scholes model. The table below presents the weighted-average expected life in months of the combined three identified employee populations. The expected life
computation is based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior within each of the three populations identified. The risk-free interest rate for
periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that option holders would have received had all option holders exercised their
options on October 31, 2010 and 2009. The aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between HP's closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009 and the exercise
price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. Total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $1.3 billion, $0.8 billion
and $1.1 billion, respectively. Total grant date fair value of options vested and expensed in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $93 million, $172 million and $264 million,
respectively, net of taxes.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

HP sponsors the Hewlett-Packard Company 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"), also known as the Share Ownership Plan,
pursuant to which eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of base compensation, subject to certain income limits, to purchase shares of HP's common stock. The ESPP expired in November 2010.

For
purchases made on or before April 30, 2009, employees purchased stock pursuant to the ESPP semi-annually at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value on the
purchase date, and HP recognized expense based on a 15% discount of the fair market value for those purchases. Effective May 1, 2009, HP modified the ESPP to eliminate the 15% discount
applicable to purchases made under the ESPP.

earnings available to participating securities were not significant for fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008. HP considers restricted stock
that provides the holder with a non-forfeitable right to receive dividends to be a participating security.

HP
excludes options with exercise prices that are greater than the average market price from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would be anti-dilutive. In
fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, HP excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS options to purchase 5 million shares, 85 million shares and 54 million shares, respectively. HP
also excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS options to purchase an additional 2 million shares, 2 million shares and 28 million shares in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively, whose combined exercise price, unamortized fair value
and excess tax benefits were greater in each of those periods than the average market price for HP's common stock because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

In
October and November 1997, HP issued U.S. dollar zero-coupon subordinated convertible notes due 2017 (the "LYONs"), the outstanding principal amount of which was
redeemed in March 2008. The LYONs were convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. For purposes of calculating
diluted earnings per share above, the interest expense (net of tax) associated with the LYONs was added back to net earnings, and the shares issuable upon conversion of the LYONs were included in the
weighted-average shares used to compute diluted earnings per share for periods that the LYONs were outstanding.

Note 6: Acquisitions

Acquisitions in fiscal 2010

In fiscal 2010, HP completed eleven acquisitions. The purchase price allocation for these acquisitions as set forth in the table below
reflects various preliminary fair value estimates and analyses, including preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists, which are subject to change within the measurement period as
valuations are finalized. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, the
valuation of intangible assets acquired, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes, and residual goodwill. We expect to continue to obtain information to assist us in
determining the fair value of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period. Measurement period adjustments that HP determines to be material will be applied
retrospectively to the period of acquisition in HP's consolidated financial statements and, depending on the nature of the adjustments, other periods subsequent to the period of acquisition could also
be affected.

Pro
forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to HP's consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the
aggregate. Goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, is not deductible for tax purposes.

acquisition, HP recorded approximately $1.2 billion of goodwill, amortizable purchased intangible assets of $393 million and IPR&D assets of $41 million. HP is amortizing the
purchased intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average life of 6.8 years.

Acquisitions in prior years

In fiscal 2009, HP completed two acquisitions. Total consideration for the acquisitions was $390 million, which includes direct
transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities in connection with the transactions. The largest of the two acquisitions was the acquisition of Lefthand Networks, Inc., a leading provider
of storage virtualization and solutions, which has been integrated into ESS, at a purchase price of $347 million. In fiscal 2009, HP recorded $315 million of goodwill, $105 million of purchased
intangibles and $7 million of IPR&D related to these transactions.

In
fiscal 2008, HP completed nine acquisitions and a minority interest purchase for a total consideration of $14.6 billion. The largest acquisition was the acquisition of EDS for
a purchase price of $13.0 billion. The purchase price comprised of $12.7 billion cash paid for outstanding common stock, $328 million for the fair value of stock options and
restricted stock units assumed, and $36 million for direct transaction costs. Of the total purchase price, $10.4 billion has been allocated to goodwill, $4.6 billion has been
allocated to amortizable intangible assets acquired and $2.0 billion has been allocated to net tangible liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition. HP also expensed $30 million for
IPR&D charges. HP included the results of EDS in its consolidated results of operations starting on August 26, 2008, the closing date of the acquisition.

During
fiscal 2010, HP recorded approximately $5.2 billion of goodwill related to acquisitions based on its preliminary purchase price allocations. In addition, HP recorded
goodwill adjustments primarily related to an increase to the deferred tax liability on outside basis differences of EDS foreign subsidiaries at acquisition. HP also recorded an increase to goodwill as
a result of currency translation related to 3Com's subsidiary whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. These increases to goodwill were partially offset by tax adjustments primarily related
to tax deductible stock-based awards for certain acquisitions for which the acquisition date preceded the effective date of the new accounting standard for business combinations.

During
fiscal 2009, HP recorded adjustments of approximately $306 million to the estimated fair values of EDS's intangible assets and net liabilities acquired resulting in an increase to
EDS's goodwill, which is allocated to the Services segment. These changes in the estimated fair values relate primarily to restructuring liabilities, fixed assets, net deferred tax liabilities and
intangible assets. In addition,

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 7: Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets (Continued)

goodwill
increased approximately $255 million as a result of currency translation related to certain of EDS's foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. These increases in
goodwill were partially offset by tax adjustments for various previous acquisitions.

Based
on the results of its annual impairment tests, HP determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of August 1, 2010 or August 1, 2009. However, future goodwill
impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. HP will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events and changes in
circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment.

For

For
fiscal 2009, HP recorded an increase of $83 million to purchased intangibles as a result of currency translation related to certain of EDS's foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar. HP also recorded an increase of $21 million to the estimated fair value of EDS's intangible assets acquired.

Based
on the results of its annual impairment tests, HP determined that no impairment of the indefinite-lived Compaq trade name existed as of August 1, 2010 or August 1,
2009. However, future impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. HP will continue to evaluate the Compaq trade
name on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an indicator of potential impairment.

The
finite-lived purchased intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer lists and distribution agreements, which have weighted-average useful lives of 8 years, and
developed and core technology, patents and product trademarks, which have weighted-average useful lives of 5 years.

Note 8: Restructuring Charges

HP records restructuring charges associated with management approved restructuring plans to either reorganize one or more of HP's business segments, or to remove duplicative headcount
and
infrastructure associated with one or more business acquisitions. Restructuring charges can include severance costs to eliminate a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate
facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation cost. Restructuring charges are recorded based upon planned employee termination dates and site closure and consolidation plans. The
timing of associated cash payments is dependent upon the type of restructuring charge and can extend over a multi-year period. HP records the short-term portion of the restructuring liability in
Accrued restructuring and the long-term portion in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Fiscal 2010 Acquisitions

On July 1, 2010, HP completed the acquisition of Palm. In connection with the acquisition, HP's management approved and
initiated a plan to restructure the operations of Palm, including severance for Palm employees, contract cancellation costs and other items. The total expected cost of the plan is $46 million.
In fiscal 2010, HP recorded restructuring charges of approximately $46 million. No further restructuring charges are anticipated, subject to changes in the Palm integration plan. The majority
of these costs are expected to be paid out by the second quarter of fiscal 2011.

On
April 12, 2010, HP completed the acquisition of 3Com. In connection with the acquisition, HP's management approved and initiated a plan to restructure the operation of 3Com,
including severance costs and costs to vacate duplicative facilities. The total expected cost of the plan is $42 million. In fiscal 2010, HP recorded restructuring charges of approximately
$18 million. HP expects to record the majority of the cost of this restructuring plan by the second quarter of fiscal 2011 based upon the timing of planned terminations and facility closure
dates. These costs are expected to be paid out through fiscal 2016.

Fiscal 2010 ES Restructuring Plan

On June 1, 2010, HP's management announced a plan to restructure its enterprise services business, which includes its
infrastructure technology outsourcing, business process outsourcing and application services business units. The multi-year restructuring program includes plans to consolidate commercial
data centers, tools and applications. The total expected cost of the plan that will be

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 8: Restructuring Charges (Continued)

recorded
as restructuring charges is approximately $1.0 billion, including severance costs to eliminate approximately 9,000 positions and infrastructure charges. For fiscal 2010, a
restructuring charge of $650 million was recorded primarily related to severance costs. HP expects to record the majority of the
remaining severance costs by the second quarter of fiscal 2011 and the majority of the infrastructure charges through fiscal 2012. The timing of the charges is based upon planned termination dates and
site closure and consolidation plans. The majority of the associated cash payments are expected to be paid out through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012. As of October 31, 2010, approximately
2,100 positions have been eliminated.

Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan

In May 2009, HP's management approved and initiated a restructuring plan to structurally change and improve the effectiveness of the
Imaging and Printing Group ("IPG"), the Personal Systems Group ("PSG"), and Enterprise Storage and Servers ("ESS") businesses. The total expected cost of the plan is $292 million in
severance-related costs associated with the planned elimination of approximately 5,000 positions. As of October 31, 2010, approximately 4,200 positions had been eliminated. HP expects the
remaining positions to be eliminated and a majority of the restructuring costs to be paid out through the first quarter of fiscal 2011.

Fiscal 2008 HP/EDS Restructuring Plan

In connection with the acquisition of EDS on August 26, 2008, HP's management approved and initiated a restructuring plan to
combine and align HP's services businesses, eliminate duplicative overhead functions and consolidate and vacate duplicative facilities. The restructuring plan is expected to be implemented over four
years from the acquisition date at a total expected cost of $3.4 billion.

The
restructuring plan includes severance cost to eliminate approximately 25,000 positions. As of October 31, 2010, the vast majority of the positions had been eliminated, and the
associated severance costs had been paid out. The infrastructure charges in the restructuring plan include facility closure and consolidation costs and the costs associated with early termination of
certain contractual obligations. HP expects to record the majority of these costs through fiscal 2011 based upon the execution of site closure and consolidation plans. The associated cash payments are
expected to be paid out through fiscal 2016.

Approximately
$1.5 billion of the expected costs were associated with pre-acquisition EDS and were reflected in the purchase price of EDS. These costs are subject to
change based on the actual costs incurred. The remaining costs are primarily associated with HP and will be recorded as a restructuring charge.

During fiscal 2010, HP had completed payouts of restructuring liabilities associated with previous restructuring actions and recorded a
restructuring charge in fiscal 2010 of $6 million associated with these actions. At October 31, 2009, HP had $51 million of restructuring liabilities associated with these
actions.

At
October 31, 2010 and October 31, 2009, HP included the long-term portion of the restructuring liability of $297 million and $356 million,
respectively, in Other liabilities, and the short-term portion in Accrued restructuring in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Note 9: Fair Value

HP
adopted the provisions related to the fair value of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for the following major categories of
nonfinancial items from the Consolidated Balance Sheet: Property, plant and equipment; Goodwill; Purchased intangible assets; Accrued restructuring; and the asset retirement obligations within Other
accrued liabilities and Other liabilities. The provisions of the accounting standard related to measuring fair value and related disclosures are applied to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities whenever they are required to be measured at fair value, such as when accounting for a business combination, when evaluating and/or determining impairment, or in accordance with certain
other accounting pronouncements. Except for assets and liabilities acquired in business combinations as discussed in Note 6, HP did not measure any material nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial
liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis in fiscal 2010.

Except
for the provisions noted above, the accounting standard relating to fair value measurements and disclosures became effective for HP beginning in fiscal 2009. This standard
establishes a new framework for measuring fair value and expands related disclosures. The framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset
or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 9: Fair Value (Continued)

Valuation
techniques used by HP are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable or market inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable
inputs reflect HP's assumptions about market participant assumptions based on best information available.
Observable inputs are the preferred source of values. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1—Quoted
prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets.

Level 2—Quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based
valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3—Prices
or valuations that require management inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

The
following section describes the valuation methodologies HP uses to measure its financial assets and liabilities at fair value.

Cash
Equivalents and Investments: HP holds time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, other debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and
bonds, and common stock and equivalents. Where applicable, HP uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
are not available to determine fair value, HP uses quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. If quoted prices for identical or
similar assets are not available, HP uses internally developed valuation models, whose inputs include bid prices, and third-party valuations utilizing underlying assets assumptions.

Derivative
Instruments: As discussed in Note 10, HP mainly holds non-speculative forwards, swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate
exposures. When active market quotes are not available, HP uses industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a
present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. In certain cases, market-based
observable inputs are not available and, in those cases, HP uses management judgment to develop assumptions which are used to determine fair value.

equivalents consist of investments in time deposits, commercial paper and money market funds with original maturities of ninety days or less. Interest income related to cash and
cash equivalents was approximately $111 million in fiscal 2010, $119 million in fiscal 2009 and $401 million in fiscal 2008. Time deposits were primarily issued by institutions
outside the U.S. as of October 31, 2010 and October 31, 2009. Available-for-sale securities consist of short-term investments which mature within
twelve months or less and long-term investments with maturities longer than twelve months. Investments include primarily time deposits, fixed-interest securities, and institutional bonds.
HP estimates the fair values of its investments based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. These estimated fair values may not be representative of actual values that
will be realized in the future.

The
gross unrealized loss as of October 31, 2010 was due primarily to declines in the fair value of certain debt securities and included $28 million that has been in a
continuous loss position for more than twelve months. The gross unrealized loss as of October 31, 2009 was due primarily to declines in the fair value of certain debt securities and included
$20 million that had been in a continuous loss

position
for more than twelve months. HP does not intend to sell these debt securities, and it is not likely that HP will be required to sell these debt securities prior to the recovery of the
amortized cost.

HP
determined the declines in value of certain investments to be other-than-temporary declines. Accordingly, HP recorded impairments relating to credit losses of approximately
$12 million in fiscal 2010, $24 million in fiscal 2009 and $27 million in fiscal 2008. HP includes these impairments in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. Depending on market and other conditions, HP may record additional impairments with respect to its investment portfolio in the future.

offset
changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. HP includes gains or losses from changes in fair value of these securities, offset by losses or gains on the
related liabilities, in Interest and other, net, in HP's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The net losses associated with these securities were $7 million and $14 million in fiscal
years 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Derivative Financial Instruments

HP is a global company that is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of
its business. As part of its risk management strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, option contracts, interest rate swaps, and total return swaps, to hedge certain
foreign currency, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. HP's objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts
used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting fair values of assets and liabilities. HP does not have any leveraged derivatives and does not use derivative contracts for
speculative purposes. HP designates its derivatives as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation ("net investment
hedges"). Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, HP categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. HP recognizes all derivatives, on a gross basis, in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and reports them in Other current assets, Long-term financing receivables and other assets, Other accrued liabilities, or Other liabilities. HP
classifies cash flows from the derivative programs as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

As
a result of the use of derivative instruments, HP is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the
counterparty credit risk, HP has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors, and HP maintains
dollar and term limits that correspond to each institution's credit rating. HP's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions and short-term
cash include reviewing and
establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. Master agreements with counterparties include master netting arrangements as further
mitigation of credit exposure to counterparties. These arrangements permit HP to net amounts due from HP to a counterparty with amounts due to HP from a counterparty, which reduces the maximum loss
from credit risk in the event of counterparty default.

Certain
of HP's derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as a provision whereby HP and the counterparties to the derivative
instruments could request collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions if HP's or the counterparties' credit rating falls below certain thresholds. As of October 31,
2010 and October 31, 2009, HP was not required to post any collateral, and HP did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that
were in a significant net liability position.

Fair Value Hedges

HP enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to interest rate risk. HP issues long-term
debt in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. HP uses



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 10: Financial Instruments (Continued)

interest
rate swaps to mitigate the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve
principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, HP may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it
believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. When investing in fixed-rate instruments, HP may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed
interest returns into variable interest returns and would classify these swaps as fair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, HP recognizes the
gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the current period.

Cash Flow Hedges

HP uses a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange
rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expense, and intercompany lease loan
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. HP's foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within six to twelve months. However, certain leasing revenue-related forward contracts
and intercompany lease loan forward contracts extend for the duration of the lease term, which can be up to five years. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges,
HP initially records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of stockholders' equity and
subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. HP reports the effective portion of cash flow hedges in the same
financial statement line item as the changes in value of the hedged item. During fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, HP did not discontinue any cash flow hedge for which it was probable that a
forecasted transaction would not occur.

Net Investment Hedges

HP uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is the local currency. These derivative instruments are designated as net investment hedges and, as such, HP records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument
together with changes in the hedged items in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of stockholders' equity.

Other Derivatives

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts HP uses to hedge foreign currency
balance sheet exposures. HP also uses total return swaps and, to a lesser extent, interest rate swaps, based on the equity and fixed income indices, to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan
liability. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, HP recognizes changes in the fair values in earnings in the period of change. HP recognizes the gain or loss on foreign
currency forward contracts used to hedge balance sheet exposures in Interest and other, net in the same period as the remeasurement gain and loss of the related foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities. HP recognizes the gain or loss on the total return swaps and interest rate swaps in Interest and other, net in the same period as the gain or loss from the change in market value of the
executive deferred compensation plan liability.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 10: Financial Instruments (Continued)

Hedge Effectiveness

For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged
debt with the change in fair value of the derivative. For foreign currency options and forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, HP measures effectiveness by comparing the
cumulative change in the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. HP recognizes any ineffective portion of the hedge, as well as amounts
not included in the assessment of effectiveness, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of October 31, 2010 and October 31, 2009, the portion of hedging instruments' gain or loss
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness was not material for fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Hedge ineffectiveness for fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges was not
material in fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets

As discussed in Note 9, HP estimates the fair values of derivatives primarily based on pricing models using current market rates
and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The gross notional and fair value of derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were recorded as follows:

Other Financial Instruments

For the balance of HP's financial instruments, accounts receivable, financing receivables, notes payable and short-term
borrowings, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The estimated fair value of HP's short- and long-term
debt was approximately $22.5 billion at October 31, 2010, compared to a carrying value of $22.3 billion at that date. The estimated fair value of HP's short- and
long-term debt was approximately $16.0 billion at October 31, 2009, compared to a carrying value of $15.8 billion at that date. The estimated fair value of the debt is
based primarily on quoted market prices, as well as borrowing rates currently available to HP for bank loans with similar terms and maturities.

Note 11: Financing Receivables and Operating Leases

Financing receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases resulting from the placement of HP's and third-party products. These receivables typically have terms
from two to five years and are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from operating leases. The components of
net financing receivables, which are

Note 12: Guarantees

Guarantees and Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, HP may provide certain clients with subsidiary performance guarantees and/or financial performance
guarantees, which may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, HP would be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event that the nonperformance of HP or HP's
subsidiaries permits termination of the related contract by the client, the likelihood of which HP believes is remote. HP believes that the company is in compliance with the performance obligations
under all material service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee.

HP
has certain service contracts supported by client financing or securitization arrangements. Under specific circumstances involving nonperformance resulting in service contract
termination or failure to comply with terms under the financing arrangement, HP would be required to acquire certain assets. HP considers the possibility of its failure to comply to be remote and the
asset amounts involved to be immaterial.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 12: Guarantees (Continued)

In
the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to
the services they perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past
performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.

Warranty

HP provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. HP engages in extensive product quality
programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, product warranty terms offered to customers, ongoing product failure rates,
material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure, as well as specific product class failures outside of HP's baseline experience, affect the estimated warranty
obligation. If actual product failure rates, repair rates or any
other post sales support costs differ from these estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

As
disclosed in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, HP uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the market risk exposures in connection with certain fixed interest global
notes to achieve primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense. The table above does not reflect the interest rate swap impact on the interest rate.

HP
may redeem some or all of the Global Notes set forth in the above table at any time at the redemption prices described in the prospectus supplements relating thereto. The Global Notes
are senior unsecured debt.

In
May 2009, HP filed a shelf registration statement (the "2009 Shelf Registration Statement") with the SEC to enable the company to offer for sale, from time to time, in one or more
offerings, an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The 2009 Shelf Registration Statement replaced other registration statements filed
in March 2002 and May 2006.

In
May 2008, HP's Board of Directors approved an increase in the capacity of HP's U.S. commercial paper program by $10.0 billion to $16.0 billion. HP's subsidiaries are
authorized to issue up to an additional $1.0 billion of commercial paper, of which $500 million of capacity is currently available to be used by Hewlett-Packard International
Bank PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HP, for its Euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Programme.

HP
has a $3.0 billion five-year credit facility expiring in May 2012. In February 2009, HP entered into a $3.5 billion 364-day credit facility. The
February credit facility expired in February 2010, at which time HP entered into a new $3.5 billion 364-day credit facility maintaining the total amount available under its credit
facilities at $6.5 billion. Commitment fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit facilities vary based on HP's external credit ratings. The credit facilities are senior
unsecured committed borrowing arrangements primarily to support the issuance of U.S. commercial paper. HP's ability to have a U.S. commercial paper outstanding balance that exceeds the

in Other, including capital lease obligations, are borrowings that are collateralized by certain financing receivable assets. As of October 31, 2010, the carrying value
of the assets approximated the carrying value of the borrowings of $130 million.

As
of October 31, 2010, HP had the capacity to issue an unspecified amount of additional debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants under the
2009 Shelf Registration Statement. As of that date, HP also had up to approximately $13.8 billion of available borrowing resources, including $12.1 billion under its commercial paper
programs and approximately $1.5 billion relating to uncommitted lines of credit.

Aggregate
future maturities of long-term debt at face value (excluding a fair value adjustment related to hedged debt of $669 million, a premium on debt issuance of
$45 million, and a discount on debt issuance of $17 million) were as follows at October 31, 2010:

Amounts included in each of these respective totals will begin to expire in fiscal 2011. HP also has a capital loss carryforward of approximately $275 million which will expire in fiscal 2015.
HP has provided a valuation allowance of $145 million for deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating losses, $106 million for deferred tax assets related to capital
loss carryforwards, and $8.0 billion for deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards that HP does not expect to realize.

As
of October 31, 2010, HP had recorded deferred tax assets for various tax credit carryforwards of $733 million. This amount includes $74 million of U.S. foreign
tax credit carryforwards which begin to expire in fiscal 2011 and against which HP has recorded a valuation allowance of $47 million. HP had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of
$11 million, which do not expire, and U.S. research and development credit carryforwards of $293 million, which will begin to expire in fiscal 2024. HP also had tax credit carryforwards
of $356 million in various states and foreign countries for which HP has provided a valuation allowance of $176 million to reduce the related deferred tax asset. These credits will begin
to expire in fiscal 2011.

Gross
deferred tax assets at October 31, 2010 and 2009 were reduced by valuation allowances of $8.8 billion and $8.7 billion, respectively. The valuation allowance
increased by $77 million in fiscal 2010, consisting of $106 million associated with federal capital loss carryovers, and a net $29 million decrease associated with various net
operating losses and tax credits.

Gross
deferred tax assets at October 31, 2009 and 2008 were reduced by valuation allowances of $8.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The valuation allowance
increased by $6.9 billion in fiscal 2009. The valuation allowance increase consisted of $7.0 billion associated with foreign net operating loss carryovers arising in fiscal 2009 pursuant
to internal restructuring transactions, reduced by $100 million of valuation allowance decreases associated with state and foreign net operating losses.

Net
excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs are recorded as an increase in stockholders' equity and were approximately
$300 million in fiscal 2010, $163 million in fiscal 2009, and $316 million in fiscal 2008.

In
fiscal 2010, HP recorded $26 million of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. These amounts included adjustments to prior year foreign income tax
accruals and credits, settlement of tax audit matters, valuation allowance adjustments, and other miscellaneous discrete items.

In
fiscal 2009, HP recorded $547 million of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. The recorded amounts included $383 million of income tax benefits
attributable to net deferred tax assets for foreign net operating loss carryovers arising pursuant to internal restructuring transactions. Also included were a net tax benefit of $154 million
for the adjustment to estimated fiscal 2008 tax accruals upon filing the 2008 income tax returns, a $60 million income tax benefit for

allowance reversals for state and foreign net operating losses, and other miscellaneous items that resulted in a net tax charge of $50 million.

In
fiscal 2008, HP recorded $251 million of net income tax expense related to items unique to the year. The recorded amounts consisted of a tax charge of $205 million
associated with the post-acquisition EDS integration, $44 million for the adjustment to estimated fiscal 2007 tax accruals upon filing the 2007 U.S. federal income tax return, and
net tax charges of $2 million attributable to other items.

In
October 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was signed into law, which included a retroactive two year extension of the research and development tax credit from
January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. The retroactive income tax benefit of $45 million was recorded in HP's financial statements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

As
a result of certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in
some cases is wholly exempt from taxes, through 2024. The gross income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be $966 million ($0.41 per share) in fiscal
year 2010, $853 million ($0.35 per share) in fiscal year 2009, and $900 million ($0.35 per share) in fiscal year 2008. The gross income tax benefits were offset partially by accruals of
U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings, among other factors.

realized.

HP
recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and income tax receivables and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. As
of October 31, 2010, HP had accrued a net $181 million payable for interest and penalties. During fiscal 2010, HP recognized net interest expense net of tax on net deficiencies of
$66 million.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 14: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)

HP
engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. HP does not expect complete resolution of any IRS audit cycle
within the next 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next 12 months, including issues involving
transfer pricing and other matters.
Accordingly, HP believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by an amount up to $442 million within the next 12 months.

HP
is subject to income tax in the United States and approximately 80 foreign countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. In
addition, HP is subject to numerous ongoing audits by state and foreign tax authorities. HP has received from the IRS Notices of Deficiency for its fiscal 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005 tax years,
and Revenue Agent's Reports ("RAR") for its fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2006 tax years. The IRS began an audit of HP's 2007 income tax returns in 2009, and began its audit of HP's 2008 income tax returns
during 2010. With respect to major foreign and state tax jurisdictions, HP is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 1999. HP believes that adequate accruals have been
provided for all open tax years.

On
July 30, 2009, HP received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS for its fiscal 2004 and 2005 tax years. The Notice of Deficiency asserted that HP owes additional tax of
$92 million and penalties of $5 million. In addition to the proposed deficiency for fiscal 2004 and 2005, the IRS's adjustments for both years, if sustained, would reduce the tax
benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to subsequent years by approximately $563 million. HP plans to contest certain of the adjustments proposed in the Notice of
Deficiency. HP believes that it has provided adequate reserves for any tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from the IRS actions.

Tax
years of EDS through 2002 have been audited by the IRS, and all proposed adjustments have been resolved. The IRS is currently auditing EDS's tax years 2005, 2006, 2007 and the short
period ended August 26, 2008. On December 5, 2008, EDS received a RAR for exam years 2003 and 2004, proposing a tax deficiency of $82 million. This deficiency includes a
$12 million effect on carrybacks to 2000 and 2001. HP is appealing certain issues and believes adequate reserves have been provided for all years.

On
January 30, 2008, HP received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS for its fiscal 2003 tax year. The Notice of Deficiency asserted that HP owes additional tax of
$21 million. At the same time, HP received an RAR from the IRS for its fiscal 2002 tax year that proposed no change in HP's tax liability for that year. In addition to the proposed deficiency
for fiscal 2003, the IRS's adjustments for both years, if sustained, would reduce tax refund claims HP has filed for net operating loss carrybacks to earlier fiscal years and reduce the tax benefits
of tax credit carryforwards to subsequent years, by approximately $249 million. This amount reflects certain transfer pricing adjustments that were settled during fiscal 2008. HP plans to
contest certain remaining adjustments proposed in the Notice of Deficiency and the RAR. Towards this end, HP filed a petition with the United States Tax Court on April 29, 2008. HP believes
that it has provided adequate reserves for any tax deficiencies or reductions in refund claims that could result from the IRS actions.

On
June 28, 2007, HP received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS for its fiscal 1999 and 2000 tax years. The Notice of Deficiency asserted that HP owes additional tax of
$13 million for these two years. At the same time, HP received a RAR from IRS for its fiscal 2001 tax year that proposed no change in HP's tax liability for that year. In addition to the
proposed deficiencies for fiscal 1999 and 2000, the IRS's adjustments, if sustained, would reduce tax refund claims HP has filed for foreign tax

credit
and net operating loss carrybacks to earlier fiscal years and reduce the tax benefits of carryforwards to subsequent years, by approximately $80 million. HP plans to contest certain of
the adjustments proposed in the Notice of Deficiency and the RAR. Towards this end, HP filed a Petition with the United States Tax Court on September 25, 2007. HP believes that it has provided
adequate reserves for any tax deficiencies or reductions in refund claims that could result from the IRS actions.

HP
has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $21.9 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of October 31, 2010
because HP intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. If HP were to distribute these earnings, foreign tax credits may become available under current law to reduce
the resulting U.S. income tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. HP will remit non-indefinitely
reinvested earnings of its non-US subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. federal and withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and it determines that it is
advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.

Note 15: Stockholders' Equity

Dividends

The stockholders of HP common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by HP's Board of Directors. Dividends are
paid quarterly. Dividends declared were $0.32 per common share in each of fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Stock Repurchase Program

HP's share repurchase program authorizes both open market and private repurchase transactions. In fiscal 2010, HP executed share
repurchases of 241 million shares. Repurchases of 240 million shares were settled for $11.0 billion, which included 3 million shares repurchased in transactions that were
executed in fiscal 2009 but settled in fiscal 2010. HP had approximately 4 million shares repurchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 that will be settled in the next fiscal year. In
fiscal 2009, HP completed share repurchases of approximately 120 million shares. Repurchases of approximately 132 million shares were settled for $5.1 billion, which included
approximately 14 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal 2008 but settled in fiscal 2009. In fiscal 2008, HP completed share repurchases of approximately
230 million shares. Repurchases of approximately 216 million shares were settled for $9.6 billion, which included approximately 1 million shares repurchased in transactions
that were executed in fiscal 2007 but settled in fiscal 2008. The foregoing shares repurchased and settled in fiscal 2010, fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 were all open market repurchase transactions.

In
fiscal 2010, HP's Board of Directors authorized an additional $18.0 billion for future share repurchases. In fiscal 2009, there was no additional authorization for future share
repurchases by HP's Board of Directors. In fiscal 2008, HP's Board of Directors authorized an additional $16.0 billion for future share repurchases. As of October 31, 2010, HP had
remaining authorization of approximately $10.9 billion for future share repurchases.

Note 16: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Acquisition of EDS

On August 26, 2008, EDS became a wholly-owned subsidiary of HP. EDS sponsors qualified and non-qualified defined
benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees. The majority of the EDS defined benefit pension plans are noncontributory. In most plans, employees become fully vested upon
attaining two to five years of service, and benefits are based on many factors, which differ by country, but the most significant is years of service and earnings. The projected unit credit cost
method is used for actuarial purposes. Plan assets and plan obligations associated with the EDS defined benefit pension plans were included as of the acquisition date and through October 31,
2008. On a global basis, EDS plan assets totaled $7.8 billion and plan obligations totaled $10.1 billion as of August 26, 2008. The U.S. portion of global assets and obligations
totaled $4.1 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively.

Defined Benefit Plans

HP sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans worldwide, of which the most significant are in the United States. Both the HP
Retirement Plan (the "Retirement Plan"), a traditional defined benefit pension plan based on pay and years of service, and the HP Company Cash Account Pension Plan (the "Cash Account Pension Plan"),
under which benefits are accrued pursuant to a cash accumulation account formula based upon a percentage of pay plus interest, were frozen effective January 1, 2008. The Cash Account Pension
Plan and the Retirement Plan were merged in 2005 for certain funding and investment purposes. The merged plan is referred to as the HP Pension Plan.

Following
the acquisition of EDS, HP announced that it was modifying the EDS U.S. qualified and non-qualified plans for employees accruing benefits under the programs.
Effective January 1, 2009, EDS employees in the U.S. ceased accruing pension benefits, and the final pension benefit for EDS employees who retire on and after that date will be calculated based
on pay and service through December 31, 2008.

Effective
October 30, 2009, the EDS U.S. qualified pension plan was also merged into the HP Pension Plan. The EDS U.S. qualified pension plan, like the Cash Account Pension Plan
and the Retirement Plan, remains a separate sub-plan within the HP Pension Plan for purposes of determining benefit amounts. As a result, the merger had no impact on the separate benefit
structures of the plans.

HP
reduces the benefit payable to a U.S. employee under the Retirement Plan for service before 1993, if any, by any amounts due to the employee under HP's frozen defined contribution
Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (the "DPSP"). HP closed the DPSP to new participants in 1993. The DPSP plan obligations are equal to the plan assets and are recognized as an offset to the Pension Plan
when HP calculates its defined benefit pension cost and obligations. The fair value of plan assets and projected

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Through fiscal 2005, substantially all of HP's U.S. employees at December 31, 2002 could become eligible for partially
subsidized retiree medical benefits and retiree life insurance benefits under the Pre-2003 HP Retiree Medical Program (the "Pre-2003 Program") and certain other retiree medical
programs. Plan participants in the Pre-2003 Program make contributions based on their choice of medical option and
length of service. U.S. employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2003 may become eligible to participate in a post-retirement medical plan, the HP Retiree Medical Program,
but must bear the full cost of their participation. Effective January 1, 2006, employees whose combination of age and years of service was less than 62 no longer were eligible for the
subsidized Pre-2003 Program, but instead were eligible for the HP Retiree Medical Program. Employees no longer eligible for the Pre-2003 Program, as well as employees hired on
or after January 1, 2003, are eligible for certain credits under the HP Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan ("RMSA Plan") upon attaining age 45. Upon retirement, former employees may use
credits under the RMSA Plan for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses, including premiums required for coverage under the HP Retiree Medical Program. In February 2007, HP further
limited future eligibility for the Pre-2003 HP Retiree Medical Program to those employees who were within five years of satisfying the program's retirement criteria on June 30,
2007. Employees not meeting the modified program criteria may become eligible for participation in the HP Retiree Medical Program. In November 2008, HP announced that it was changing the limits on
future cost-sharing for the Pre-2003 Program whereby all future cost increases will be paid by participating retirees starting in 2011. In June 2008, HP modified the RMSA Plan
to provide that generally only those employees who were employed with HP as of July 31, 2008 would be eligible to receive employer credits. In September 2008, HP further modified the RMSA Plan
to provide that such employees would receive employer credits only in the form of matching contributions.

HP
currently collects a retiree drug subsidy from the U.S. federal government relating to the retiree prescription drug benefits that it provides. Collecting the retiree drug subsidy is
one of several alternatives under Medicare Part D that employers have in financing these benefits. In March 2010, HP decided to contract with a prescription drug plan, leveraging the employer
group waiver plan process, to provide group benefits under Medicare Part D as an alternative to collecting the retiree drug subsidy. This change in retiree prescription drug financing strategy
will take effect in 2013, and, due to the health care reform legislation enacted in March 2010, is expected to give HP access to greater U.S. federal subsidies over time to help pay for retiree
benefits. Aside from this impact, the health care



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

reform
legislation is not expected to affect the cost of HP's retiree welfare programs because the subsidy offered by HP is fixed.

During
fiscal year 2010, HP also announced the elimination of company-paid retiree life insurance effective January 1, 2011.

Defined Contribution Plans

HP offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution expense was
$535 million in fiscal 2010, $568 million in fiscal 2009 and $548 million in fiscal 2008. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in
the Hewlett-Packard Company 401(k) Plan (the "HP 401(k) Plan") when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. Similar to HP, EDS offered participation in defined
contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees, including an EDS 401(k) Plan.

During
fiscal 2008, HP matched employee contributions to the HP 401(k) Plan with cash contributions up to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation for U.S. employees hired prior to
August 1, 2008. For U.S. employees hired on or after August 1, 2008 HP matched employee contributions up to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation.

The
employer match for the EDS 401(k) Plan was 25% of the employee contribution based on a maximum contribution of 6% of the employee's salary. Effective January 1, 2009, U.S.
employees participating in the EDS 401(k) Plan became eligible for a 4% matching contribution on eligible compensation. Similar to the HP 401(k) Plan, contributions are invested at the direction of
the employee in various funds, although the EDS 401(k) Plan does not offer an HP stock fund.

Effective
April 1, 2009, HP matching contributions under both the HP 401(k) Plan and the EDS 401(k) Plan were changed to a quarterly, discretionary, performance-based match of up
to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation for all U.S. employees to be determined each fiscal quarter based on business results. HP matching contributions may vary from 0% to 100% of the maximum 4%
match, based on such factors as quarterly earnings, market share growth, and performance relative to market and economic conditions. HP's matching contributions for each of the quarters in fiscal 2010
were 100% of the maximum 4% match. Effective November 2010, the quarterly employer matching contributions in the HP 401(k) Plan and the EDS 401(k) Plan will no longer be discretionary, but will be
equal to 100% of an employee's contributions, up to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation.

Effective
January 31, 2004, HP designated the HP Stock Fund, an investment option under the HP 401(k) Plan, as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and, as a result, participants in
the HP Stock Fund may receive dividends in cash or may reinvest such dividends into the HP Stock Fund. HP paid approximately $7 million, $8 million, and $9 million in dividends
for the HP common shares held by the HP Stock Fund in fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. HP records the dividends as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders' Equity. The HP Stock Fund held approximately 22 million shares of HP common stock at October 31, 2010.

In
fiscal 2010, HP recognized aggregate pension curtailment gains and settlement losses totaling $6 million and $7 million, respectively, resulting from workforce
rebalancing initiatives in several non-U.S. countries. In the United Kingdom, workforce rebalancing initiatives triggered pension termination benefits totaling $29 million. In the
United States, a settlement loss of $7 million was recognized for payout activity related to non-qualified plans and a curtailment gain of $13 million was recognized for the
elimination of life insurance benefits.

Plan Asset Valuations

The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for pension plan assets measured at fair value. There have been no
changes in the methodologies used during the reporting period.

Investments
in securities are valued at the closing price reported on the stock exchange in which the individual securities are traded. For corporate, government, and asset-backed debt
securities, fair value is based upon observable inputs of comparable market transactions. For corporate and government debt securities traded on active exchanges, fair value is based upon observable
quoted prices. Underlying assets for alternative investments such as limited partnerships, joint ventures and private
equities are determined by the general partner or the general partner's designee on a quarter or periodic basis. The valuation for these assets requires judgment due to the absence of quoted market
prices, and these assets are therefore classified as Level 3. Cash and cash equivalents includes money market accounts, which are valued based on the net asset value of the shares. Other assets
were valued based upon the level of input (e.g., quoted prices, observable inputs (other than Level 1) or unobservable inputs that were significant to the fair value measurement of the
assets).

Investment Policy

HP's investment strategy for worldwide plan assets is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk
depending on the funded status of each plan. The majority of the plans' investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which
they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans' investment
managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and HP utilizes derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability
exposures.

The
target asset allocation selected for each U.S. plan reflects a risk/return profile HP feels is appropriate relative to each plan's liability structure and return goals. HP conducts
periodic asset-liability studies for U.S. plan assets in order to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plan's forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs. HP
invests a portion of the U.S. defined benefit plan assets and post-retirement benefit plan assets in private market securities such as venture capital funds to provide diversification and
higher expected returns.

Outside
the United States, asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees. As in the U.S., investment objectives are designed to generate returns that
will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In some countries local regulations require adjustments in asset
allocation, typically leading to a higher percentage in fixed income than would otherwise be deployed. HP's investment subsidiary acts in a consulting and governance role in reviewing investment
strategy and providing a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions on asset allocation and investment managers made by local trustees.

Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term rate of return on assets for each U.S. plan reflects the expected returns for each major asset class
in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

Expected
asset class returns reflect the current yield on U.S. government bonds and risk premiums for each asset class. Because HP's investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers
who seek to outperform the broader market, the asset class expected returns are adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns net of fees.

HP
closed the acquisition of EDS on August 26, 2008. Effective immediately before the close of fiscal 2009, HP merged the assets of the HP and EDS U.S. pension plans. The expected
return on the plan assets, used in calculating the net benefit costs, is 8.0% for fiscal 2011, which reflects the result of the most recent asset allocation study and is commensurate with the
investment strategy for the merged U.S. pension plan.

The
approach used to arrive at the expected rate of return on assets for the non-U.S. plans reflects the asset allocation policy of each plan and the expected country real
returns for equity and fixed income investments. On an annual basis, HP gathers empirical data from the local country subsidiaries to determine expected long-term rates of return for
equity and fixed income securities. HP then weights these expected real rates of return based on country specific allocation mixes adjusted for inflation.

Future Contributions and Funding Policy

In fiscal 2011, HP expects to contribute approximately $747 million to its pension plans and approximately $30 million to
cover benefit payments to U.S.
non-qualified plan participants. HP expects to pay approximately $40 million to cover benefit claims for HP's post-retirement benefit plans. HP's funding policy is to
contribute cash to its pension plans so that it meets at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding and taxing authorities.

Estimated Future Benefits Payable

HP estimates that the future benefits payable for the retirement and post-retirement plans in place were as follows at

Note 17: Commitments

HP leases certain real and personal property under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain leases require HP to pay property taxes, insurance and routine maintenance and
include renewal options and escalation clauses. Rent expense was approximately $1,062 million in fiscal 2010, $1,112 million in fiscal 2009 and $935 million in fiscal 2008.
Sublease rental income was approximately $46 million in fiscal 2010, $53 million in fiscal 2009 and $37 million in fiscal 2008.

At
October 31, 2010 and October 31, 2009, property under capital lease, which was comprised primarily of equipment and furniture, was approximately $688 million and
$723 million, respectively and was included in property, plant and equipment in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Accumulated depreciation on the property under capital lease was
approximately $482 million and $406 million, respectively, at October 31, 2010 and October 31, 2009. The related depreciation is included in depreciation expense.

Note 18: Litigation and Contingencies

HP is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities, employment, employee
benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP records a provision for a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. HP believes it has adequate provisions for any such matters. HP reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these
provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Based on its experience, HP believes
that any damage amounts claimed

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 18: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

in
the specific matters discussed below are not a meaningful indicator of HP's potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, HP believes that it has valid defenses with respect
to legal matters pending against it. Nevertheless, it is possible that cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or
more of these contingencies or because of the diversion of management's attention and the creation of significant expenses.

Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations

Copyright levies

.

As described below, proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving HP in certain European
Union ("EU") member countries, including litigation in Germany and Belgium, seeking to impose or modify levies upon equipment (such as multifunction devices ("MFDs"), personal computers ("PCs") and
printers) and alleging that these devices enable producing private copies of copyrighted materials. The levies are generally based upon the number of products sold and the per-product
amounts of the levies, which vary. Some EU member countries that do not yet have levies on digital devices are expected to implement similar legislation to enable them to extend existing levy schemes,
while some other EU member countries are expected to limit the scope of levy schemes and applicability in the digital hardware environment. HP, other companies and various industry associations have
opposed the extension of levies to the digital environment and have advocated alternative models of compensation to rights holders.

VerwertungsGesellschaft
Wort ("VG Wort"), a collection agency representing certain copyright holders, instituted legal proceedings against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court seeking levies
on printers. On December 22, 2004, the court held that HP is liable for payments regarding all printers using ASCII code sold in Germany but did not determine the amount payable per unit. HP
appealed this decision in January 2005 to the Stuttgart Court of Appeals. On May 11, 2005, the Stuttgart Court of Appeals issued a decision confirming that levies are due. On June 6,
2005, HP filed an appeal to the German Federal Supreme Court in Karlsruhe. On December 6, 2007, the German Federal Supreme Court issued a judgment that printers are not subject to levies under
the existing law. The court issued a written decision on January 25, 2008, and VG Wort subsequently filed an application with the German Federal Supreme Court under Section 321a of the
German Code of Civil Procedure contending that the court did not consider their arguments. On May 9, 2008, the German Federal Supreme Court denied VG Wort's application. VG Wort appealed the
decision by filing a claim with the German Federal Constitutional Court challenging the ruling that printers are not subject to levies. On September 21, 2010, the Constitutional Court published
a decision holding that the German Federal Supreme Court erred by not referring questions on interpretation of German copyright law to the Court of Justice of the European Union and therefore revoked
the German Federal Supreme Court decision and remitted the matter to it. The German Federal Supreme Court has set a hearing date of March 24, 2011.

In
September 2003, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against Fujitsu Siemens Computer GmbH ("FSC") in the Munich Civil Court in Munich, Germany seeking levies on PCs. This is an industry
test case in Germany, and HP has agreed not to object to the delay if VG Wort sues HP for such levies on PCs following a final decision against FSC. On December 23, 2004, the Munich Civil Court
held that PCs are subject to a levy and that FSC must pay €12 plus compound interest for each PC sold in Germany since March 2001. FSC appealed this decision in January 2005 to the
Munich Court of Appeals. On December 15, 2005, the Munich Court of Appeals affirmed the Munich Civil Court decision. FSC filed an appeal with the German Federal Supreme Court in February 2006.
On October 2, 2008, the German

Note 18: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

Federal
Supreme Court issued a judgment that PCs were not photocopiers within the meaning of the German copyright law that was in effect until December 31, 2007 and, therefore, not subject to
the levies on photocopiers established by that law. VG Wort has filed a claim with the German Federal Constitutional Court challenging that ruling. FSC and BITKOM have responded to VG Wort's claim,
and the parties are awaiting a decision by the court as to whether it will accept or decide on the claim for judicial review.

Reprobel,
a cooperative society with the authority to collect and distribute the remuneration for reprography to Belgian copyright holders, requested HP by extra-judicial means to amend
certain copyright levy declarations submitted for inkjet MFDs sold in Belgium from January 2005 to December 2009 to enable it to collect copyright levies calculated based on the generally higher
copying speed when the MFDs are operated in draft print mode rather than when operated in normal print mode. In March 2010, HP filed a lawsuit against Reprobel in the French-speaking chambers of the
Court of First Instance of Brussels seeking a declaratory judgment that no copyright levies are payable on sales of MFDs in Belgium or, alternatively, that copyright levies payable on such MFDs must
be assessed based on the copying speed when operated in the normal print mode set by default in the device. The schedule for the court proceedings has been determined, and no decision from the court
is expected before September 2012.

Based
on industry opposition to the extension of levies to digital products, HP's assessments of the merits of various proceedings and HP's estimates of the units impacted and levies, HP
has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the matters described above. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters and the associated financial impact on HP, including the
number of units impacted, the amount of levies imposed and the ability of HP to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.

Skold, et al. v. Intel Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company

is a lawsuit in which HP was joined on
June 14, 2004 that is pending in state court in Santa Clara County, California. The lawsuit alleges that HP (along with Intel) misled the public by suppressing and concealing the alleged
material fact that systems that use the Intel Pentium 4 processor are less powerful and slower than systems using the Intel Pentium III processor and processors made by a competitor of Intel. The
plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, restitution, attorneys' fees and costs, and certification of a nationwide class. On February 27, 2009, the court denied with prejudice plaintiffs' motion
for nationwide class certification for a third time. The plaintiffs have appealed the court's decision.

Inkjet Printer Litigation.

As described below, HP is involved in several lawsuits claiming breach of express and implied
warranty, unjust enrichment, deceptive advertising and unfair business practices where the plaintiffs have alleged, among other things, that HP employed a "smart chip" in certain inkjet printing
products in order to register ink depletion prematurely and to render the cartridge unusable through a built-in expiration date that is hidden, not documented in marketing materials to
consumers, or both. The plaintiffs have also contended that consumers received false ink depletion warnings and that the smart chip limits the ability of consumers to use the cartridge to its full
capacity or to choose competitive products.

Four class actions against HP and its subsidiary, Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Co., are pending in Canada, one
commenced in British Columbia in February 2006, two commenced in Quebec in April 2006 and May 2006, respectively, and one commenced in Ontario in June 2006, where the plaintiffs are seeking class
certification, restitution, declaratory relief, injunctive relief and unspecified statutory, compensatory and punitive damages. In March 2010, one of the Quebec cases was voluntarily dismissed by the
plaintiff.

entered into an
agreement to settle those lawsuits on behalf of the proposed classes, which agreement is subject to approval of the court before it becomes final. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, the
lawsuits will be consolidated, and eligible class members will each have the right to obtain e-credits not to exceed $5 million in the aggregate for use in purchasing printers or
printer supplies through HP's website. As part of the proposed settlement, HP also agreed to provide class members with additional information regarding HP inkjet printer functionality and to change
the content of certain software and user guide messaging provided to users regarding the life of inkjet printer cartridges. In addition, class counsel and the class representatives will be paid
attorneys' fees and expenses and stipends in an amount that is yet to be approved by the court. On October 1, 2010, the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement. The court
has scheduled a fairness hearing on January 28, 2011 to determine whether to grant final approval of the proposed settlement.

Baggett v. HP

is a consumer class action filed against HP on June 6, 2007 in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California alleging that HP employs a technology in its LaserJet color printers whereby the printing process shuts down prematurely, thus preventing
customers from using the toner that is allegedly left in the cartridge. The plaintiffs also allege that HP fails to disclose to consumers that they will be unable to utilize the toner remaining in the
cartridge after the printer shuts down. The complaint seeks certification of a nationwide class of purchasers of all HP LaserJet color printers and seeks unspecified damages, restitution,
disgorgement, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs. On September 29, 2009, the court granted HP's motion for summary judgment against the named plaintiff and denied plaintiff's motion
for class certification as moot. On November 3, 2009, the court entered judgment against the named plaintiff. On November 17, 2009, plaintiff filed an appeal of the court's summary
judgment ruling with the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On August 25, 2010, HP and the plaintiff entered into an agreement to

Fair Labor Standards Act Litigation.

HP is involved in several lawsuits in which the plaintiffs are seeking unpaid
overtime compensation and other damages based on allegations that various employees of EDS or HP have been misclassified as exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and/or in violation of
the California Labor Code or other state laws. Those matters include the following:

•

Cunningham and Cunningham, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

is a purported collective action filed on May 10, 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York claiming that current
and former EDS employees involved in installing and/or maintaining computer software and hardware were misclassified as exempt employees. Another purported collective action,

Steavens, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

, which was filed on October 23, 2007, is also now pending in
the same court alleging similar facts. The

Steavens

case has been consolidated for pretrial purposes with the

Cunningham

case. On
December 14, 2010, the court granted conditional certification of the class in the consolidated

Cunningham

and

Steavens

matter.

•

Heffelfinger, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

is a class action filed in November 2006 in California Superior Court claiming that certain EDS information technology workers in California were
misclassified as exempt employees. The case was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, which, on January 7, 2008, certified a class of
information technology workers in California. On June 6, 2008, the court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which is pending. Two other purported class actions originally filed in California Superior Court,

India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings.

As described below, Hewlett-Packard India Sales
Private Ltd ("HPI"), a subsidiary of HP, and certain current and former HP employees have received show cause notices from the India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (the "DRI") alleging
underpayment of certain customs duties:

•

On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the DRI issued show cause notices to HPI, seven current HP employees and one
former HP employee alleging that HP has underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $370 million, plus
penalties. On June 2, 2010, the DRI issued an additional show

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 18: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

cause
notice to HPI and three current HPI employees alleging that HP failed to pay customs duties on the appropriate value of recovery CDs containing Microsoft operating systems and seeking to recover
approximately $5.3 million, plus penalties. HP has deposited a total of approximately $16.7 million with the DRI and agreed to post a provisional bond in exchange for the DRI's agreement
not to seize HP products and spare parts and not to interrupt the transaction of business by HP in India.

•

On June 17, 2010, the DRI issued show cause notices to HPI and two current HPI employees regarding
non-inclusion of the value of software contained in the products imported from third party original design manufacturers. The total amount of the alleged unpaid customs duties relating to
such software, including the interest proposed to be demanded under these notices, is approximately $130,000, which amount HPI has deposited with the DRI. The DRI is also seeking to impose penalties.

•

On October 1, 2010, in connection with an existing DRI investigation commenced against SAP AG, the DRI issued a
show cause notice to HPI alleging underpayment of customs duties related to the importation of certain SAP software. The amount of the alleged duty differential is approximately $38,000, which amount
has been deposited with the DRI. The DRI is also seeking to impose interest and penalties.

HP
intends to contest each of the show cause notices through the judicial process. HP has responded or is in the process of responding to the show cause notices.

Russia GPO and Related Investigations.

The German Public Prosecutor's Office ("German PPO") has been conducting
an investigation into allegations that current and former employees of HP engaged in bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion relating to a transaction between Hewlett-Packard ISE GmbH in Germany,
a former subsidiary of HP, and the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. The €35 million transaction, which was referred to as the Russia GPO deal,
spanned the years 2001 to 2006 and was for the delivery and installation of an IT network.

The
U.S. Department of Justice and the SEC have also been conducting an investigation into the Russia GPO deal and potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
("FCPA"). Under the FCPA, a person or an entity could be subject to fines, civil penalties of up to $500,000 per violation and equitable remedies, including disgorgement and other injunctive relief.
In addition, criminal penalties could range from the greater of $2 million per violation or twice the gross pecuniary gain or loss from the violation.

In
addition to information about the Russia GPO deal, the U.S. enforcement authorities have requested (i) information related to certain other transactions, including
transactions in Russia, Serbia and in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) subregion dating back to 2000, and (ii) information related to two former HP executives seconded to Russia and to
whether HP personnel in Russia, Germany, Austria, Serbia, the Netherlands or CIS were involved in kickbacks or other improper payments to channel partners, or state owned or private entities.

HP
is cooperating with these investigating agencies.

In
addition, as described below, HP is involved in stockholder derivative litigation arising from the Russia GPO deal, the related investigations and other matters commenced
against current and former

members
of the HP Board of Directors in which the plaintiffs are seeking to recover certain compensation paid by HP to the defendants and other damages:

•

Henrietta Klein v. Mark V. Hurd, et al.,

is a
lawsuit filed on September 24, 2010 in California Superior Court alleging the individual defendants wasted corporate assets and breached their fiduciary duties by failing to implement and
oversee HP's compliance with the FCPA.

•

Saginaw Police & Fire Pension Fund v. Marc L. Andreessen, et
al.,

is a lawsuit filed on October 19, 2010 in United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging, among other things, that the
defendants breached their fiduciary duties and were unjustly enriched by consciously disregarding HP's alleged violations of the FCPA.

Leak Investigation Proceedings

.

As described below, HP is or has been the subject of various governmental inquiries
concerning the processes employed in an investigation into leaks of HP confidential information to members of the media that concluded in May 2006:

•

In August 2006, HP was informally contacted by the Attorney General of the State of California requesting information
concerning the processes employed in the leak investigation. On December 7, 2006, HP announced that it entered into an agreement with the California Attorney General to resolve civil claims
arising from the leak investigation, including a claim made by the California Attorney General in a Santa Clara County Superior Court action filed on December 7, 2006, that HP committed unfair
business practices under California law in connection with the leak investigation. As a result of this agreement, which includes an injunction, the California Attorney General will not pursue civil
claims against HP or its current and former directors, officers and employees. Under the terms of the agreement, HP paid a total of $14.5 million and agreed to implement and maintain for five
years a series of measures designed to ensure that HP's corporate investigations are conducted in accordance with California law and the company's high ethical standards. Of the $14.5 million,
$13.5 million has been used to create a Privacy and Piracy Fund to assist California prosecutors in investigating and prosecuting consumer privacy and information piracy violations, $650,000
was used to pay statutory damages and $350,000 reimbursed the California Attorney General's office for its investigation costs. There was no finding of liability against HP as part of the settlement.

•

Beginning in September 2006, HP received requests from the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the U.S. House of
Representatives (the "Committee") for records and information concerning the leak investigation, securities transactions by HP officers and directors, including an August 25, 2006, securities
transaction by Mark Hurd, HP's former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related matters. HP has responded to those requests. In addition, Mr. Hurd voluntarily gave testimony to the
Committee regarding the leak investigation on September 28, 2006.

•

In September 2006, HP was informally contacted by the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting
similar information concerning the processes employed in the leak investigation. HP has responded to that request.

•

Beginning in September 2006, HP has received requests from the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for records and information and interviews with current and former HP directors and officers relating to the leak investigation, the resignation of Thomas J. Perkins from HP's Board
of Directors, HP's May 22, 2006 and September 6, 2006 filings with the SEC on Form 8-K, stock repurchases by HP and securities transactions by its officers and
directors that occurred between May 1 and October 1, 2006, and HP's policies, practices and approval of securities transactions. In May 2007, HP consented to the entry of an order by the
SEC ordering HP to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of the public reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. HP has been advised by the staff of
the Division of Enforcement that the staff has completed its investigation and does not intend to recommend that any other SEC enforcement action be brought in connection with these matters.

•

In September 2006, HP received a request from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for records and information
relating to the processes employed in the leak investigation. HP has responded to that request.

In
addition, four stockholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in California purportedly on behalf of HP stockholders seeking to recover damages for alleged breach of fiduciary duty
and to require HP to improve its corporate governance and internal control procedures as a result of the activities of the leak investigation:

Staehr v.
Dunn, et al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 18, 2006;

Worsham v.
Dunn, et al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 14, 2006;

Tansey v.
Dunn, et al

.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 20, 2006; and

Hall v.
Dunn, et al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 25, 2006. On October 19, 2006, the Santa Clara County
Superior Court consolidated the four California cases under the caption

In re Hewlett-Packard Company Derivative
Litigation

. The consolidated complaint filed on November 19, 2006, also seeks to recover damages in connection with sales of HP stock alleged to have been
made by certain current and former HP officers and directors while in possession of material non-public information. Two additional stockholder derivative lawsuits,

Pifko v. Babbio, et al

.

, filed on September 19, 2006, and

Gross v. Babbio, et al.

, filed on November 21, 2006, were filed in Chancery Court, County of
New Castle, Delaware; both seek to recover damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and to obtain an order instructing the defendants to refrain from further breaches of fiduciary duty and to
implement corrective measures that will prevent future occurrences of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. On January 24, 2007, the Delaware court consolidated the two cases under the
caption

In re Hewlett-Packard Company Derivative Litigation

and subsequently stayed the proceedings, as the parties had
reached a tentative settlement. The HP Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee consisting of independent Board members authorized to investigate, review and evaluate the facts and
circumstances asserted in these derivative matters and to determine how HP should proceed in these matters. On December 14, 2007, HP and the plaintiffs in the California and Delaware derivative
actions entered into an agreement to settle those lawsuits. Under the terms of the settlement, HP agreed to continue certain corporate governance changes until December 31, 2012 and to pay the
plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. The California court granted final approval to the settlement on March 11, 2008 and subsequently granted plaintiffs' counsel's fee application and dismissed the
action. On June 12, 2008, the Delaware court granted final approval to the settlement and the plaintiffs' application for attorneys' fees and also dismissed the action. Because neither the
dismissal of the California nor the Delaware derivative action was thereafter appealed, both cases are now concluded.

Environmental

HP is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws
addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the materials used in its products,
and the recycling, treatment and disposal of its products including batteries. In particular, HP faces increasing complexity in its product design and procurement operations as it adjusts to new and
future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of its products, their safe use, and the energy consumption associated with those products, including requirements relating to
climate change. HP products are also subject to product take-back legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions. HP could incur substantial costs, its products could be restricted
from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if its products become non-compliant with
environmental laws. HP's potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean up costs. The amount and timing of costs
under environmental laws are difficult to predict.

HP
is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
("CERCLA"), known as "Superfund," or state laws similar to CERCLA. HP is also conducting environmental investigations or remediations at several current or former operating sites pursuant to
administrative orders or consent agreements with state environmental agencies.

Corporate Investments

includes HP Labs, network infrastructure products,
mobile devices associated with the Palm acquisition, and certain business incubation projects. Revenue in this segment is attributable to the sale of certain network infrastructure products, which
span from the data center to the edge of the network and are sold under the ProCurve, 3Com and TippingPoint brands. The segment also includes certain video collaboration products sold under the brand
"Halo," and Palm smartphones, which are targeted at the consumer segment and include the Pixi and Pre models running on the WebOS operating system. This segment also derives revenue from licensing
specific HP technology to third parties.

Segment Data

HP derives the results of the business segments directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting
policies HP uses to derive business segment results are substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. Management measures the performance of each business segment based on
several metrics, including earnings from operations. Management uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the business segments. HP does not
allocate to its business segments certain operating expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include primarily restructuring charges and any associated
adjustments related to restructuring actions, amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense related to HP-granted employee stock options, PRUs, restricted
stock awards and the employee stock purchase plan, certain acquisition-related charges and charges for purchased IPR&D, as well as certain corporate governance costs.

ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Controls and Procedures

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the "Evaluation Date"). Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to HP, including our
consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to HP's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of any changes
in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during our most recently
completed fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that there has not been any change in our internal control over financial
reporting during that quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

See
Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 9B. Other Information.

The disclosure below is included in this report in lieu of filing a Current Report on Form 8-K to report events that have
occurred within four business days prior to the filing of this report.

On
December 15, 2010, HP entered into a Letter Agreement (the "Agreement") with Catherine A. Lesjak, HP's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The
following is a summary of the principal terms of the Agreement:

•

The term of the Agreement is three years, during which time Ms. Lesjak will continue to serve as HP's Executive
Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

•

During the term of the Agreement, Ms. Lesjak's annual base salary and target annual incentive will be maintained at
their current levels, and the long-term incentive awards that she has been granted to date will not be reduced, provided that the Board of Directors may grant future increases, and provided further
that each may be reduced if, respectively, the base salaries, target annual incentives, and/or long-term incentive awards are reduced for substantially all other Executive Vice Presidents in a
substantially similar manner.

•

In the event of a "qualifying termination" (as defined in the Agreement) of her employment with HP during the term of the
Agreement, Ms. Lesjak will receive (i) a cash severance benefit under the Hewlett-Packard Company Severance Plan for Executive Officers calculated by multiplying by two the sum of
(A) her annual base salary as in effect immediately before termination of employment and (B) average annualized cash bonus under the Hewlett-Packard



Company
2005 Pay for Results Plan (the "PfR Plan") for the two full fiscal years' prior to termination of employment, (ii) a pro-rata annual cash bonus under the PfR Plan for the fiscal year in
which her termination occurs, (iii) payout on any performance-based restricted stock unit awards based on actual performance as if she had remained employed during the entire performance
period, and (iv) the release of all restrictions and accelerated vesting of other equity awards.

•

In the event of a "qualifying termination" (as defined in the Agreement) of her employment with HP during the term of the
Agreement and within 12 months after a "change in control" of HP (as defined in the Hewlett-Packard Company Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan), Ms Lesjak will receive the same benefits
described in the preceding paragraph except that (i) the pro-rata annual cash bonus under the PfR Plan for the fiscal year in which her termination occurs will be determined assuming continued
accruals with respect to such bonus at the rate in effect immediately prior to the change in control, and (ii) the payout on her performance-based restricted stock unit awards will be
determined assuming target performance on all metrics for all uncompleted periods.

The
foregoing summary of the Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Agreement, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10(l)(l)(l)
and is incorporated herein by reference.
