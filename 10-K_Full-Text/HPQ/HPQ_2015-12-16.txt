PART I

ITEM 1. Business.

Business Overview

We are a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and
medium-sized businesses ("SMBs") and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors.

HP
was incorporated in 1947 under the laws of the state of California as the successor to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard. Effective in May 1998, we
changed our state of incorporation from California to Delaware.

HP Separation Transaction

On November 1, 2015 (the "Distribution Date"), Hewlett-Packard Company completed the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
Company ("Hewlett Packard Enterprise"), Hewlett-Packard Company's former enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses (the "Separation"). In connection with the
Separation, Hewlett-Packard Company changed its name to HP Inc. Accordingly, references to the "company" in this report refer to Hewlett-Packard Company with respect to events occurring on or
prior to October 31, 2015, and to HP Inc. with respect to events occurring after October 31, 2015.

On
November 1, 2015, each of our stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 21, 2015 (the "Record Date") received one share of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
common stock for every one share of our common stock held as of the Record Date.

Hewlett
Packard Enterprise is now an independent public company trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "HPE". After the Separation, we do not beneficially own
any shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock and beginning November 1, 2015, we no longer consolidate Hewlett Packard Enterprise within our financial results or reflect the financial
results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise within our continuing results of operations.

The
historical results of operations and the financial position of Hewlett Packard Enterprise are included in the consolidated financial statements of HP Inc. for each of the
fiscal years included in this report and will be reported as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

HP Products and Services; Segment Information

Our offerings span the following:

•

personal computing and other access devices;

•

imaging- and printing-related products and services;

•

enterprise information technology ("IT") infrastructure, including enterprise server and storage technology, networking products and
solutions, technology support and maintenance;

•

multi-vendor customer services, including technology consulting, outsourcing and support services across infrastructure, applications
and business process domains; and

•

software products and solution, including application testing and delivery software, big data analytics, information governance and IT
Operations Management.

We
offer one of the IT industry's broadest portfolios of products and services that bring together infrastructure, software, and services through innovation to enable our customers to
create value and solve business problems. As consumers and enterprises shift the way technology is created, delivered,



consumed
and paid for, they are demanding a foundation that will support much greater agility, lower cost, facilitate quicker time-to-market, and provide a higher degree of accessibility by end-users
to that technology. We design our solutions to provide that foundation, particularly in the areas of security, cloud, mobility and big data, by leveraging the breadth of our offerings and the
strengths and capabilities of our individual business units.

Our
operations are organized into seven business segments: Personal Systems; Printing; the Enterprise Group ("EG"); Enterprise Services ("ES"); Software; HP Financial Services ("HPFS");
and Corporate Investments. As a result of the Separation, effective November 1, 2015 EG, ES, Software, HPFS and certain parts of Corporate Investments are no longer reported in the continuing
results of HP Inc. Personal Systems, Printing and the remaining parts of Corporate Investments segments will be HP Inc.'s reportable segments.

In
each of the past three fiscal years, notebook personal computers ("PCs"), printing supplies, infrastructure technology outsourcing services, desktop PCs and industry standard servers
("ISS") each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue.

The
Personal Systems segment and the Printing segment are structured beneath a broader Printing and Personal Systems Group ("PPS"). While PPS is not a reportable segment, we may provide
financial data aggregating the Personal Systems and Printing segments to provide a supplementary view of its business.

A
summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our segments along with a description of our fiscal 2015 organizational realignments can be found in Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. A discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in "Risk Factors" in
Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Printing and Personal Systems Group

The mission of PPS is to leverage the respective strengths of the Personal Systems segment and the Printing segment by creating a

Corporate Investments

Corporate Investments includes HP Labs, certain enterprise-related business incubation projects and venture focused minority

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above. Our customers are organized by
consumer and commercial groups, and purchases of HP products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by HP or indirectly through a variety of partners,
including:

•

retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or Internet stores;

•

resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer
groups;

•

distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers;

•

original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") that integrate our products and services with their own products and services, and sell the
integrated solution;

•

independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products
and services to clients purchasing their products;

•

systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often partner with us to extend their
expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and



•

advisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems integration work, and typically
partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services.

The
mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market
conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage, in addition to identifying efficiencies and
productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses. While each of our business segments manages the execution of its own go-to-market and distribution strategy, our business segments also
collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate. For example, we typically assign an account manager to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise
customers. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For other customers and for consumers, PPS typically manages direct online sales as well as
channel relationships with retailers, while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting SMBs where appropriate.

Manufacturing and Materials

We utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers ("OMs") around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. The use of
OMs is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for HP-designed products. We use multiple OMs to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing
processes. In some circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under the HP brand. In addition to our use of OMs, we currently manufacture a limited number of
finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.

We
utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and
logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units to match a customer's particular hardware and software
customization requirements. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by
taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers.

We
purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate
sources of supply are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines, LaserJet supplies,
certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption). We are dependent upon Intel
and AMD as suppliers of x86 processors and Microsoft for various software products; however, we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore
would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. See "Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage
our suppliers effectively," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Like
other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand
requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from
multiple sources. Frequently, we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt
production. We also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing



commitments
with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supplies. See "Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we
fail to manage our suppliers effectively," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

International

Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis
for both consumer and enterprise customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset
geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. In addition, we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products
and sales models that target developing countries. In this regard, we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth.

A
summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property, plant and equipment is set forth in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8,
which is incorporated herein by reference. Approximately 64% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2015 came from outside the United States ("U.S.").

For
a discussion of risks attendant to HP's international operations, see "Risk Factors—Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or
other factors could harm our business and financial performance," in Item 1A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk," in Item 7A and Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Research and Development

Innovation is a key element of our culture. Our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products, services and
solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires, and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique
contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences.

HP
Labs, together with the various research and development groups within our business segments, are responsible for our research and development efforts. HP Labs is part of our
Corporate Investments segment.

Expenditures
for research and development were $3.5 billion in fiscal 2015, $3.4 billion in fiscal 2014 and $3.1 billion in fiscal 2013. We anticipate that we will
continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products and services to maintain and enhance our
competitive position.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see "Risk Factors—If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy and continue to
develop, manufacture and market innovative products and services, our business and financial performance may suffer," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Patents

Our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or
where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At October 31, 2015, our worldwide patent portfolio included over
33,000 patents, which represents a slight decrease over the number of patents in our portfolio at the end of fiscal 2014. As a result of the Separation, approximately 15,000 patents were transferred
to Hewlett Packard Enterprise beginning November 1, 2015.



Patents
generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our
patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action
to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to HP as a
whole or to any of HP's business segments.

In
addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property ("IP") from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others
licenses, and other rights, under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to IP rights, see "Risk Factors—Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the intellectual
property rights on which our businesses depend," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio,
including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not
material to an understanding of our overall business.

Seasonality

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our
products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales are
often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market
anticipation of seasonal trends. See "Risk Factors—Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable," in
Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

We encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance,
price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security,
availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings.

The
markets for each of our business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly
growing firms. Most product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively
on the basis of the factors listed above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and often market their products under
their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust
prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.

We
have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing-related products and services, enterprise IT infrastructure products and
solutions,



multi-vendor
customer services and IT management software and solutions. We are the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments.

The
competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below:

Personal Systems.

The markets in which Personal Systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition. The
decline in
the PC market and the ongoing shift among customers to mobility products has further intensified competition in the PC market. Our primary competitors are Lenovo Group Limited ("Lenovo"),
Dell Inc. ("Dell"), Acer Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Apple Inc., Toshiba Corporation and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. ("Samsung"). In particular regions, we
also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or "white box" manufacturers. Our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio, our innovation and research
and development capabilities, our brand and procurement leverage, our ability to cross-sell our portfolio of offerings, our extensive service and support offerings and the accessibility of our
products through a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.

Printing.

The markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive. Printing's key customer segments each face
competitive
market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products. Our primary competitors include Canon U.S.A., Inc., Lexmark International, Inc., Xerox Corporation Ltd., Seiko
Epson Corporation, The Ricoh Company Ltd., Samsung and Brother Industries, Ltd. In addition, independent suppliers offer refill and remanufactured alternatives for HP original inkjet and
toner supplies, which are often available for lower prices but generally offer lower print quality and reliability. Other competitors also have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for
HP's laser and inkjet products, particularly outside of the U.S. where IP protection is inadequate or ineffective. Our competitive advantages include our comprehensive solutions for the home, office
and publishing environments, our innovation and research and development capabilities, our brand, and the accessibility of our products through a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and
commercial channels to direct sales.

Enterprise Group.

EG operates in the highly competitive enterprise technology infrastructure market that is characterized by rapid and
ongoing
technological innovation and price competition. Our primary competitors include technology vendors such as International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Dell, EMC Corporation ("EMC"), Cisco
Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), Lenovo, Oracle Corporation ("Oracle"), Fujitsu Limited ("Fujitsu"), Inspur Co. Ltd., Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., NetApp, Inc.,
Hitachi Ltd., Juniper Networks, Inc., Arista Networks, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., VMware, Microsoft, Google Inc.,
Rackspace Inc., and Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"). In certain regions, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or "white-box" manufacturers. Our
strategy is to deliver superior products, high-value technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure, software and services capabilities. Our
competitive advantages include our broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong IP portfolio and research and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner
ecosystem.

Enterprise Services.

ES competes in the IT services, consulting and integration, infrastructure technology outsourcing, business
process outsourcing
and application services markets. Our primary competitors include IBM Global Services, Computer Sciences Corporation, systems integration firms such as Accenture plc and offshore companies such
as Fujitsu and India-based competitors Wipro Limited, Infosys Limited and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. We also compete with other traditional hardware providers, such as Dell, which are
increasingly offering services to support their products, new players in emerging areas like cloud such as Amazon, and smaller local players. Many of our competitors offer a wide range of global
services, and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition. ES teams with many companies to offer services, and those arrangements allow us to



extend
our reach and augment our capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our deep technology expertise, especially in complex multi-country, multi-vendor and/or multi-language environments,
our differentiated intellectual property, our strong track record of collaboration with clients and partners, and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global
resources on platforms from SAP AG ("SAP"), Oracle and Microsoft, among others.

Software.

The markets in which our Software segment operates are characterized by rapidly changing customer requirements and
technologies. We design
and develop enterprise IT management software in competition with IBM, CA Technologies, Inc., VMware, BMC Software, Inc. and others. Our big data solutions, which include data analytics,
information governance and digital marketing offerings incorporating both structured and unstructured data, compete with products from companies like Adobe Systems Inc., IBM, EMC, Open Text
Corporation, Oracle and Symantec Corporation. We also deliver enterprise security/risk intelligence solutions that compete with products from EMC, IBM, Cisco and Intel. As customers are becoming
increasingly comfortable with newer delivery mechanisms such as SaaS, we are facing competition from smaller, less traditional competitors, particularly for customers with smaller IT organizations.
Our differentiation lies in the breadth and depth of our software, our collaboration with EG and ES to provide comprehensive IT solutions and services portfolio and the scope of our market coverage.

HP Financial Services.

In our financing business, our competitors are captive financing companies, mainly IBM Global Financing, as well
as banks and
other financial institutions in our financing business. We believe our competitive advantage in this business over banks and other financial institutions is our ability to deliver flexible investment
solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors, see "Risk Factors—We operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our
business and financial performance," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Environment

Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including
laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial
costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.

Many
of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use, including laws regulating the manufacture
and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. Some of our products also are, or may in the future be, subject to requirements
applicable to their energy consumption. In addition, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical
and materials composition of our products, their safe use, and their energy efficiency, including requirements relating to climate change. We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of
jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered
products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). In the event our products become non-compliant with these laws, our products could be restricted from entering certain
jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions, including fines.

Our
operations, and ultimately our products, are expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties relating to
climate change.



As
these laws, regulations, treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially face market access limitations
or other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we are collaborating
with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that HP technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws, regulations and
treaties.

We
are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of
our business. We meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services.

A
liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future
environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material
capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to these environmental factors, see "Risk Factors—Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and
regulations that could result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, for
a discussion of our environmental contingencies see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is also incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important for understanding any
statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this
Form 10-K.

Because
of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our results of operations, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and
historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

Risks related to our business

If we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, our business and results of operations
may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our business could be limited.

We are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. One set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating
market trends, such as the decline in the PC market, the growth of multi-architecture devices running competing operating systems and movement to continuous ink supply systems. A second set of
challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions; our business-specific
competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets; our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models; and our alliance
partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market execution. For example, we may fail to
develop innovative products and services, maintain the manufacturing quality of our products, manage our distribution network or successfully market new products and services, any of which could
adversely affect our business and financial condition.

In
addition, we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges, including weakness across many geographic regions, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe and Russia, and
certain countries and businesses in Asia. We may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to our efforts to address these challenges and higher than expected or unanticipated
execution costs. In addition, we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with our efforts to address these challenges given our large and diverse portfolio of businesses, the broad range of
geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate, and the ongoing integration of acquired businesses. If we do not succeed in these efforts, or if these efforts are more costly or
time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business.

We operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures could harm our business
and financial performance.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors have
targeted and are expected to continue targeting our key market segments. We compete primarily on the basis of our technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation,
distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support and security. If our products, services, support and cost
structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our results of operations and business prospects could be harmed.

We
have a large portfolio of products and must allocate our financial, personnel and other resources across all of our products while competing with companies that have smaller
portfolios or



specialize
in one or more of our product lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our business than our competitors do, and our competitors may have greater financial, technical and
marketing resources available to them compared to the resources allocated to our products and services that compete against their products.

Companies
with whom we have alliances in certain areas may be or become our competitors in other areas. In addition, companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form
alliances with our competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners, our business and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

We
face aggressive price competition and may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time trying to maintain or
improve our revenue and gross margin. In addition, competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete, or who can obtain better pricing, more favorable
contractual terms and conditions, or more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our cash
flows, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.

Industry
consolidation may also affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the markets in which we operate. Additionally, our
competitors may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with our existing or potential customers or suppliers.

Because
our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products, we may spend a proportionately greater amount of our revenues on research and development than some
of our competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure (apart from research and development expenses) on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross
margin and, therefore, our profitability could be adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other facets of our offerings are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction
to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which could adversely affect our financial performance and business prospects.

Even
if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, its financial performance could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment
or contains technology that is becoming obsolete. Financial performance could decline due to increased competition from other types of products. For example, growing demand for an increasing array of
mobile computing devices has reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products. In addition, refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of our LaserJet toner and inkjet cartridges compete
with our printing supplies business.

If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and
market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer.

Our strategy is focused on leveraging our existing portfolio of products, services and solutions to meet the demands of a continually
changing technological landscape and to offset certain areas of industry decline. To successfully execute this strategy, we must emphasize the aspects of our core business where demand remains strong,
identify and capitalize on natural areas of growth, and innovate and develop new products and services that will enable us to expand beyond our existing technology categories. Any failure to
successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.



The
process of developing new high-technology products, services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products, services and solutions is complex, costly and
uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share, results of operations and financial
condition. For example, to offset industry declines in some of our businesses, we must successfully grow in adjacencies such as copier printers, maintain our strong position in graphics and execute on
our strategy to grow commercial mobility by providing specialized products and services to address the needs of our customers. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain and protect
appropriate intellectual property, and commit significant research and development and other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products
and services. Any failure to accurately predict technological and business trends, control research and development costs or execute our innovation strategy could harm our business and financial
performance. Our research and development initiatives may not be successful in whole or in part, including research and development projects which we have prioritized with respect to funding and/or
personnel.

After
we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast
volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product's lifecycle or at all. Any delay in the development, production
or marketing of a new product, service or solution could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position.

If we cannot continue to produce quality products and services, our reputation, business and
financial performance may suffer.

In the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services,
including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products
and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or their employees. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and
suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. However, the products and services that we offer are complex, and our
regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errors, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third-parties.
If we are unable to determine the cause or find an appropriate solution to address quality issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which would delay revenue recognition and
receipt of customer payments and could adversely affect our revenue, cash flows and profitability. In addition, after products are delivered, quality issues may require us to repair or replace such
products. Addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, repair, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our financial performance. If new or existing
customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services, our results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our
customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect
our results of operations.

We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Currencies other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan (renminbi) and the Japanese yen, can have an
impact on our results as expressed in U.S. dollars. In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt obligations and the related European financial restructuring
efforts may cause the value of the euro to fluctuate.



Global
economic events and uncertainty may cause currencies to fluctuate and currency volatility contributes to variations in our sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. For example,
in the event that one or more European countries were to replace the euro with another currency, our sales into such countries, or into Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until
stable exchange rates are established. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, such as the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro or the weakness of the Japanese yen,
could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and
margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States.

From
time to time, we may use forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. The effectiveness of our hedges
depends on our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We
may incur significant losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility and currency variations. In addition, certain or all of our hedging activities may be ineffective, may
expire and not be renewed or may not offset any or more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our
revenue, financial condition and, to a lesser extent, our cost of sales.

Recent global, regional and local economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our
business and financial performance.

Our business and financial performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology products and
services in the markets in which we
compete. Recent economic weakness and uncertainty in various markets throughout the world have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and
in increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels. For example, we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions, particularly in the Europe, the
Middle East and Africa region, China and certain other high-growth markets. Ongoing U.S. federal government spending limits may continue to reduce demand for our products and services from
organizations that receive funding from the U.S. government, and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United States, which could further reduce demand for our products and services.
Economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products and services, may result in increased expenses due to higher allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and
asset impairment charges, and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross margin, cash flows and expenses.

We
also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross margin declines in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and
increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that, as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other
factors, we are unable to pass on to our customers. In addition, our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment, parts or components from our suppliers—and our
suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit.

Economic
weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any
significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of
market volatility and disruption. Poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher
pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on



changes
in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions
and associated expenses.

The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future
financial results less predictable.

Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our diverse products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore
will likely be different in future periods than our current results. Our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or reductions in hardware and related services
spending by our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenue. In addition,
revenue declines in some of our businesses may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are
dependent partially on the product, service, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. Competition, lawsuits, investigations, increases in component and manufacturing costs
that we are unable to pass on to our customers, component supply disruptions and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and
profitability. In addition, newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to our investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have
difficulty establishing and maintaining the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, competitive
pressures, commoditization of products, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins in a given period,
which may lead to adjustments to our operations. Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because the rate
at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period.

If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our business and
financial performance could suffer.

We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services around the world, including third-party resellers and
distributors and both direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential
customer segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous
balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability.

Our
financial results could be materially adversely affected due to distribution channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken. Our results of
operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various distribution channels or the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the loss of
retail shelf space. Moreover, some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including
economic weakness, industry consolidation and market trends. Many of our significant distributors operate on narrow margins and have been
negatively affected by business pressures in the past. Considerable trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel
partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience disruptions in distribution, if our distributors' financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or
operations weaken.



Our
inventory management is complex, as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors. We must manage both owned and channel inventory effectively, particularly
with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing challenges. Distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory
is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors and seasonal
fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce our visibility into demand and pricing trends and issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult. If
we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust
prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively.

We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our
suppliers effectively.

Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as well as our suppliers' ability
to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules for the delivery of our own products and services.
Given the wide variety of systems, products and services that we offer, the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world, and the long lead times required
to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems could arise in production, planning and inventory management that could seriously harm our business. In addition, our
ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our
suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us. Other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the terms of our contracts with
suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers, each of which is described below.

•

Component shortages.

We may experience a shortage of, or
a delay in receiving, certain components as a result of strong demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, the inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets, disputes
with suppliers (some of whom are also our customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new
suppliers. For example, our PC business relies heavily upon OMs to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those OMs to fulfill demand for our PC
products. We represent a substantial portion of the business of some of these OMs, and any changes to the nature or volume of our business transactions with a particular OM could adversely affect the
operations and financial condition of the OM and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that OM. If shortages or delays persist, the price of certain components may increase, we may be
exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide
services in a timely manner in the quantities needed or according to our specifications. Accordingly, our business and financial performance could suffer if we lose time-sensitive sales, incur
additional freight costs or are unable to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to reengineer some product or service offerings, which
could result in further costs and delays.

•

Excess supply.

In order to secure components for our
products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components strategically in advance of
demand to take advantage of



favorable
pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete
components, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.

•

Contractual terms.

As a result of binding long-term price
or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to
respond to changing market conditions. If we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have
access to components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence. In addition, many of our competitors obtain
products or components from the same OMs and suppliers that we utilize. Our competitors may obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, and more favorable
allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, and our ability to engage in relationships with certain OMs and suppliers could be limited. The practice employed by our
PC business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its OMs may create large supplier receivables with the OMs that, depending on the financial condition of
the OMs, may create collectability risks. In addition, certain of our OMs and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us. Any of these developments could adversely affect
our future results of operations and financial condition.

•

Contingent workers.

We also rely on third-party suppliers
for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims
relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent
workers. Our ability to manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.

•

Single-source suppliers.

We obtain a significant number
of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. For example, we rely on Canon for laser printer engines and laser toner cartridges. We also
rely on Intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our PCs and workstations, and we rely on AMD to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for other products.
Some of those processors are customized for our products. New products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is
a need for additional suppliers. Replacing a single-source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations.
For some components, such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from Intel, alternative sources either may not exist or may be unable to produce the quantities of those
components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single-source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and
other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single-source suppliers under those
agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of our components. The loss of a single-source supplier, the deterioration
of our relationship with a single-source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our
business and financial performance.



Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase
our costs and expenses.

Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, tsunamis, floods,
hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The
occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue, profitability and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position,
increase our costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development
activities are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. The
manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations. We also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in
Asia to manufacture and distribute our products, and primarily in the southwestern United States to import products into the Americas region. Our operations could be adversely affected if
manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, IT system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor,
environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near locations more vulnerable to the
occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions, such as near major earthquake faults, and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain.

Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial
results less predictable.

Our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occurs towards
the end of the quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of
unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than
orders, there may be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in each quarter and such orders may be
cancelled. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global
logistics disruptions could adversely impact our inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.

We
experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in our quarterly results and financial condition. For example, sales to governments
(particularly sales to the U.S. government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal year is the calendar year spend their remaining capital budget
authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year. Consumer sales are often higher in the fourth calendar quarter
compared to other quarters due in part to seasonal holiday demand. European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by
market anticipation of seasonal trends. Moreover, to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our
gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches. Typically, our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. Many of the factors that create and
affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.



Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors
could harm our business and financial performance.

Sales outside the United States made up approximately 64% of our net revenue for fiscal 2015. In addition, a portion of our business
activity is being conducted in emerging markets. Our future business and financial performance could suffer due to a variety of international factors,
including:

•

ongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest
rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;

•

longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers;

•

trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products, including policies adopted by
countries that may champion or otherwise favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors;

•

local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific suppliers and OEMs;

•

managing a geographically dispersed workforce;

•

changes in the international, national or local regulatory and legal environments;

•

differing technology standards or customer requirements;

•

import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could
increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for components,
increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;

•

difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws; and

•

fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation and
shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.

The
factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we rely on manufacturers in
Taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture.

In
many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, there are companies that engage in business practices prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us,
such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the "FCPA"). Although we implement policies, procedures and training designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees,
contractors and agents, as well as those of the companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if
prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.



Any failure by us to identify, manage and complete acquisitions, divestitures and other significant
transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.

As part of our business strategy, we may acquire companies or businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances
and joint ventures and make investments to further our business (collectively, "business combination and investment transactions"). Risks associated with business combination and investment
transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin, profitability and financial results:

•

Managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our
attention from other business operations.

•

We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction, and the
timeframe for realizing the benefits of a particular business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, advisors, suppliers, other third-parties or
market trends.

•

Certain prior business combination and investment transactions entered into by Hewlett-Packard Company resulted, and in the future any
such transactions by us may result, in significant costs and expenses, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges,
charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, asset impairment charges, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial
advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.

•

Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business combination and
investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable.

•

Our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and our ability to evaluate the
results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third-parties or their representatives.

•

The pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and
assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs, timing and other
matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated.

•

In order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for
our existing stockholders.

•

We may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions, and the amount and terms of any potential future
acquisition-related or other borrowings, as well as other factors, could affect our liquidity and financial condition.

•

Our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and business combination and investment transactions could adversely impact
our effective tax rate.

•

An announced business combination and investment transaction may not close on the expected timeframe or at all, which may cause our
financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter.

•

Business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation, which could impact our financial condition and results of
operations.



•

If we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our
strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage.

We
have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment
transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to
incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. If there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations
of our reporting units, we may incur additional charges, which may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges.

As
part of our business strategy, we regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our objectives. When we decide to sell assets
or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the achievement of our strategic objectives. We
may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. In addition, we may experience greater dis-synergies than expected, and the impact of the
divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. After reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business, we are subject to satisfaction of
pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the transaction.
Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations. Under these
arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results.

Integrating acquisitions may be difficult and time-consuming. Any failure by us to integrate
acquired companies, products or services into our overall business in a timely manner could harm our financial results, business and prospects.

In order to pursue our strategy successfully, we must identify candidates for and successfully complete business combination and
investment transactions, some of which may be large or complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired businesses, products, services or employees. Integration issues are
often time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business. The challenges involved in integration
include:

•

successfully combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are
developing expertise;

•

convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus;

•

persuading customers and distributors not to defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers (which could result in our
incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty), minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales, marketing and distribution efforts;

•

consolidating and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and
integrating software code and business processes;

•

minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;



•

persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, engaging with
employee works councils representing an acquired company's non-U.S. employees, integrating employees, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs;

•

coordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and
relationships with third-parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;

•

achieving savings from supply chain integration; and

•

managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.

We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of our restructuring plan and our
restructuring may adversely affect our business.

We announced a restructuring plan in September 2015 to realign our cost structure due to the changing nature of our business and to
achieve operating efficiencies that we expect to reduce costs. We may not be able to obtain the cost savings and benefits that were initially anticipated in connection with our restructuring.
Additionally, as a result of our restructuring, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and/or inefficiency during transitional periods. Reorganization and restructuring
can require a significant amount of management and other employees' time and focus, which may divert attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the
expected benefits of restructuring, it could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For more information about
our restructuring plan, including details regarding the plan announced in September 2015, see Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or enforce the
intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property laws in the United States, similar laws in
other countries, and agreements with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell, provide or
otherwise use in our operations. However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be
sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages, either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of
certain product offerings or other harm to our competitive position. For example, our enforcement of inkjet printer supplies IP against infringers may be successfully challenged or our IP may be
successfully circumvented. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be
unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our ability to sell products or services and our competitive
position.

Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third
parties

.

Some
of our business and some of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third-parties. We may not be able to obtain or continue to
obtain licenses and technologies from these third-parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third-parties may demand cross-licenses to our intellectual property. For example, some of our software
offerings are developed using software components or other intellectual property licensed from third parties, including through both proprietary and open source licenses. These third-party software
components may become obsolete,



defective
or incompatible with future versions of our products, or our relationship with the third party may deteriorate, or our agreements with the third party may expire or be terminated. We may
face legal or business disputes with licensors that may threaten or lead to the disruption of inbound licensing relationships. In order to remain in compliance with the terms of our licenses, we must
carefully monitor and manage our use of third-party software components, including both proprietary and open source license terms that may require the licensing or public disclosure of our
intellectual property without compensation or on undesirable terms. Additionally, some of these licenses may not be available to us in the future on terms that are acceptable or that allow our product
offerings to
remain competitive. Our inability to obtain licenses or rights on favorable terms could have a material effect on our business, including our financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third-parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain
restrictions that were not in place prior to such transaction. Because the availability and cost of licenses from third parties depends upon the willingness of third parties to deal with us on the
terms we request, there is a risk that third parties who license to our competitors will either refuse to license us at all, or refuse to license us on terms equally favorable to those granted to our
competitors. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit
these rights.

Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement are commonplace in the IT industry and
successful third-party claims may limit or disrupt our ability to sell our products and services.

Third-parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. For
example, patent assertion entities may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as
HP Inc. and our customers. If we cannot or do not license allegedly infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms, or if we are required to substitute similar technology from
another source, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend against and may
divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or
license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to
indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.

Further,
our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition, accrual and payment of
copyright levies or similar fees. In certain countries (primarily in Europe), proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving our company in which groups representing copyright owners have
sought or are seeking to impose upon and collect from HP Inc. levies upon equipment (such as PCs, MFDs and printers) alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws. Other such groups have
also sought to modify existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us. Other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to
extend existing levy schemes, and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices. The total amount of the copyright levies will
depend on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy, the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy, and the per unit fee for each type of product,
all of which are affected by several factors, including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable
countries, and could be substantial. Consequently, the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees, and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.



The allocation of intellectual property rights between Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company ("Hewlett
Packard Enterprise") and HP Inc. as part of the Separation, and the shared use of certain intellectual property rights following the Separation, could adversely impact our reputation, our
ability to enforce certain intellectual property rights that are important to us and our competitive position.

In connection with the Separation, Hewlett-Packard Company allocated to each of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. the
intellectual property assets relevant to their businesses. The terms of the Separation include cross-licenses and other arrangements to provide for certain ongoing use of intellectual property in the
existing operations of both businesses. For example, through a joint brand holding structure, both Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will retain the ability to make ongoing use of certain
variations of the legacy Hewlett-Packard and HP branding, respectively. There is a risk that the joint brand holding structure may impair the enforcement of HP Inc.'s trademark rights against third
parties that infringe them. Furthermore, as a result of this shared use of the legacy branding there is a risk that conduct or events adversely affecting the reputation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
could also adversely affect the reputation of HP Inc. In addition, as a result of the allocation of intellectual property as part of the Separation, HP Inc. will no longer have ownership
of intellectual property allocated to Hewlett Packard Enterprise and our resulting intellectual property ownership position could adversely affect our position and options relating to patent
enforcement, patent licensing and cross-licensing, our ability to sell our products or services, our competitive position in the industry and our ability to enter new product markets.

Our business and financial performance could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with
our services business properly.

The risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the
following:

•

The success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant services clients
and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients. We may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition, business failure, contract expiration or their selection of a competing
service provider or decision to in-source services. In addition, we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients. As a result of business downturns or for other
business reasons, we are also vulnerable to reduced business from our clients, which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services. We may not be able to replace the
revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services. In addition, our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience, and we may not be able to fully
recover our investments in such circumstances.

•

The pricing and other terms of some of our service agreements require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into
these contracts that could differ from actual results. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by
factors outside our control, could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on the profit margin of our services business.

•

Some of our service agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings
over the life of the agreement. These agreements may involve the development and deployment of new technologies. Varying degrees of performance risk exist in each agreement with these characteristics,
and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the development and deployment phases. Any failure to perform satisfactorily under these
agreements may expose us to legal liability, result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation, which could harm the financial performance of our services business.



•

If we do not hire, train, motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the right
geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients, our financial performance could suffer. For example, if our employee utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the level of
engagement of our employees could suffer. If that utilization rate is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed, as well as
our ability to staff projects. If we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand, we might need to redeploy existing personnel,
increase our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels, all of which could also negatively affect our profitability. In addition, if we have more employees than we need with
certain skill sets or in certain geographies, we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies.

Failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely
affect our business and results of operations.

Our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with
federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and
performance. Any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil
and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future
government contracting. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business. In addition, Hewlett-Packard Company has in the past been, and we may in the future be, subject to qui tam
litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government contracts, which could include claims for treble damages. Further, any negative publicity related to
our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy, may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. If our customer contracts are
terminated, if we are suspended or disbarred from government work, or if our ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, our financial performance could suffer.

Hewlett-Packard Company's stock price has historically fluctuated, and our stock price may continue
to fluctuate, which may make future prices of HP Inc.'s stock difficult to predict.

Our stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. Some of the factors that could affect our stock price
are:

•

speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about, or actual changes in, our business, strategic
position, market share, organizational structure, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost-cutting efforts, value or liquidity of our investments,
exposure to market volatility, prospects, business combination or investment transactions, future stock price performance, board of directors, executive team, our competitors or our industry in
general;

•

the announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions, divestitures or other
significant transactions by us or our competitors;

•

quarterly increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin, earnings or cash flows, changes in estimates by the investment community or
our financial outlook and variations between actual and estimated financial results;

•

announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by our competitors and other companies in the IT industry;



•

developments relating to pending investigations, claims and disputes; and

•

the timing and amount of our share repurchases.

General
or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to our performance also may
affect the price of our stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Additional volatility in the price of our securities could result in the filing of securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management
time and resources.

Failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position,
borrowing costs and access to capital markets.

Our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies. Fitch Ratings, Moody's Investor Service and Standard &
Poor's Rating Services downgraded Hewlett-Packard Company's ratings in the past. Past downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities, have reduced market capacity for our
commercial paper, and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any
additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may further impact us in a similar
manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.

We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial
Statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could adversely affect our results of operations.

In connection with the preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on
historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in the section entitled "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations" in Item 7 of this report. In addition, as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for
legal proceedings and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which
are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations.

Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to
additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.

We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by
the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may
disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in
order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we cannot assure you that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution
of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In
addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,
changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of



new
information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, if circumstances change such that we are unable to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings outside the United
States, future income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from historical amounts and could materially adversely affect our results of operations. The carrying value of deferred tax
assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, there are proposals for tax legislation that have
been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our deferred tax liabilities. Any of these
changes could affect our financial performance.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key
employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition qualified executives and other key
employees, including those in managerial, technical, development, sales, marketing and IT support positions. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified
executives, engineers, skilled solutions providers in the IT support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the IT
industry can be intense. In order to attract and retain executives and
other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and equity-based compensation. Our equity-based incentive awards may contain
conditions relating to our stock price performance and our long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such equity-based incentive
awards does not materialize, if our equity-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not
obtain the stockholder approval needed to continue granting equity-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain and motivate executives and key
employees could be weakened. Our failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. Further,
changes in our management team may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and
results of operations.

System security risks, data protection breaches, cyberattacks and systems integration issues could
disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.

Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our
confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other
malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and
applications that we produce or procure from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the
system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, including bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and other security vulnerabilities, could be
significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede
our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.

We
manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business and our customers. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental
loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data



about
us, our clients or our customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our
customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential
liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers'
system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures
could be significant.

Portions
of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes
place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and
resource intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers
resulting from these disruptions could reduce our revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts, wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and
revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts or wars (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to our business, our employees,
facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other
critical business operations. The potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other actual or potential conflicts
or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties. In addition, as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the United States, actions against
or by the United States may impact our business or employees. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, if they occur, they could result in a decrease in
demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our
supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.

Our business is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that could
result in costs or other sanctions that adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. For example, we are subject to laws and regulations
concerning environmental protection, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of
contaminated sites, the content of our
products and the recycling, treatment and disposal of our products, including batteries. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to
new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products, climate change laws and
regulations, and product take-back legislation. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws, we could incur
substantial costs or face other sanctions, which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions. Our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions,
third-party property damage, personal injury claims and clean-up costs. Further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed



retroactively,
on a joint and several basis, and without any finding of noncompliance or fault. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.

Some anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as
provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.

We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or
discouraging an acquisition of HP Inc. deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions:

•

authorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our
common stock;

•

limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;

•

specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in
accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;

•

requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of
candidates for election to our Board of Directors; and

•

controlling the procedures for conduct of our Board of Directors and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of our
directors.

These
provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or our management. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to
provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of
the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.

Any
provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of HP Inc. could limit the opportunity
for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock.

Risks Related to the Separation

The separation of Hewlett-Packard Company into two independent publicly-traded companies is subject
to various risks and uncertainties and may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.

On November 1, 2015, we completed the Separation of our enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing
businesses from its personal systems and printing businesses. The process of completing the Separation has involved significant costs and expenses. Uncertainty related to the Separation may lead
customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in our existing business relationships, or cause them to
consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. These disruptions could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and
prospects.

We
may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational, marketing or other benefits from the separation. As an independent publicly-traded company we are a
smaller, less diversified company with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could materially and adversely affect its business, financial condition
and results of operations.



The Separation could result in substantial tax liability.

We obtained an opinion of outside counsel that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Separation qualified, for both the company
and our stockholders, as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(d)(1)(D) and 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, we obtained a private letter ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Separation for the company and certain
related transactions as transactions that are generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The opinions of outside counsel and the IRS private letter ruling were based, among other things,
on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel and the IRS. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or
incomplete, reliance on the opinions and IRS private letter ruling may be affected. An opinion of outside counsel represents their legal judgement but is not binding on the IRS or any court.
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we
incurred certain tax costs in connection with the Separation, including non-U.S. tax expenses resulting from the Separation in multiple non-U.S. jurisdictions that do
not legally provide for tax-free Separation, which may be material. If the Separation or certain internal transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Separation are determined to be taxable for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, we, our stockholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax and/or Hewlett Packard Enterprise could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise or HP Inc. may fail to perform under the transaction agreements
executed as part of the Separation.

In connection with the Separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. entered into several agreements, including among
others a transition services agreement, a separation and distribution agreement, a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a real estate matters agreement, a commercial agreement and an
IT service agreement. The transition services agreement provides for the performance of certain services by each company for the benefit of the other for a transition period after the Separation. The
separation and distribution agreement, tax matters agreement, employee matters agreement and real estate matters agreement determine the allocation of assets and liabilities between the companies
following the Separation for those respective areas and include any necessary indemnifications related to liabilities and obligations. The commercial agreement establishes a bilateral relationship
between Hewlett Packard Enterprise and us for the purchase and sale of commercially available products and services for internal use, incorporation and bundling in OEM products and services, resale to
customers and use in the provision of managed services to customers, as well as joint customer pursuits and joint development activities. The IT service agreement provides for the performance by one
of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's subsidiaries of certain application development and maintenance and IT infrastructure services for us. We will rely on Hewlett Packard Enterprise to satisfy its
performance and payment obligations under these agreements. If Hewlett Packard Enterprise is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, we could incur operational difficulties or losses
that could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

On
July 21, 2011, HP's Board of Directors authorized a $10.0 billion share repurchase program. HP may choose to repurchase shares when sufficient liquidity exists and the
shares are trading at a discount relative to estimated intrinsic value. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private
transactions. All share repurchases settled in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 were open market transactions. As of October 31, 2015, HP had remaining authorization of $2.0 billion for
future share repurchases.

elsewhere in this document.

HP Separation Transaction

On November 1, 2015 (the "Distribution Date"), we completed the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Hewlett-Packard
Company's former enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses (the "Separation"). In connection with the Separation, Hewlett-Packard Company changed its name to
HP Inc.

On
November 1, 2015, each of our stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 21, 2015 (the "Record Date") received one share of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
common stock for every one share of our common stock held as of the Record Date. We distributed a total of approximately 1.8 billion shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock to our
stockholders.

Hewlett
Packard Enterprise is now an independent public company trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "HPE". After the Separation, we do not beneficially own
any shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock.

The
process of completing the Separation was highly complex and involved significant costs and expenses. Accordingly, we incurred separation costs and foreign tax expenses associated
with separating into two companies. In fiscal 2015, we recorded nonrecurring separation costs and net foreign tax expenses of $1.6 billion, which were primarily related to third-party
consulting, contractor fees and other incremental costs directly associated with the separation process. We expect total separation charges and net foreign tax expenses to be approximately
$180 million in fiscal 2016. Additionally, the separation into two independent companies is expected to result in total dis-synergies of approximately $400 million to $450 million annually,
which costs are primarily associated with corporate functions such as finance, legal, IT, real estate and human resources. Such dis-synergies are expected to be divided approximately equally between
HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.

We
recorded a deferred tax asset on these costs and expenses as they were incurred through fiscal 2015. We expect a portion of these deferred tax assets associated with separation costs
and expenses will be eliminated, given that some will be non-deductible, at the time the Separation is executed. Furthermore, we concluded on the legal form of the Separation and in May 2015 announced
that Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be the spinnee company in the United States ("U.S."). Accordingly, we implemented certain internal reorganizations of, and transactions among, our wholly-owned
subsidiaries and operating activities in preparation for the legal form of separation. As a result, we recognized gross incremental foreign tax expenses related to the separation of foreign legal
entities of approximately $300 million and foreign tax credits of approximately $100 million in fiscal 2015 with additional tax credit amounts expected over several years. As of
October 31, 2015, we also expect separation-related capital expenditures of approximately $30 million in fiscal 2016.

In
connection with the Separation, we and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as various other agreements that provide a
framework for the relationships between the parties going forward, including among others a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a transition service agreement, a real estate matters
agreement, a master commercial agreement and an information technology service agreement. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we transferred substantially all of the assets, liabilities and
operations of enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses to Hewlett Packard Enterprise in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2015.

The
historical results of operations and the financial position of Hewlett Packard Enterprise are included in the consolidated financial statements of HP Inc. for each of the
fiscal years included in this
report and will be reported as discontinued operations beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016. Beginning November 1, 2015, we no longer consolidate Hewlett Packard Enterprise within our
financial results or reflect the financial results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise within our continuing results of operations.

HP
consolidated net revenue declined 7.3% (decreased 2.1% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The leading contributors to the net revenue decline
were unfavorable currency impacts across all major segments, key account runoff and soft demand in Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing ("ITO") in ES, lower desktop sales in Personal Systems and
lower sales of printers and supplies. Partially offsetting these declines was growth within the EG segment from sales of ISS servers. Gross margin was 24.0% ($24.8 billion) and 23.9%
($26.6 billion) for fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. The 0.1 percentage point increase in gross margin was due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improvements in
underperforming contracts in ES. Partially offsetting the gross margin increase was the impact from a higher mix of ISS products in EG, competitive pricing pressures in Printing and the impact from
the sale of intellectual property ("IP") in the prior-year period. We continue to experience gross margin pressures resulting from a competitive pricing environment across our hardware portfolio. HP's
operating margin decreased by 1.1 percentage points in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to separation costs, pension plan settlement charges, data center impairments and the
impact from the sale of IP in the prior-year period. Partially offsetting these



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

declines
was the gross margin increase, lower selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses and lower restructuring charges.

As
of October 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments were $17.7 billion, representing an increase of approximately $2.2 billion
from the October 31, 2014 balance of $15.5 billion. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the following
factors: cash received from operating cash flows of $6.5 billion and cash received for net issuances and repayments of debt of $5.0 billion; partially offset by investments in property,
plant and equipment and business acquisitions net of divestitures of $3.2 billion and $2.4 billion, respectively, cash utilization for share repurchases of common stock of
$2.9 billion and dividend payments to stockholders of $1.2 billion.

We
continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations. One set of challenges relates to dynamic
and accelerating market trends such as the decline in the PC market. Certain of our legacy hardware businesses face challenges as customers migrate to cloud-based offerings and reduce their purchases
of hardware products. A second set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and
solutions, our business-specific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and
business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market
execution.

The
macroeconomic weakness we have experienced has moderated in some geographic regions but remains an overall challenge. A discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is
set forth below.

•

In Personal Systems, we are witnessing soft demand in the Personal Computer ("PC") market as customers hold onto their PCs longer,
thereby extending PC refresh cycles. Demand for PCs is being impacted by weaker macroeconomic conditions and currency devaluations in certain Asian and European markets. Additionally, industry wide,
PC channels in some regions are working through excess channel inventory, which is impacting sell in. As such, we see continued market headwinds for the next several quarters. However, we are
optimistic and see opportunity in the market long term given our strength in Commercial and the launch of Windows 10, combined with Intel's Skylake processor family transition, which may represent a
catalyst for demand through introduction of breakthrough form factors. In Personal Systems, we are maintaining our strategic focus on profitable growth through improved market segmentation with
respect to enhanced innovation in multi-operating systems, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes. Additionally, HP is investing significantly in premium and
mobility form factors such as convertible notebooks, detachable notebooks, and commercial tablets in order to meet customer preference for mobile, thinner and lighter devices.

•

In Printing, we are experiencing the impact of the growth in mobility and demand challenges in consumer and commercial markets. We are
also experiencing an overall competitive pricing environment due to aggressive pricing from our Japanese competitors, given the weakness of the Japanese yen. To be successful in addressing these
challenges, we need to continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted at high usage categories and introducing new revenue delivery models to consumer customers. In the
consumer market, our Ink in the Office products are driving unit volume due to our OfficeJet Pro product lines. The Ink in the Office



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

initiative
also targets shifting ink into SMBs through our OfficeJet Pro X printers which leverage our Page-Wide Array technology. In the commercial market, our focus is on placing higher value
printer units which also offers a positive annuity of toner and ink and accelerating growth in graphics. We are accomplishing this in several growth areas: in multi-function and Enterprise Ink
printers with recently introduced products that are increasing demand, in managed print services, which presents a strong after-market supplies opportunity, and in graphics with product innovation
such as our Indigo product
line. We plan to continue this focus on shifting the mix in the installed base to more value-added units, and expanding our innovative ink, laser and graphics programs.

•

In EG, we are experiencing challenges due to multiple market trends, including the increasing demand for hyperscale computing
infrastructure products, the transition to cloud computing and a highly competitive pricing environment. In addition, demand for our Business Critical Systems ("BCS") products continues to weaken as
has the overall market for UNIX products. The effect of lower BCS and traditional storage revenue along with a higher mix of ISS density optimized server products and midrange Converged Storage
solutions is impacting support attach opportunities in Technology Services ("TS"). To be successful in overcoming these challenges, we must address business model shifts and go-to-market execution
challenges, while continuing to pursue new product innovation that builds on our existing capabilities in areas such as cloud and data center computing, software-defined networking, storage, blade
servers and wireless networking.

•

In ES, we are facing challenges, including managing the revenue runoff from several large contracts, pressured public sector spending,
a competitive pricing environment and market pressures from a mixed economic recovery in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"). We are also experiencing commoditization in the IT infrastructure
services market that is placing pressure on traditional ITO pricing and cost structures. There is also an industry-wide shift to highly automated, asset-light delivery of IT infrastructure and
applications leading to headcount consolidation. To be successful in addressing these challenges, we must execute on the ES multi-year turnaround plan, which includes a cost reduction initiative to
align our costs to our revenue trajectory, a focus on new logo wins and Strategic Enterprise Services ("SES") and initiatives to improve execution in sales performance and accountability, contracting
practices and pricing.

•

In Software, we are facing challenges, including the market shift to SaaS and go-to-market execution challenges. To be successful in
addressing these challenges, we must improve our go-to-market execution with multiple product delivery models which better address customer needs and achieve broader integration across our overall
product portfolio as we work to capitalize on important market opportunities in cloud, big data and security.

To
address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with market demand, industry trends and the needs of our
customers and partners. In addition, we need to continue to improve our operations, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes and efficiencies. We also need to continue to optimize
our sales coverage models, align our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improve channel execution,
strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, and develop and capitalize on market opportunities.

incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

General

The Consolidated Financial Statements of HP are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"),
which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates
with the Audit Committee of HP's Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these
estimates. Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these
estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

A
summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. An
accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different
estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial
statements. Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price
or fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured, as well as when other revenue recognition principles are met, including industry-specific revenue recognition guidance.

We
enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements we enter into which contain
non-standard terms and conditions. Further, many of our arrangements include multiple elements. As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate
accounting, including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting, the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of
revenue recognition for each of those elements.

We
recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, we
recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the undelivered elements. If the arrangement includes a customer-negotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items
and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In arrangements
with



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

combined
units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price among elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue
recognized for the contract.

We
establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price, if available, third-party evidence ("TPE"), if VSOE of
selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP"), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable
when sold separately and, in
rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or
services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. ESP is established based on management's judgment considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls,
customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology life cycles. We may
modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting both VSOE of selling price and ESP. In most arrangements with multiple elements,
the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price. However, the aforementioned factors may result in a
different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods. This may change the pattern and timing of revenue recognition for
identical arrangements executed in future periods, but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement.

We
reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns.
Future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the
incentive is offered. For certain incentive programs, we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the
incentive.

For
hardware products, we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners (including resellers, distributors and value-added
solution providers) when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. For indirect sales to channel partners, we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic
substance apart from HP and HP has completed its obligations related to the sale.

For
the various software products we sell (e.g., big data analytics and applications, application delivery management, enterprise security and IT Operations Management), we assess
whether the software products were sold on a standalone basis or with hardware products. If the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware product and
is more-than-incidental, we treat it as a software deliverable.

We
recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term, assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Term-based software
license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license. We use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when VSOE of fair
value for all undelivered elements, such as post-contract customer support, exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or
updates provided



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

on
a when-and-if-available basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered.

For
hosting or SaaS arrangements, we recognize revenue as the service is delivered, generally on a straight-line basis, over the contractual period of performance. In hosting
arrangements, we consider the rights provided to the customer (e.g. whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period
without significant penalty and the feasibility of the customer to operate or contract with another vendor to operate the software) in determining whether the arrangement includes the sale of a
software license. In hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold, license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold, when all other revenue
recognition criteria are satisfied.

We
recognize revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software post-contract customer support agreements, ratably over the
contract period. For certain fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements, we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method. We estimate the total expected
labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date. We apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various
stages of a contract can be made. On fixed-price contracts for design and build projects (to design, develop and construct software infrastructure and systems), we recognize revenue as work progresses
using the percentage-of-completion method. We use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of costs incurred to date compared to the total
estimated costs of the project. Total project costs are subject to revision throughout the life of a fixed-price contract. Provisions for estimated losses on fixed-price contracts are recognized in
the period when such losses become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales. In circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize
revenue using the completed contract method.

Outsourcing
services revenue is generally recognized in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event. We
recognize revenue using an objective measure of output for per unit-priced contracts. Revenue for fixed-price outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straight-line basis if the
service is provided evenly over the contract term. Provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable and are
recorded as a component of cost of sales.

Warranty

We accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a product
group basis. Our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. While we engage in
extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty
terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline
experience. Warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts and labor, depending upon the product. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense and actual
warranty costs have averaged approximately 2.5% and 2.7% of annual net product revenue, respectively.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Restructuring

We have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee
separation costs for workforce reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs. We
accrue for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining
severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. For a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions of restructuring in
"Results of Operations" below and in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefits

Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions. Our major assumptions relate
primarily to discount rates, mortality
rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. The discount rate assumption is based on current investment yields of high-quality fixed-income
securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a historical demographic study of the
plan. The expected increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future expectations. The expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on
asset allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually including
reviewing current capital market assumptions to assess the reasonableness of the expected long-term return on plan assets. We update the expected long-term return on assets when we observe a
sufficient level of evidence that would suggest the long-term expected return has changed. In any fiscal year, significant differences may arise between the actual return and the expected long-term
return on plan assets. Historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or actual asset allocation, short-term
performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit payments compared to expectations,
and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures. For the recognition of net periodic benefit cost, the calculation of the
expected long-term return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year unless updated as result of interim remeasurement.

Our
major assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated
herein by reference. The following table provides the impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions of discount rates, the

Taxes on Earnings

We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions
reflected in our income tax returns. We adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal
year.

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.

We
record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider
future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to
determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a
corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the
deferred tax assets, we would reverse
the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions
in which the deferred tax assets are located.

Our
effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings
indefinitely outside the U.S. We plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long-term investment requirements of our foreign
subsidiaries and our domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the U.S. and the amounts we expect to distribute to the U.S. and
provide the U.S. federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the U.S. Further, as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from
manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and, in some cases, is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2026. Material changes in our estimates of
cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the U.S., and our related future
effective tax rate.

We
are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 105 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe
that positions



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

taken
on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our
income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the
related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax
provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties
concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest. For a further discussion
on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Inventory

We state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of
inventory to its net realizable value at the
product group level for estimated excess or obsolescence. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, technological changes, product life cycle and development plans, component
cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues.

Business Combinations

We allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, including in-process research and development ("IPR&D"),
liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset
with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated
useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, we will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to the Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period it is abandoned. The excess
of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquiree is recorded as goodwill.

When
determining the fair values of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquiree, management makes significant estimates and assumptions,
especially with respect to intangible assets. Critical estimates in valuing intangible assets include, but are not limited to, expected future cash flows, which includes consideration of future growth
rates and margins, attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates. Fair value estimates are based on the assumptions management believes a
market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. Amounts recorded in a business combination may change during the measurement period, which is a period not to exceed one year from the
date of acquisition, as additional information about conditions existing at the acquisition date becomes available.

Goodwill

We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may
not be recoverable. While we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, for our annual goodwill
impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the

unit level. As of October 31, 2015, our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, except for ES, which includes two reporting units:
MphasiS Limited; and the remainder of ES.

In
the first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a
weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit
based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry
and market conditions. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty
related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from
comparable publicly-traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. We weight the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of
comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the
income approach. For the MphasiS Limited reporting unit, we utilized the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value.

In
order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of our reporting units, we compare the aggregate reporting unit fair value to HP's market capitalization and calculate
an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units' fair value over HP's market capitalization). We evaluate the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums
from recent comparable transactions. If the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in light of these recent transactions, we reevaluate reporting unit fair values, which may result
in an adjustment to the discount rate and/or other assumptions. This reevaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all of our reporting units.

Estimating
the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue
growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable
publicly-traded companies. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each
reporting unit.

If
the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step,
the reporting unit's assets, including any unrecognized intangible assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests are
measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business
combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying amount, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.

Our
annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, did not result in any impairment charges. The excess of fair value
over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from 19% to approximately 2,600% of carrying amounts. The Software reporting unit has the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount at 19%.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to
the fair value of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranging from 7% to approximately 2,400% of the
carrying amounts with the Software reporting unit having the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount of 7%. The fair value of the Software reporting unit is estimated using equal weighting of
both the income and market approaches. Our Software business is facing multiple challenges including the market shift to SaaS and go-to-market execution challenges. If we are not successful in
addressing these challenges, our projected revenue growth rates could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the Software reporting unit. The fair value of the Software reporting unit
could also be negatively impacted by declines in market multiples of revenue for comparable publicly-traded companies, changes in management's business strategy or significant and sustained declines
in our stock price, which could result in an indicator of impairment.

Intangible Assets

We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual
disposition of the asset. If the
undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the finite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is measured as the
difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. We estimate the fair value of finite-lived intangible assets by using an income approach or, when available and appropriate,
using a market approach.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates. We use forwards, swaps and at times, options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes. As of
October 31, 2015, the gross notional of our derivative portfolio was $52.6 billion. Assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value, and were
$1.1 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively as of October 31, 2015.

Fair
value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In the absence of
active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is
consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about
assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those
differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued. We generally use industry
standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions. When prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability, we use industry standard
valuation models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based

observable
inputs, including interest rate curves, HP and counterparty credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices.

For
a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to Note 11 and Note 12, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Loss Contingencies

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of IP, commercial, securities,
employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. We
review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events,
pertaining to a particular case. Based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in Note 16 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, are not a meaningful indicator of HP's potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable.
However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by
the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2015, it was not reasonably possible that a
material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements see Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our
overall net revenue. As a result, our net revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a
framework for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year percentage change in net revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no
change in foreign currency exchange rates
from the prior-year period and doesn't adjust for any repricing or demand impacts from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This information is provided so that net revenue can be viewed
without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is consistent with how management evaluates our net revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is
provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently,
which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

For fiscal 2015, total net revenue decreased 7.3 percentage points. From a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing
to the change in net revenue are summarized as follows:

•

Personal Systems net revenue decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, particularly in EMEA, and weakening market
demand;

•

ES net revenue decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, revenue runoff in key accounts and weak growth in new and
existing accounts;

•

Printing net revenue decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, weak market demand and competitive pricing pressures;

•

HPFS net revenue decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts led by weakness in the euro and lower asset management
activity primarily in customer buyouts;

•

Corporate Investments net revenue decreased due to the sale of IP in the prior-year period;

•

Software net revenue decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and declines in license revenue; and

•

EG net revenue increased due to growth in Industry Standard Servers ("ISS") and net revenue resulting from our acquisition of Aruba
Networks, Inc. ("Aruba") in May 2015.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

For fiscal 2014, total net revenue decreased 0.8 percentage points. From a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing
to the change in net revenue are summarized as follows:

•

ES net revenue declined due primarily to revenue runoff in key accounts, weak growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in
EMEA, and contractual price declines;

•

Printing net revenue decreased due primarily to a decline in Supplies;

•

EG net revenue decreased due to net revenue declines in TS, BCS and Storage;



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

•

Software net revenue decreased due to lower net revenue from licenses, support and professional services;

•

HPFS net revenue decreased due primarily to lower portfolio revenue from lower average portfolio assets and lower asset management
activity, primarily in customer buyouts;

•

Corporate Investments net revenue increased due to the sale of IP; and

•

Personal Systems net revenue increased due to growth in commercial PCs, particularly notebooks, along with growth in consumer
notebooks.

A
more detailed discussion of segment revenue is included under "Segment Information" below.

Gross Margin

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

HP's gross margin increased by 0.1 percentage points for fiscal year 2015 compared with fiscal 2014. From a segment perspective,
the primary factors impacting gross margin performance are summarized as follows:

•

ES gross margin increased due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improving profit performance in underperforming
contracts;

•

HPFS gross margin decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, lower margin in customer buyouts, and lower portfolio
margin due to competitive pricing;

•

EG gross margin decreased due primarily to a higher revenue mix of ISS products, unfavorable currency impacts, and competitive
pricing;

•

Printing gross margin decreased due primarily to a competitive pricing environment in hardware and unfavorable currency impacts;

•

Personal Systems gross margin decreased due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and a lower mix of commercial products,
partially offset by favorable component costs and operational cost improvements; and

•

Software gross margin decreased due to a lower mix of license revenue.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

HP's gross margin increased by 0.8 percentage points for fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal 2013. From a segment perspective,
the primary factors impacting gross margin performance are summarized as follows:

•

ES gross margin increased due primarily to our continued focus on service delivery efficiencies, improving profit performance in
under-performing contracts and labor savings as a result of restructuring;

•

Printing gross margin increased due primarily to favorable currency impacts from the Japanese yen, continued cost structure
improvements and a favorable mix from a higher proportion of graphics and ink supplies;

•

Corporate Investments gross margin increased due to the sale of IP;



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

•

Software gross margin increased due to the shift to more profitable contracts and improved workforce utilization in professional
services;

•

HPFS gross margin increased due to a higher portfolio margin, primarily from lower bad debt expense, a lower cost of funds and
improved margins in remarketing sales;

•

Personal Systems gross margin increased due primarily to operational cost improvements, a favorable mix of commercial products and the
sale of IP; and

•

EG gross margin decreased due primarily to the impact of a higher mix of ISS products, lower mix of BCS products and competitive
pricing pressure in ISS and Networking.

A
more detailed discussion of segment gross margins and operating margins is included under "Segment Information" below.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

R&D
expense increased 2% in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to expenses from the acquisition of Aruba and increases in Technology
Services, cloud and HP Labs, partially offset by favorable currency impacts.

R&D
expense increased 10% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 with increases across each of our segments as we made investments in our strategic focus areas of cloud, security, big
data and mobility.

Selling, General and Administrative

SG&A
expense decreased 9% in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 due primarily to favorable currency impacts and declines in go-to-market costs as a result
of lower commissions and productivity initiatives.

SG&A
expense increased 1% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to higher compensation costs, litigation expenses and higher selling costs from investments in the areas
of cloud, networking and storage, partially offset by gains from sales of real estate and lower program spending in marketing.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization
expense decreased in fiscal 2015 and in fiscal 2014 due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end
of their respective amortization periods, partially offset by amortization expense from intangible assets resulting from the acquisition of Aruba in fiscal 2015.

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring
charges decreased 37% in fiscal 2015 due primarily to lower charges from the multi-year restructuring plan initially announced in May 2012 (the
"2012 Plan").

On
September 14, 2015, our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the "2015 Plan") in connection with the Separation which will be implemented through fiscal 2018. As a
result, HP recognized $391 million of charges related to the 2015 Plan during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Restructuring
charges increased in fiscal 2014 due primarily to higher charges in connection with the 2012 Plan and from increases to the 2012 Plan announced in fiscal 2014. During
fiscal 2014, HP increased the total for positions expected to be eliminated under the 2012 Plan from 34,000 to 55,000 positions. In fiscal 2015, HP recognized restructuring charges of $640 million in
connection with the 2012 Plan.

Acquisition and Other Related Charges

Acquisition
and other related charges increased for fiscal 2015, due primarily to the acquisition of Aruba resulting in a non-cash inventory fair value
adjustment charge and professional services and legal fees associated with the acquisition.

Separation Costs

Separation
costs for fiscal 2015 were primarily comprised of third-party consulting, contractor fees and other related costs.

Defined Benefit Plan Settlement Charges

Defined
benefit plan settlement charges for fiscal 2015 were related to U.S. defined benefit plan settlement expense and net periodic benefit cost resulting
from the voluntary lump sum program announced in January 2015.

Impairment of Data Center Assets

Impairment
of data center assets for fiscal 2015 was related to our exit from several ES data centers.

Interest and Other, Net

Interest and other, net expense increased by $111 million in fiscal 2015. The increase was in connection with
$167 million of early debt settlement costs and higher foreign currency transaction losses, partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower weighted average interest rates and a
decrease in miscellaneous other expenses.

Interest
and other, net expense increased by $7 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was due primarily to higher currency transaction losses partially offset by lower interest
expense from a lower average debt balance.

Provision for Taxes

Our effective tax rates were 3.8%, 23.5% and 21.5% in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally
differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The jurisdictions
with favorable tax rates that had the most significant impact on HP's effective tax rate in the periods presented were Puerto Rico, Singapore, China, Malaysia, Ireland and Netherlands. HP plans to
reinvest certain earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the U.S. and therefore has not provided U.S. taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

For
a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our provision for taxes, see Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

In
fiscal 2015, we recorded $1.6 billion of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. These amounts included $1.8 billion tax benefit due to a release of
valuation allowances pertaining to certain U.S. deferred tax assets and $486 million tax charge to record valuation allowances on certain
foreign deferred tax assets, both related to legal entities within the ES business, $394 million of tax charges for adjustments to uncertain tax positions and the settlement of tax audit
matters, inclusive of $449 million of tax charges related to pension transfers, and $3 million of tax charges for various provision to return adjustments and other adjustments. In
addition, we recorded $639 million of net tax benefits on restructuring, separation-related and other charges and a tax benefit of $47 million arising from the retroactive research and development
credit resulting from the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014, which was signed into law in December 2014.

We
recorded gross deferred tax assets of $12.5 billion, $14.0 billion and $13.6 billion at October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 which were reduced by valuation allowances
of $9.9 billion, $11.9 billion and $11.4 billion respectively. Total valuation allowances decreased by $2 billion in fiscal 2015 associated with the release of a valuation allowance against deferred
tax assets in the U.S., and increased by $525 million in fiscal 2014, associated primarily with foreign net operating losses.

In
fiscal 2014, we recorded $53 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year.

In
fiscal 2013, we recorded $471 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year. These amounts included $214 million of net increases to valuation
allowances, $406 million of tax charges for adjustments to uncertain tax positions and the settlement of tax audit matters and $47 million of tax charges for various prior period
adjustments. In addition, we recorded $146 million of tax benefits from adjustments to prior year foreign income tax accruals and a tax benefit of $50 million arising from the
retroactive research and development credit resulting from the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law in January 2013.

Segment Information

A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.

Effective
at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2015, we implemented an organizational change to align our segment financial reporting more closely with its current business
structure. This organizational change resulted in the transfer of third-party multi-vendor support arrangements from the TS business unit within the EG segment to the ITO business unit within the ES
segment. We have reflected this change to our segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which has resulted in the removal of intersegment revenue from the TS business unit
within the EG segment and the related corporate intersegment revenue eliminations, and the transfer of operating profit from the TS business unit within the EG segment to the ITO business unit within
the ES segment.

In
connection with the Separation, effective at the beginning of its fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we implemented an organizational change which resulted in the transfer of marketing
optimization solutions business from the Software segment to the Commercial Hardware business unit within the

Printing
segment. We have reflected this change to our segment information in prior reporting periods on an as-if basis, which resulted in the transfer of net revenue from the Software segment to the
Commercial Hardware business unit within the Printing segment. This change also resulted in the transfer of operating profit from the Software segment to the Commercial Hardware business unit within
the Printing segment. In addition, this change resulted in the reclassification of $512 million of goodwill from the Software segment to the Printing segment.

These
changes had no impact on our previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share.

HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

Personal Systems net revenue decreased 8.3% (decreased 3.1% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2015. The net revenue decline in
Personal Systems was due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, particularly in EMEA, and weakening market demand. Personal Systems net revenue decreased as a result of a 5% decline in average
selling prices ("ASPs") and a 3% decline in unit volume. The decline in ASPs was due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, a shift in consumer PCs to low end products and a lower mix of
commercial PCs within Personal Systems. The unit volume decline was due primarily to a unit volume decline in desktops, partially offset by a unit volume growth in notebooks, both consumer and
commercial.

Net
revenue for commercial clients decreased 8% due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, a decline in commercial desktops as a result of weak market demand and higher net revenue
in the prior-year period resulting from the replacement of the Windows XP operating system. Net revenue for consumer clients decreased 8% due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and a decline in
consumer desktops. Net revenue declined 17% in Desktop PCs, 2% in Notebook PCs, 9% in Workstations and 8% in Other. The net revenue decline in Other was due primarily to a decline in consumer tablets,
the sale of IP in the prior-year period, and unfavorable currency impacts, the effects of which were partially offset by increased sales of extended warranties.

Personal
Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.3 percentage points for fiscal 2015 as a result of a decline in gross margin combined with
an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decline in gross margin was due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and a lower mix of commercial products, partially offset
by favorable component costs and operational cost improvements. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased due primarily to the size of the net revenue decline, higher administrative
expenses as a result of lower bad debt recoveries as compared to the prior-year period and higher R&D investments in commercial, mobility and immersive computing products, the effects of which were
partially offset by a decline in field selling costs as a result of favorable currency impacts and operational cost improvements.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

Personal Systems net revenue increased 6.6% (increased 7.2% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. While the Personal Systems
business continued to be challenged by the market shift towards mobility products, the pace of the PC market decline slowed with signs of stabilization driven by growth in commercial PCs, the effects
of which were partially offset by weakness in consumer PCs. The revenue increase in Personal Systems was due to growth in commercial PCs, particularly notebooks, along with growth in consumer
notebooks. Personal Systems experienced revenue growth across all regions led by double digit revenue growth in EMEA, which experienced improved demand. The revenue increase was driven by an 8.2%
increase in unit volume, the effects of which were partially offset by a 1.5% decline in ASPs. The unit volume increase was primarily led by growth in commercial notebooks as well as strength in
commercial desktops, consumer notebooks and thin client products. The decline in ASPs was due primarily to a competitive pricing environment and unfavorable currency impacts, the effects of which were
partially offset by a favorable mix of commercial PCs.

Net
revenue for commercial clients increased 10% due primarily to the benefits from the delayed installed base refresh cycle, the effects of customers migrating from the Windows XP
operating system and growth in all product categories partly driven by new product introductions, including the HP Elite

products.
Net revenue for consumer clients remained flat as growth in consumer notebooks, partly driven by our new product lineup including Chromebooks and hybrid products, was offset by a decline in
consumer desktops. For fiscal 2014, net revenue for Notebook PCs increased 9%, Desktop PCs increased 3%, Workstations increased 3% and Other net revenue increased 16%. The net revenue increase in
Other was due to the sale of IP and growth in mobility products, primarily consumer tablets which were introduced in the second half of fiscal 2013.

Personal
Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 0.7 percentage points for fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by an increase in gross margin
and a decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to operational cost improvements, a favorable commercial mix and the sale of IP, the
effects of which were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased due primarily to our cost structure optimization efforts, the
effects of which were partially offset by increased research and development investments for commercial, mobility and immersive computing products, as well as higher administrative expenses driven by
lower bad debt recoveries as compared to fiscal 2013.

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

Printing net revenue decreased 8.5% (decreased 5.1% on a constant currency basis) for fiscal 2015. The decline in net revenue was due
primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, decline in Supplies, weak market demand and competitive pricing pressures, the effects of which were partially offset by growth in graphics products. From a
regional perspective, Printing experienced a net revenue decline across all regions, primarily in EMEA and particularly in Russia as a result of challenges in those markets.

Net
revenue for Supplies decreased 6% due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and demand weakness in toner and ink, partially offset by growth in graphics supplies. The demand
weakness in toner was particularly in EMEA, led by a net revenue decline in Russia. Printer unit volumes declined 7% while average revenue per unit ("ARU") decreased 7%. Printer unit volume declined
due primarily to a decline in LaserJet and home printer units, the effects of which were partially offset by growth in graphics printer units. The ARU for printers decreased due primarily to a highly
competitive pricing environment and unfavorable currency impacts on Inkjet and LaserJet printers. Net revenue for Commercial Hardware decreased 10% driven by a 7% decline in printer unit volume and a
4% decline in ARU, partially offset by a net revenue increase in other peripheral solutions. In Commercial Hardware, the decline in unit volume was due primarily to an overall decline in LaserJet
printer units, partially offset by growth in graphics printer units. The ARU decline in Commercial Hardware was due primarily to a competitive pricing environment and unfavorable currency impacts. Net
revenue for Consumer Hardware decreased 20% driven by a 13% decline in ARU and a 7% decline in unit volume. The ARU decline in Consumer Hardware was due primarily to a competitive pricing
environment and unfavorable currency impacts. The unit volume decline in Consumer Hardware was due primarily to lower sales of home and SMB printer units.

Printing
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue remained flat for fiscal 2015 due to a decline in gross margin, offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenue. The decline in gross margin was due primarily to a competitive pricing environment in hardware and unfavorable currency impacts, the effects of which were partially offset by a favorable mix
of ink and graphics supplies and favorable currency impacts from the Japanese yen. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased due primarily to our cost saving initiatives, lower
marketing expenses, the impact of the divestiture of our photo printing service Snapfish and favorable currency impacts.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

In fiscal 2014, Printing experienced a decline in revenue and an increase in operating profit as we continued to push our print
strategies, which includes driving high value printer unit placements and expanding our graphics products and managed print services portfolio. Printing net revenue decreased 3.8% (decreased 3.3% on a
constant currency basis) for fiscal 2014. The decline in net revenue was primarily driven by a decline in Supplies, the effects of which were partially offset by growth in graphics products and
managed print services.

Net
revenue for Supplies decreased 5% driven by demand weakness in toner and ink, and a reduction in channel inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the effects of which were
partially offset by growth in graphics supplies. Printer unit volume remained flat while ARU decreased 1%. Printer unit volume was flat due primarily to our continued efforts to target high value
areas of the market, which resulted in a decline in home printer units and low value LaserJet printer units, the effects of which were offset by increased units in SMB, multifunction laser and
graphics printers. The decline in ARU was due primarily to increased discounting driven by competitive pricing pressures. Net revenue for Commercial Hardware was flat as a 3% increase in printer unit
volume was offset by a 3% decline in printer ARU. The unit volume in Commercial Hardware increased due primarily to growth in our multifunction laser printers and graphics printers. The ARU decline in
Commercial Hardware was due primarily to a decline in LaserJet and graphics printers driven by a competitive pricing environment. Net revenue for Consumer Hardware decreased 4% driven by a 1% decline
in printer unit volume and a 1% decline in ARU, along with a decline in other peripheral printing solutions. The unit volume decline in Consumer Hardware was due to lower sales of home printers, the
effects of which were partially offset by growth in SMB printers. The ARU decline in Consumer Hardware was due primarily
to increased discounting for SMB printers due to a competitive pricing environment, the effects of which were partially offset by a favorable mix of high value home printers.

Printing
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.8 percentage points for fiscal 2014 as an increase in gross margin more than offset an increase in
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin increase was due to favorable currency impacts primarily driven by the Japanese yen, continued cost structure improvements and a
favorable mix from a higher proportion of graphics and ink supplies, the effects of which were partially offset by a competitive pricing environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue
increased due primarily to higher R&D expenses as a result of our investments in enterprise products and 3-D printing, the effects of which were partially offset by reduced marketing expenses.

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

EG net revenue increased 0.7% (increased 6.3% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2015. The increase in EG net revenue was due
primarily to growth in ISS and from our acquisition of Aruba in May 2015, partially offset primarily by unfavorable currency impacts led by the euro and a net revenue decline in TS. However, we
continued to experience challenges due to market trends, including the transition to cloud computing, as well as product and technology transitions, along with a highly competitive pricing
environment.

ISS
net revenue increased 8% as a result of higher average unit prices ("AUPs) and unit volume growth. The increase in AUP's was across the server portfolio, primarily driven by higher
option attach rates for memory, processors and hard drives and a mix shift to high-end new generation HP ProLiant servers. The unit volume growth was primarily due to shipment increases in rack and
density optimized server products. Networking net revenue increased 8% due primarily to revenue from Aruba, which
resulted in higher revenue from wireless local area network ("WLAN") products, the effect of which was partially offset by competitive pricing pressures, particularly in the China market. Storage net
revenue decreased 4% as a result of a decline in traditional storage products, the effect of which was partially offset by growth in Converged Storage solutions from the 3PAR StoreServ products,



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

particularly
All-flash arrays, and StoreOnce. BCS net revenue decreased 13% largely as a result of contraction in the overall UNIX market. TS net revenue decreased 9% due primarily to a reduction in
support for BCS and traditional storage products along with lower revenue from consulting services, the effects of which were partially offset by growth in HP Data Center Care and HP Proactive Care
support solutions.

In
fiscal 2015, EG earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.1 percentage point due to a decrease in gross margin partially offset by a decrease in
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a higher revenue mix of ISS products, unfavorable currency impacts and competitive pricing, the
effects of which were partially offset by improved cost management, improved pricing in Storage and a higher gross margin contribution in Networking from Aruba. The decrease in operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenue was due primarily to favorable currency impacts, partially offset by expenses during the period from Aruba.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

EG net revenue decreased 1.0% (decreased 0.6% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. In EG, we continued to experience revenue
challenges due to market trends, including the transition to cloud computing, as well as product and technology transitions, along with a highly competitive pricing environment. The decline in EG net
revenue was due to net revenue declines in TS, BCS and Storage partially offset by net revenue growth in ISS and Networking.

TS
net revenue decreased 4% due primarily to a continued reduction in support for BCS, traditional storage products and lower support in networking services, partially offset by growth
in support solutions for Converged Storage solutions and ISS. BCS net revenue decreased 22% as a result of ongoing pressures from the overall UNIX market contraction. Storage net revenue decreased by
5% as we continue to experience multiple challenges including product transitions from traditional storage products which include our tape, storage networking and legacy external disk products, to
converged solutions, which include our 3PAR StoreServ, StoreOnce, and StoreVirtual products, other challenges
include market weakness in high-end converged solutions and sales execution challenges, the effects of which were partially offset by revenue growth in our Converged Storage solutions. Networking net
revenue increased 4% due to higher switching product revenue as a result of growth in our data center products, partially offset by lower revenue from WLAN products. ISS net revenue increased by 3%
due primarily to higher volume and higher average unit prices in rack and blade server products driven by higher option attach rates for memory, processors and hard drives.

EG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points in fiscal 2014 due to a decrease in gross margin coupled with an increase in
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin decline was due primarily to a higher mix of ISS products, a lower mix of BCS products and competitive pricing pressure in ISS and
Networking, partially offset by supply chain cost optimization and improved cost management in TS. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was driven by higher R&D
investments in storage, networking and ISS, partially offset by continued cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts.

Fiscal 2015 compared with Fiscal 2014

ES net revenue decreased 11.6% (decreased 5.7% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2015. Performance in ES remained challenged by
the impact of several large contracts winding down. The net revenue decrease in ES was due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts, revenue runoff in key accounts and weak growth in new and existing
accounts, partially offset by growth in our SES portfolio which includes analytics and data management, security and cloud services. Net revenue in ITO decreased by 14% in fiscal 2015 due to
unfavorable currency impacts, revenue runoff in key accounts and weak growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in EMEA in the first half of fiscal 2015, partially offset by growth in SES
revenue in the second half of fiscal 2015. Net revenue in Application and Business Services ("ABS") declined by 8% in fiscal 2015, due to unfavorable currency impacts and weak growth in new and
existing accounts particularly in the first half of fiscal 2015, partially offset by growth in SES net revenue in the second half of fiscal 2015.

ES
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 1.7 percentage points in fiscal 2015. The increase in operating margin was due to an increase in gross margin and a
decrease in



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Gross margin increased due primarily to service delivery efficiencies and improving profit performance in underperforming contracts. The decrease in
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by lower field selling costs, which was due to favorable currency impacts and our sales transformation initiatives.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

ES net revenue decreased 6.9% (decreased 6.8% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. Performance in ES remained challenged by
the impact of several large contracts winding down and lower public sector spending in EMEA, particularly in the United Kingdom, and several other countries in EMEA. The net revenue decrease in ES was
due primarily to revenue runoff in key accounts, weak growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in EMEA, and contractual price declines. These effects were partially offset by net revenue
growth in our SES portfolio, which includes information management and analytics, security and cloud services. Net revenue in Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing ("ITO") decreased by 8% in fiscal
2014 due to revenue runoff in key accounts, weak growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in EMEA, and contractual price declines in ongoing contracts partially offset by growth in cloud and
security revenue and favorable currency impacts. Net revenue in ABS decreased by 5% in fiscal 2014, due to revenue runoff in a key account, weak growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in
EMEA, and unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by growth in information management and analytics and cloud revenue.

ES
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 0.7 percentage points in fiscal 2014. The increase in operating margin was due to an increase in gross margin,
partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Gross margin increased due primarily to our continued focus on service delivery efficiencies, improving profit
performance in under-performing contracts and labor savings as a result of restructuring, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from revenue runoff in key accounts and weak growth in new and
existing accounts. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by the size of the revenue decline and higher administrative expenses and field selling costs.
The increase in administrative expenses was due to the prior-year period containing higher bad debt recoveries and insurance recoveries. The increase in selling costs was the result of expanding the
sales force coverage as we transition from a reactive sales model to a more proactive approach.

Software net revenue decreased 6.6% (decreased 2.7% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2015. Revenue growth in Software is being
challenged by the overall market shift to SaaS solutions and related go-to-market sales execution challenges. Additionally, these challenges are impacting growth in



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

license
and support revenue. In fiscal 2015, net revenue growth was negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations across all regions, led primarily by weakness in the euro.

In
fiscal 2015, net revenue from licenses, professional services, SaaS and support decreased by 13%, 8%, 3% and 3%, respectively. The decrease in license revenue was due primarily to the
market shift to
SaaS solutions and sales execution challenges and, as a result, we experienced lower revenue in IT Operations Management. Professional services net revenue decreased due primarily to unfavorable
currency impacts, our continued focus on higher-margin engagements, and, as a result, we experienced a net revenue decrease in big data solutions, partially offset by net revenue growth in security
products. SaaS net revenue decreased due primarily to sales execution challenges, which resulted in lower revenue from big data solutions, partially offset by net revenue growth in IT Operations
Management. The decrease in support revenue was due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and past declines in license revenue, partially offset by growth in revenue for security products.

In
fiscal 2015, Software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.4 percentage points due to a decrease in gross margin and an increase in operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a lower mix of license revenue. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to
the size of the revenue decline. During the period, operating expense declined due primarily to favorable currency impacts and lower SG&A expenses as a result of lower field selling costs driven by
expense management.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

Software net revenue decreased 2.3% (decreased 2.2% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. Revenue growth in Software was
challenged by the overall market and customer shift to SaaS solutions, which is impacting growth in license and support revenue. In fiscal 2014, net revenue from licenses, support and professional
services decreased by 3%, 2% and 6% respectively, while SaaS net revenue increased by 5%.

The
decline in license net revenue was due to the market and customer shift to SaaS solutions, which resulted in lower revenue from IT/cloud management and information management
products, partially offset by strength in some of our key focus areas of big data analytics and security. The decrease in support net revenue was due to past declines in license revenue. Professional
services net revenue decreased as we continued our focus on higher-margin engagements. These declines were partially offset by higher SaaS revenue due to improving demand for our SaaS solutions in
IT/cloud management products and security products.

In
fiscal 2014, Software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue remained flat in percentage points. There was an increase in gross margin, the effect of which was
offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin was due to the shift to more profitable contracts and improved workforce utilization in
professional services. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to investments in R&D partially offset by lower SG&A expenses due to cost savings associated
with our ongoing restructuring efforts and improved operational expense management.

HPFS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.2 percentage points in fiscal 2015 due primarily to decrease in gross margin while operating expense as
a percentage of net revenue was flat in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The decrease in gross margin was due to unfavorable currency impacts, lower margins in customer buyouts, and lower
portfolio margin due to competitive pricing, the effects of which were partially offset by higher margins from asset recovery services. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was flat as a
result of lower SG&A expenses due primarily to lower field selling costs the effects of which were offset by size of the revenue decline.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

HPFS net revenue decreased by 3.6% (decreased 3.3% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014 due primarily to lower portfolio
revenue from lower average portfolio assets and lower asset management activity, primarily in customer buyouts.

HPFS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.1 percentage points in fiscal 2014. The increase was due primarily to an increase in gross margin,
partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin was the result of a higher portfolio margin, primarily from lower bad debt expense
and a lower cost of funds and improved margins in remarketing sales. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to higher go-to-market investments.

Portfolio Assets and Ratios

The HPFS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial
services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive HPFS amounts are substantially the same as
those used by HP. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheet for HPFS were as follows:

Debt
attributable to HPFS consists of intercompany equity that is treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and
borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with HPFS and its subsidiaries. Debt attributable to HPFS totaled $10.7 billion at both October 31, 2015 and October 31, 2014.
HPFS equity at both October 31, 2015 and October 31, 2014 was $1.5 billion. We believe the HPFS debt-to-equity ratio is comparable to that of other similar financing companies.

At
October 31, 2015 and October 31, 2014, HPFS cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were $589 million and $952 million, respectively.

Net
portfolio assets at October 31, 2015 increased 2% from October 31, 2014. The increase generally resulted from new financing volume partially offset by portfolio runoff

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows are generally
sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, principal and interest payment of debt, income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends, in
addition to investments and share repurchases. We are able to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various
domestic and foreign financial institutions. Our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions; however,
our access to a variety of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions. Our liquidity is subject to various
risks including the risks identified in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk" in Item 7A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our
cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with substantially all of those amounts held outside of the U.S. We utilize a variety of planning and financing
strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. Our cash position remains strong, and we expect that our cash balances, anticipated cash flow
generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected near-term cash outlays.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Amounts
held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support non-U.S. liquidity needs, although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to short-term
intercompany loans into the U.S. Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under current law, some would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less
applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign earnings is restricted by local law. Except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., we have
provided for the U.S. federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes. Repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years. Where local restrictions
prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the U.S. and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external
borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial
condition or results of operations.

In
connection with the Separation, we reviewed our capital structure during fiscal 2015 to ensure that each company, HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, would be well
capitalized after the Separation. In October 2015, prior to the Separation, Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed its offering of $14.6 billion senior unsecured notes and we redeemed and paid
$6.6 billion of U.S. Dollar Global Notes as a result of early extinguishment of debt. In connection with our ongoing operations and in part due to the Separation, we repaid a short-term loan of
$3.5 billion, issued $18.2 billion and repaid $18.4 billion of commercial paper in fiscal 2015. On November 4, 2015, we incrementally redeemed and paid $2.1 billion
U.S. Dollar Global Notes as part of the final settlement of the debt redemption issued as a part of the Separation.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $5.8 billion for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.
The decrease was due primarily to lower cash generated from working capital management activities, payments for separation costs, lower cash receipts from contract manufacturers and financing
receivables, lower net earnings in the current period, unfavorable currency impacts, as well as higher cash payments for prepaids and employee benefits. Net cash provided by operating activities
increased by $0.7 billion for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013, due primarily to improvements in working capital management.

Days
of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable,
net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. For fiscal 2015, the increase in DSO was due primarily to lower usage of cash discounts by our customers and longer standard
payment terms for Aruba. For fiscal 2014, the decrease in DSO was due primarily to the impact of currency and the expansion of our factoring programs.

Days
of supply in inventory ("DOS") measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of
cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2015, the increase in DOS was due to higher inventory balance to support future sales levels. For fiscal 2014, the increase in DOS was due to a higher inventory balance
in Personal Systems due in part to strategic and advanced buys.

Days
of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("DPO") measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts
payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2015, the increase in DPO was primarily the result of purchasing linearity and an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers.
For fiscal 2014, the increase in DPO was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers.

The
cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. Items which may cause the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a long-term sustainable rate include,
but are not
limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms, extent of receivables factoring, seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately $2.7 billion for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, due
primarily to the acquisition of Aruba. Net cash used in investing activities



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

was
flat for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013, due primarily to higher cash utilization for purchases of property, plant and equipment offset by cash generated from sales of available-for-sale
securities.

Financing Activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015 as compared to net cash used in financing activities
of $6.6 billion in fiscal 2014. The change was due primarily to proceeds from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in October 2015 by Hewlett Packard Enterprise in principal amount of
$14.6 billion and higher proceeds from issuance of commercial paper, partially offset by the repayment as a result of early debt extinguishment of $6.6 billion of U.S. Dollar Global
Notes and higher repayment of commercial paper as compared to fiscal 2014. Net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $1.4 billion for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal
2013 due primarily to proceeds from the issuance of U.S. Dollar Global Notes in January 2014, partially offset by higher debt repayments and repurchases of common stock. For more information on our
share repurchase programs, see Item 5 and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Short-term
debt decreased by $601 million and long-term debt increased by approximately $5.7 billion for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014. The net increase in total
debt was due primarily to issuance of senior unsecured notes in October 2015 by Hewlett Packard Enterprise in principal amount of $14.6 billion which includes of $14.0 billion fixed rate
notes and $600 million of floating rate notes, partially offset by the payment as a result of early debt extinguishment of $6.6 billion in connection with the Separation, maturities of
$2.5 billion of U.S. Dollar Global Notes and repayment of $3.5 billion of short-term loan. We also issued $18.2 billion and repaid $18.4 billion of commercial paper in fiscal
2015. On November 4, 2015, we paid $2.1 billion of U.S. Dollar Global Notes as part of the final settlement of the debt redemption issued as a part of the Separation.

Short-term
debt and long-term debt decreased by approximately $2.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The net decrease in
total debt was due primarily to maturities of debt. During fiscal 2014, we issued $2.0 billion of U.S. Dollar Global Notes under the 2012
Shelf Registration Statement which mature in 2019 and repaid $4.9 billion of U.S. Dollar Global Notes. We also issued $11.6 billion and repaid $11.5 billion of commercial paper in
fiscal 2014.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Our
debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders' equity. Our debt-to-equity ratio increased by 0.16x in fiscal 2015, due to an
increase in total debt balances of $5.1 billion partially offset by an increase in stockholders' equity by $1.0 billion at the end of fiscal 2015. Our debt-to-equity ratio decreased by
0.10x in fiscal 2014, due to a decrease in total debt balances of $3.1 billion partially offset by a decrease in stockholders' equity by $0.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2014.

Our
weighted-average interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps. For more
information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Credit Ratings

Our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information
obtained in our ongoing discussions with them. While we do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt, previous downgrades have
increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities, have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative
contracts. In addition, any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner, and, depending on the extent of any such downgrade, could have a
negative impact on our liquidity and capital position. We can rely on alternative sources of funding, including drawdowns under our credit facilities, if necessary, to offset potential reductions in
the market capacity for our commercial paper.

Amounts
represent the principal cash payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments,

(2)

Amounts
represent the expected interest payments relating to our short-term and long-term debt. We have outstanding interest rate swap
agreements accounted for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our U.S. Dollar Global Notes to variable interest rates. The impact
of our outstanding interest rate swaps at October 31, 2015 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on debt. Subsequent to the Separation, HP Inc. expects the total
future interest payments on debt to be approximately $2.9 billion.

Amounts
represent the operating lease obligations net of total sublease income of $77 million. Subsequent to the Separation, HP Inc.
expects the total remaining future minimum operating lease commitments to be approximately $367 million, net of sublease income of $118 million.

Purchase
obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all
significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These purchase obligations are
related principally to inventory and other items. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine
arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. Even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the
terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services. Subsequent to the Separation,
HP Inc. expects the total remaining future unconditional purchase obligations to be approximately $915 million.

(5)

Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plan Contributions.

As of October 31,
2015, HP (including Hewlett Packard Enterprise) expects to contribute approximately $384 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, approximately $37 million to cover benefit payments to
U.S. non-qualified plan participants and approximately $46 million to cover benefit claims for HP's post-retirement benefit plans in fiscal 2016. Subsequent to the Separation, HP Inc.
expects to contribute approximately



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

$18 million
to its non-U.S. pension plans, approximately $36 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants and approximately $43 million to cover
benefit claims for HP's post-retirement benefit plans. Our policy is to fund our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government,
funding and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent
contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in a wide range of outcomes. For more
information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

(6)

Restructuring Plans.

As of October 31, 2015, HP (including Hewlett Packard
Enterprise) expects future cash payments of approximately $3.2 billion in connection with our approved restructuring plans which includes $1.3 billion expected to be paid in fiscal 2016 with the
remaining approximately $1.9 billion cash payments to be made through fiscal 2025. Subsequent to the Separation, HP Inc. expects future cash payments of approximately $280 million in connection with
our approved restructuring plans which includes $90 million expected to be paid in fiscal 2016 with the remaining approximately $190 million cash payments to be made through fiscal 2025. Payments for
restructuring have been excluded from the contractual obligations table, because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more
information on our restructuring activities, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

(7)

Separation Costs.

As of October 31, 2015, HP (including Hewlett Packard
Enterprise) expects future cash payments of approximately $750 million in connection with our separation charges and net foreign tax payments, which are expected to be paid in fiscal 2016, with
subsequent tax credit amounts expected over later years. As of October 31, 2015, we also expect separation-related capital expenditures of approximately $60 million in fiscal 2016.
Subsequent to the Separation, HP Inc. expects future cash payments of approximately $180 million in connection with our separation charges and net foreign tax payments, which are
expected to be paid in fiscal 2016, with subsequent tax credit amounts expected over later years. As of October 31, 2015, HP Inc. also expects separation-related capital expenditures of
approximately $30 million in fiscal 2016. Payments for separation costs have been excluded from the contractual obligations table, because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and
there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments.

(8)

Uncertain Tax Positions.

As of October 31, 2015, we had approximately
$3.7 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to uncertain tax positions. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include $15 million
expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties
related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

structured
finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

We

capacity of $1.9 billion in partial-recourse facilities. For more information on our third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.



ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our
financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only
to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects
of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below.

Actual
gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate
movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 79 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our
operations for fiscal 2015 were the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan renminbi and the Japanese yen. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a
weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely
affect certain expense figures, if taken alone.

We
use a combination of forward contracts and at times, options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net
revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use
swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the risk
associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too
expensive to hedge.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative
contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2015 and 2014.
The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $72 million and
$62 million at October 31, 2015 and October 31, 2014, respectively.

Interest rate risk

We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables.

We
issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. We often use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the
market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense.



The
swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously
executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial.

In
order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. We may use
cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based interest income received on certain variable-rate investments. We may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest
returns into fixed-rate interest returns.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investments, financing receivables and interest
rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt, investments, financing receivables and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates
in effect at October 31, 2015 and 2014. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt,
investments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swaps, of $119 million at October 31, 2015 and $80 million at October 31, 2014.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of HP Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HP Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2015 and 2014,
and the related consolidated statements of earnings,
comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2015. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of HP Inc. and subsidiaries at
October 31, 2015 and 2014, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2015, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), HP Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of
October 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013
framework) and our report dated December 16, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of HP Inc.

We have audited HP Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2015, based on criteria established
in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). HP Inc.'s management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, HP Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of HP Inc.
and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended October 31, 2015 and our report dated December 16, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

HP's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for HP. HP's
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. HP's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of HP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of HP are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of HP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of HP's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

HP's
management assessed the effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2015, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on the assessment by HP's management, we determined that HP's
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2015. The effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2015 has been
audited by Ernst & Young LLP, HP's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 86 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Overview

On November 1, 2015 (the "Distribution Date"), Hewlett-Packard Company completed the separation of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
Company ("Hewlett Packard Enterprise"), Hewlett-Packard Company's former enterprise technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses (the "Separation"). In connection with the
Separation, Hewlett-Packard Company changed its name to HP Inc. ("HP").

On
November 1, 2015, each of HP stockholders of record as of the close of business on October 21, 2015 (the "Record Date") received one share of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
common stock for every one share of HP's common stock held as of the Record Date. Hewlett Packard Enterprise is now an independent public company trading on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under
the symbol
"HPE". After the Separation, HP does not beneficially own any shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock and beginning November 1, 2015, HP no longer consolidates Hewlett Packard
Enterprise within its financial results or reflect the financial results of Hewlett Packard Enterprise within its continuing results of operations.

In
connection with the Separation, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have entered into a separation and distribution agreement as well as various other agreements that provide a
framework for the relationships between the parties going forward, including among others a tax matters agreement, an employee matters agreement, a transition service agreement, a real estate matters
agreement, a master commercial agreement and an information technology service agreement. These agreements provide for the allocation between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise of assets, employees,
liabilities and obligations (including its investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after the Separation and govern
certain relationship between HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise after the Separation. For more information on the impacts of these agreements, see Note 3 "Restructuring", Note 4
"Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans", Note 5 "Stock-Based Compensation", Note 6 "Taxes on Earnings", Note 13 "Borrowings", Note 16 "Litigation and Contingencies"
and Note 17 "Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties".

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements of HP and its wholly-owned subsidiaries are prepared in conformity with United
States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). HP has eliminated all intercompany accounts and transactions. The historical results of operations, financial position, and cash
flows of Hewlett Packard Enterprise are included in the consolidated financial statements of HP for each of the fiscal years included in this report and will be reported as discontinued operations
beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of HP and its subsidiaries and affiliates in which HP has a controlling
financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. HP accounts for investments in companies over which HP has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not hold a controlling interest
under the equity method, and HP records its proportionate share of income or losses in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. HP presents non-controlling interests as a
separate component within Total stockholder's equity in the Consolidated



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Balance
Sheets. Net earnings attributable to the non-controlling interests are eliminated within Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are not presented separately as
they were not material for any period presented.

Reclassifications

HP has made certain segment and business unit realignments in order to optimize its operating structure. Reclassifications of certain
prior-year segment and business unit financial information have been made to conform to the current-year presentation. None of the changes impacts HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue,
earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share ("EPS"). See Note 2 for a further discussion of HP's segment reorganization.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in HP's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

HP predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are remeasured
into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, costs and expenses denominated in
non-U.S. dollars are recorded in U.S. dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. HP includes gains or losses
from foreign currency remeasurement in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and
HP records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive
loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Accounting Pronouncements

In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standards update for income taxes, which
requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. The new accounting guidance is effective for annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of interim or annual reporting periods. HP is currently assessing
the impact of this adoption on its Consolidated Financial Statements, and plans to adopt for its interim and annual reporting period beginning November 1, 2015.

In
April 2015, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for intangible assets. The amendments provide explicit guidance to customers in determining the accounting for fees paid
in a cloud computing arrangement, wherein the arrangements that do not convey a software license to the customer are accounted for as service contracts. HP is required to adopt the guidance in the
first quarter of fiscal 2017; however early adoption is permitted as is retrospective application. HP is currently evaluating the impact of these amendments on its Consolidated Financial Statements.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In
April 2015, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for imputation of interest. The amendments require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be
presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs
are not affected by these amendments. HP is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively with the
adjusted balance sheet of each individual period presented, in order to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. HP is currently evaluating the timing and the impact of these
amendments on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
May 2014, the FASB amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the
FASB issued an accounting standard update for a one-year deferral of the effective date, with an option of applying the standard on the original effective date, which for HP is the first quarter of
fiscal 2018. In accordance with this deferral, HP is required to adopt these amendments in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period
presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. HP is continuing to evaluate the impact of these amendments and the transition alternatives on
its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
April 2014, the FASB issued guidance which changes the criteria for identifying a discontinued operation. The guidance limits the definition of a discontinued operation to the
disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations
and financial results. HP is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016.

Revenue Recognition

General

HP recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales
price or fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. Additionally, HP recognizes hardware revenue on sales to channel partners, including resellers, distributors or
value-added solution providers at the time of delivery when the channel partners have economic substance apart from HP, and HP has completed its obligations related to the sale. HP generally
recognizes revenue for its standalone software sales to channel partners on receipt of evidence that the software has been sold to a specific end user. HP limits the amount of revenue recognized for
delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations or subject to customer-specified refund or return rights.

HP
reduces revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns, at
the later of the date of revenue recognition or the date the sales incentive is offered. Future market conditions and
product transitions may require HP to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. For certain



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

incentive
programs, HP estimates the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive.

In
instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor products or services, HP records revenue on a gross basis when HP is a principal to the transaction and on a net
basis when HP is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor. HP considers several factors to determine whether it is acting as a principal or an agent, most notably whether HP is the
primary obligor to the customer, has established its own pricing and has inventory and credit risks.

HP
reports revenue net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the
relevant government authority.

Multiple element arrangements

When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements or deliverables, such as hardware and software products, and/or services, HP
allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price, if available,
third-party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP") if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. HP establishes VSOE of selling price
using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. HP establishes TPE of selling price by
evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. HP establishes ESP based on management judgment considering internal
factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor
pricing strategies and technology industry life cycles. In most arrangements with multiple elements, HP allocates the transaction price to the individual units of accounting at inception of the
arrangement based on their relative selling price.

In
multiple element arrangements that include software that is more-than-incidental, HP allocates the transaction price to the individual units of accounting for the non-software
deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling price of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy. If the arrangement
contains more than one software deliverable, the transaction price allocated to the group of software deliverables is then allocated to each component software deliverable.

HP
evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has
standalone value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, HP recognizes revenue consistent with the pattern of the undelivered elements. If the arrangement includes a
customer-negotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items, and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially
within HP's control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price among
elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Product revenue

Hardware

Under HP's standard terms and conditions of sale, HP transfers title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is delivered
to the customer and recognizes revenue accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations to the customer remain. HP reduces revenue for estimated customer returns, price
protection, rebates and other programs offered under sales agreements established by HP with its distributors and resellers. HP records revenue from the sale of equipment under sales-type leases as
product revenue at the inception of the lease. HP accrues the estimated cost of post-sale obligations, including standard product warranties, based on historical experience at the time HP recognizes
revenue.

Software

HP recognizes revenue from perpetual software licenses at the inception of the license term, assuming all revenue recognition criteria
have been satisfied. Term-based software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license. HP uses the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception
of the arrangement when VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, such as post-contract customer support, exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. HP recognizes
revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on a when-and- if-available basis ratably over the period during which such items are delivered.

HP
recognizes revenue for hosting or software-as-a-service ("SaaS") arrangements as the service is delivered, generally on a straight-line basis, over the contractual period of
performance. In hosting arrangements, HP considers the rights provided to the customer (e.g. whether the customer has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during
the hosting period without significant penalty and the feasibility of the customer to operate or contract with another vendor to operate the software) in determining whether the arrangement includes
the sale of a software license. In hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold, license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold, when all
other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied.

Services revenue

HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software
post-contract customer support agreements, ratably over the contract period and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred. For time and material contracts, HP recognizes revenue
as services are rendered and recognizes costs as they are incurred.

HP
recognizes revenue from certain fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements, as work progresses over the contract period on a proportional performance basis, as determined
by the percentage of labor costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated labor costs of a contract. HP recognizes revenue on fixed-price contracts for design and build projects (to design,
develop and construct software and systems) using the percentage-of-completion method. HP uses the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of cost
incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project. Estimates of total project costs for fixed-price



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

contracts
are regularly revised during the life of a contract. Provisions for estimated losses on fixed-priced contracts are recognized in the period when such losses become known. If reasonable and
reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made, HP uses the completed contract method and recognizes revenue and costs upon service completion.

HP
generally recognizes outsourcing services revenue in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event. HP
recognizes revenue using an objective measure of output for unit-priced contracts. Revenue for fixed-price outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straight-line basis if the
service is provided evenly during the contract term. Provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable.

HP
recognizes revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis as service revenue over the rental period.

Financing income

Sales-type and direct-financing leases produce financing income, which HP recognizes at consistent rates of return over the lease term.

Deferred revenue and deferred costs

HP records amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are
satisfied. HP records revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on services contracts as trade receivables.

Deferred
revenue represents amounts invoiced in advance for product support contracts, software customer support contracts, outsourcing startup services work, consulting and integration
projects, product sales or leasing income.

HP
recognizes costs associated with outsourcing contracts as incurred, unless such costs are considered direct and incremental to the startup phase of the contract, in which case HP
defers these costs during the startup phase and subsequently amortizes such costs over the period that outsourcing services are provided, once those services commence. HP amortizes deferred contract
costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the contract unless facts and circumstances of the contract indicate a shorter period is more appropriate. Based on actual and projected
contract financial performance indicators, HP analyzes the recoverability of deferred contract costs using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract over its remaining term. If such
undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of deferred contract costs and long-lived assets directly associated with the contract, the deferred contract costs are first
impaired. If a cash flow deficiency remains after reducing the carrying amount of the deferred contract costs to zero, HP evaluates any remaining long-lived assets related to that contract for
impairment.

Shipping and Handling

HP includes costs related to shipping and handling in Cost of products.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Stock-Based Compensation

HP determines stock-based compensation expense based on the measurement date fair value of the award. HP recognizes compensation cost
only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. HP determines compensation costs at the
aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance and/or market conditions. HP estimates the forfeiture rate based on its
historical experience.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans

HP has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory retirement and post-retirement plans. HP generally amortizes
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the average remaining estimated service life of participants. In some cases, HP amortizes actuarial gains and losses using the
corridor approach. See Note 4 for a full description of these plans and the accounting and funding policies.

Advertising

Costs to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate advertising are expensed when the
advertising is first run. Such costs totaled approximately $859 million in fiscal 2015, $834 million in fiscal 2014 and $867 million in fiscal 2013.

Restructuring

HP records charges associated with management-approved restructuring plans to reorganize one or more of HP's business segments, to
remove duplicative headcount and infrastructure associated with business acquisitions or to simplify business processes and accelerate innovation. Restructuring charges can include severance costs to
eliminate a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. HP records restructuring charges based on estimated
employee terminations and site closure and consolidation plans. HP accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the
amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements.

Taxes on Earnings

HP recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. HP records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax
assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

HP
records accruals for uncertain tax positions when HP believes that it is not more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
based on the technical merits of the position. HP makes adjustments to these accruals when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. The
provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions, as well as any related interest and penalties.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Accounts Receivable

HP establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable. HP records a specific reserve for individual accounts when
HP becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If there are additional
changes in circumstances related to the specific customer, HP further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. HP maintains bad debt reserves for all other customers based on a variety
of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, the financial condition of customers, the length
of time receivables are past due, trends in the weighted-average risk rating for the portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, information derived from competitive benchmarking, significant one-time events
and historical experience. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable.

HP
has third-party short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. These financing arrangements, which in certain cases
provide for
partial recourse, result in the transfer of HP's trade receivables to a third party. HP reflects amounts transferred to, but not yet collected from, the third party in accounts receivable in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. For arrangements involving an element of recourse, the fair value of the recourse obligation is measured using market data from similar transactions and reported as a
current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Concentrations of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject HP to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents, investments, receivables from trade customers and contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.

HP
maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located in
many different geographic regions, and HP's policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. As part of its risk management processes, HP performs periodic evaluations of the
relative credit standing of these financial institutions. HP has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. HP utilizes derivative contracts to protect
against the effects of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result in a material loss.

HP
sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant receivable balances with these parties.
If the financial condition or operations of these distributors' and resellers' aggregated business deteriorates substantially, HP's operating results could be adversely affected. The ten largest
distributor and reseller receivable balances, which were concentrated primarily in North America and Europe, collectively represented 18% and 20% of gross accounts receivable as of October 31,
2015 and 2014, respectively. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of gross accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable and financing receivables is generally
diversified due to the large number of entities comprising HP's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions. HP performs ongoing credit evaluations of
the financial condition of its third-party distributors,



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

resellers
and other customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances.

HP
utilizes outsourced contract manufacturers around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. HP may purchase product components from suppliers and sell those components to its
contract manufacturers thereby creating receivable balances from contract manufacturers. The three largest contract manufacturer receivable balances collectively represented 60% and 65% of HP's
receivables from contract manufacturers of $1.0 billion as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. HP includes receivables from contract manufacturers in Other current assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets on a gross basis. HP's credit risk associated with these receivables is mitigated wholly or in part, by the amount HP owes to these outsourced contract manufacturers, as HP
generally has the legal right to offset its payables to contract manufacturers against these receivables. HP does not reflect the sale of these components in revenue and does not recognize any profit
on these component sales until the related products are sold by HP, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales.

HP
obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. The loss of a single source supplier,
the deterioration of HP's relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which HP is supplied components by a single source supplier could
adversely affect HP's revenue and gross margins.

Inventory

HP values inventory at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in,
first-out basis. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess or obsolescence.

Property, Plant and Equipment

HP states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. HP capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses
maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are five to 40 years for
buildings and improvements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. HP depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. HP depreciates
equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. The estimated useful lives of assets used solely to support a customer services contract
generally do not exceed the term of the customer contract. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any
gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

HP
capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and
installation and testing of the software. HP amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally from three to
five years.

Business Combinations

HP includes the results of operations of acquired businesses in HP's consolidated results prospectively from the date of acquisition.
HP allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, including in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the
acquired entity generally based on their fair values at the acquisition date. IPR&D is initially capitalized at fair value as an intangible asset with an indefinite life and assessed for impairment
thereafter. When the IPR&D project is complete, it is reclassified as an amortizable purchased intangible asset and is amortized over its estimated useful life. If an IPR&D project is abandoned, HP
will record a charge for the value of the related intangible asset to HP's Consolidated Statement of Earnings in the period it is abandoned. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over
the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of
the synergies between the acquired company and HP and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses and
post-acquisition restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed as incurred.

Goodwill

HP reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill
may not be recoverable. While HP is permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, for its annual
goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, HP performed a quantitative test for all of its reporting units. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of
October 31, 2015, HP's reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, except for Enterprise Services ("ES"), which consists of two reporting units:
MphasiS Limited and the remainder of ES.

In
the first step of the impairment test, HP compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. HP estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting
of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, HP estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the
present value of estimated future cash flows. HP bases cash flow projections on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market
conditions. HP bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the
reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, HP estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable
publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. HP weights the fair value derived from the market approach depending on the level of
comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the
reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, HP estimates the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach. For the MphasiS Limited reporting unit, HP
utilized the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value.

In
order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of HP's reporting units, HP compares the aggregate reporting unit fair value to HP's market capitalization and
calculates an



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

implied
control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units' fair value over HP's market capitalization). HP evaluates the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from
recent comparable transactions. If the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in light of these recent transactions, HP reevaluates reporting unit fair values, which may result in an
adjustment to the discount rate and/or other assumptions. This reevaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all reporting units.

If
the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then HP performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second
step, HP measures the reporting unit's assets, including any unrecognized intangible assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied
fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is
less than its carrying amount, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.

Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets

HP reviews intangible assets with finite lives and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. HP assesses the recoverability of assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and
eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is impaired. HP measures the amount of impairment loss, if any, as the difference
between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market approach. HP amortizes intangible assets with finite lives using
the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from one to ten years.

Debt and Marketable Equity Securities Investments

Debt and marketable equity securities are generally considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses, net of applicable taxes, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are calculated based on the
specific identification method and included in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. HP monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a quarterly basis.
When the carrying amount of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary (i.e., when HP does not intend to sell the
debt securities and it is not more likely than not that HP will be required to sell the debt securities prior to anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis), HP records an impairment charge to
Interest and other, net in the amount of the credit loss and the balance, if any, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivatives

HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and at times, options, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate
exposures. HP also may use other derivative instruments not

Note 1: Overview and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

designated
as hedges, such as forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. HP does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 12 for a full
description of HP's derivative financial instrument activities and related accounting policies.

Loss Contingencies

HP is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP records a
liability for contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 16 for a full description of
HP's loss contingencies and related accounting policies.

Note 2: Segment Information

HP is a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses ("SMBs") and large enterprises,
including customers in the government, health and education sectors. HP's offerings span the following:

•

personal computing and other access devices;

•

imaging- and printing-related products and services;

•

enterprise information technology ("IT") infrastructure, including enterprise server and storage technology, networking products and
solutions, and technology support and maintenance;

•

multi-vendor customer services, including technology consulting, outsourcing and support services across infrastructure, applications
and business process domains; and

•

software products and solutions, including application testing and delivery, big data analytics, enterprise security, information
governance and IT Operations Management.

HP's
operations are organized into seven segments for financial reporting purposes: Personal Systems, Printing, the Enterprise Group ("EG"), Enterprise Services ("ES"), Software, HP
Financial Services ("HPFS") and Corporate Investments. HP's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that management uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations, which
include, but are not limited to, customer base and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by HP's management to
evaluate segment results.

The
Personal Systems segment and the Printing segment are structured beneath a broader Printing and Personal Systems Group ("PPS"). While PPS is not a reportable segment, HP may provide
financial data aggregating the Personal Systems and the Printing segments in order to provide a supplementary view of its business.

As
a result of the Separation, beginning November 1, 2015, HP will report three segments as part of continuing operations: Personal Systems, Printing and Corporate Investments.

A
summary description of each segment follows.

The

Printing and Personal Systems Group's

mission is to leverage the respective strengths of the Personal Systems business and the
Printing business by creating a unified organization that is

Note 2: Segment Information (Continued)

Segment Policy

HP derives the results of the business segments directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting
policies HP uses to derive segment results are
substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. Management measures the performance of each segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations. Management uses these
results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to, each of the segments.

Segment
revenue includes revenues from sales to external customers and intersegment revenues that reflect transactions between the segments on an arm's-length basis. Intersegment
revenues primarily consist of sales of hardware and software that are sourced internally and, in the majority of the cases, are financed as operating leases by HPFS. HP's consolidated net revenue is
derived and reported after the elimination of intersegment revenues from such arrangements.

HP
periodically engages in intercompany advanced royalty payment and licensing arrangements that may result in advance payments between subsidiaries. Revenues from these intercompany
arrangements are deferred and recognized as earned over the term of the arrangement by the HP legal entities involved in such transactions; however, these advanced payments are eliminated from
revenues as reported by HP and its business segments. As disclosed in Note 6, during fiscal 2015, HP executed an intercompany advanced royalty payment arrangement resulting in advanced payments
of $8.8 billion, while during fiscal 2014 HP executed a multi-year intercompany licensing arrangement and intercompany advanced royalty payment arrangement which resulted in combined advanced
payments of $11.5 billion. In these transactions, the payments were received in the U.S. from a foreign consolidated affiliate, with a deferral of intercompany revenues over the term of the
arrangements, approximately 5 years and 15 years, respectively. The impact of these intercompany arrangements is eliminated from both HP consolidated and segment revenues.

Financing
interest in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings reflects interest expense on debt attributable to HPFS. Debt attributable to HPFS consists of intercompany equity that is
treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with HPFS and its subsidiaries.

HP
does not allocate to its segments certain operating expenses, which it manages at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include certain corporate governance costs, stock-based
compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, restructuring charges, acquisition and other related charges, separation costs, defined benefit plan settlement charges and impairment of data
center assets.

Segment Realignment

Effective at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2015, HP implemented an organizational change to align its segment financial
reporting more closely with its current business structure. This organizational change resulted in the transfer of third-party multi-vendor support arrangements from the Technology Services ("TS")
business unit within the EG
segment to the ITO business unit within the ES segment. HP has reflected this change to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which has resulted in the removal of
intersegment revenue from the TS business unit within the EG segment and the related corporate intersegment revenue eliminations, and the transfer of operating profit from the TS business unit within
the EG segment to the ITO business unit within the ES segment.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 2: Segment Information (Continued)

In
connection with the Separation, effective at the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, HP implemented an organizational change which resulted in the transfer of marketing
optimization solutions business from the Software segment to the Commercial Hardware business unit within the Printing segment. HP has reflected this change to its segment information in prior
reporting periods on an as-if basis, which resulted in the transfer of net revenue from the Software segment to the Commercial Hardware business unit within the Printing segment. This change also
resulted in the transfer of operating profit from the Software segment to the Commercial Hardware business unit within the Printing segment. In addition, this change resulted in the reclassification
of $512 million of goodwill from the Software segment to the Printing segment.

These
changes had no impact on HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net EPS.

Fiscal 2015 Restructuring Plan

In connection with the Separation, on September 14, 2015, HP's Board of Directors approved a cost saving and investment proposal
which includes a restructuring plan (the "2015 Plan") which will be implemented through fiscal 2018. As part of the 2015 Plan, HP expects up to approximately 33,300 employees to exit the company by
the end of 2018. These workforce reductions are primarily associated with the ES segment. The changes to the workforce will vary by country, based on local legal requirements and consultations with
employee works councils and other employee representatives, as appropriate. HP estimates that it will incur aggregate pre-tax charges through fiscal 2018 of approximately $2.9 billion in
connection with the 2015 Plan, of which the estimated cost for HP Inc. is approximately $280 million. Total estimated charges as a result of workforce reductions are approximately $2.4 billion and
total estimated charges for real estate consolidation are approximately $506 million.

Note 3: Restructuring (Continued)

Fiscal 2012 Restructuring Plan

On May 23, 2012, HP adopted a multi-year restructuring plan (the "2012 Plan") designed to simplify business processes,
accelerate innovation and deliver better results for customers, employees and stockholders. As of October 31, 2015 HP eliminated 55,800 positions in connection with the 2012 Plan, with a
portion of those employees exiting the company as part of voluntary enhanced early retirement ("EER") programs in the U.S. and in certain other countries. HP recognized $5.5 billion in total
aggregate charges in connection with the 2012 Plan, with $4.9 billion related to workforce reductions, including the EER programs, and $589 million related to infrastructure, including
data center and real estate consolidation and other items. The severance and infrastructure related cash payments associated with the 2012 Plan are expected to be paid out through fiscal 2021. As of
October 31, 2015, the 2012 Plan is considered completed. HP does not expect any additional charges to this plan.

Other Plans

Restructuring plans initiated by HP in fiscal 2008 and 2010 were substantially completed as of October 31, 2015. Severance and
infrastructure related cash payments associated with the other plans are expected to be paid out through fiscal 2019.

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

HP sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans worldwide. The most significant defined benefit plans are in the U.S. The HP
Pension Plan ("Pension Plan") includes the former HP Retirement Plan and the former HP Company Cash Account Pension Plan ("Cash Account Pension Plan"). Under the HP Retirement Plan, benefits are based
on pay and years of service, and under the Cash Account Pension Plan, benefits are accrued pursuant to a formula based on a percentage of pay plus interest. The Pension Plan was frozen effective
January 1, 2008. The Cash Account Pension Plan was merged into the Pension Plan in 2005 for certain funding and investment purposes. Effective October 30, 2009, the Electronic
Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") U.S. qualified pension plan was merged into the Pension Plan. The EDS plan was frozen effective January 1, 2009.

HP
reduces the benefit payable to certain U.S. employees under the Pension Plan for service before 1993, if any, by any amounts due to the employee under HP's frozen defined contribution
Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("DPSP"). HP closed the DPSP to new participants in 1993. The DPSP obligations are equal to the plan assets and are recognized as an offset to the Pension Plan when HP

calculates
its defined benefit pension cost and obligations. The fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit plans combined with the DPSP were as follows:

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

HP sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, of which the most significant are in the U.S. Under the HP Retiree Welfare
Benefits Plan, certain pre-2003 retirees and grandfathered participants with continuous service to HP since 2002 are eligible to receive partially-subsidized medical coverage based on years of service
at retirement. Former grandfathered employees of Digital Equipment Corporation also receive partially-subsidized medical benefits that are not service-based. HP's share of the premium cost is capped
for all subsidized medical coverage provided under the HP Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan. HP currently leverages the employer group waiver plan process to provide HP Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan
post-65 prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D, thereby giving HP access to federal subsidies to help pay for retiree benefits.

Certain
employees not grandfathered under the above programs, as well as employees hired after 2002 but before August 2008, are eligible for credits under the HP Retirement Medical
Savings Account Plan ("RMSA") upon attaining age 45. Credits offered after September 2008 are provided in the form of matching credits on employee contributions made to a voluntary employee
beneficiary association. Upon retirement, former employees may use these credits for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses, including premiums required for coverage.

Defined Contribution Plans

HP offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution expense was
$542 million in fiscal 2015, $573 million in fiscal 2014 and $603 million in fiscal 2013.

U.S.
employees are automatically enrolled in the HP 401(k) Plan when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation. The quarterly employer matching contributions
in the HP 401(k) Plan are 100% of an employee's contributions, up to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation.

Lump sum program

In January 2015, HP offered certain terminated vested participants of the U.S. HP Pension Plan the option of receiving their pension
benefit in a one-time voluntary lump sum within a specified window. Approximately 50% of the eligible participants elected to receive their benefits and as a result the pension plan trust paid $826
million in lump sum payments to these participants in fiscal 2015. As a result of the lump sum program, HP recognized a settlement expense of approximately $96 million and a remeasurement of the U.S.
HP Pension Plan was required. The remeasurement also resulted in an additional net periodic benefit cost of $45 million for fiscal 2015 which was recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings
along with the settlement expense.

During
fiscal 2015, certain events, primarily the Separation and settlement as a result of the lump sum program, required multiple pension plans to be remeasured during the year. Thus,
the assumptions used to calculate the net benefit (credit) cost for the remaining portion of the fiscal year after remeasurement were re-determined based on then current market conditions.

The
weighted-average assumptions used to calculate net benefit (credit) cost were as follows:

For
the U.S. defined benefit plans, HP adopted a new mortality table in fiscal 2014 to better reflect expected lifetimes of its U.S. plan participants. The table used is based on a
historical demographic study of the plans and increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $870 million for the year ended October 31, 2014. The increase in the projected
benefit obligation in fiscal 2014 was recognized as a part of the net actuarial loss as included in the other comprehensive loss which is being amortized over the remaining estimated life of plan
participants.

The
net amounts recognized for HP's defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans in HP's Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure plan assets at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used during the reporting period.

Investments
in publicly-traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are
traded. For corporate, government and asset-backed debt securities, fair value is based on observable inputs of comparable market transactions. For corporate and government debt securities traded on
active exchanges, fair value is based on observable quoted prices. The valuation of alternative investments, such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management
judgment. For alternative investments, valuation is based on net asset value ("NAV") as reported by the Asset Manager and adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety
of factors



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

are
reviewed by management, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of NAV as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the last NAV
reported by the asset manager. Depending on the amount of management judgment, the lack of near-term liquidity, and the absence of quoted market prices, these assets are classified in Level 2
or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Further, depending on how quickly HP can redeem its hedge fund investments, and the extent of any adjustments to NAV, hedge funds are classified in
either Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Common collective trusts, interests in 103-12 entities and registered investment companies are valued at NAV. The valuation for
some of these assets requires judgment due
to the absence of quoted market prices, and these assets are generally classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Cash and cash equivalents includes money market funds, which are valued
based on NAV. Other assets, including insurance group annuity contracts, were classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input (e.g., quoted prices and observable inputs)
that is significant to the fair value measure in its entirety.

Investment Policy

HP's investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded
status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority of the plans' investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad
markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the
plans' investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and HP may utilize derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment
or liability exposures.

The
target asset allocation selected for each U.S. plan reflects a risk/return profile HP believes is appropriate relative to each plan's liability structure and return goals. HP
conducts periodic asset-liability studies for U.S. plans in order to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plan's forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs. HP invests a
portion of the U.S. defined benefit

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

plan
assets and post-retirement benefit plan assets in private market securities such as private equity funds to provide diversification and a higher expected return on assets.

Outside
the U.S., asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. As in the U.S., investment objectives are designed to generate
returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed
income securities than would otherwise be deployed. HP reviews the investment strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions on asset
allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees for the specific plan.

Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests
and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns which considers
each country's specific inflation outlook. Because HP's investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns are adjusted
to reflect the expected additional returns net of fees.

Future Contributions and Funding Policy

As of October 31, 2015, HP (including Hewlett Packard Enterprise) expects to contribute approximately $384 million to its
non-U.S. pension plans and approximately $37 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants and approximately $46 million to cover benefit claims for HP's
post-retirement benefit plans in fiscal 2016. Subsequent to the Separation, HP Inc. expects to contribute approximately $18 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, approximately
$36 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants and approximately $43 million to cover benefit claims for HP's post-retirement benefit plans in fiscal 2016.
HP's policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities.

Estimated Future Benefits Payments

As of October 31, 2015, HP Inc. estimates that the future benefits payments for the retirement and post-retirement plans are as
follows:

Separation related activities

In advance of the Separation, HP underwent a plan-by-plan analysis in which it was determined if each plan would be assigned to
HP Inc. or Hewlett Packard Enterprise. While some pension plans transitioned in their entirety to Hewlett Packard Enterprise or remain in their entirety with HP Inc., other plans were
split into two identical plans resulting in both companies splitting the plan's assets and liabilities. As a result of these plan separations, HP Inc. will retain defined benefit plan assets of
approximately $11,930 million, of which approximately $11,077 million pertain to the U.S. defined benefit plans. The projected benefit obligation for these defined benefit plans as of
October 31, 2015 was $13,792 million, of which $12,709 million pertains to the U.S. defined benefit plans. The net funded status of these plans represents a net obligation which
is recognized on HP Inc.'s Consolidated Balance Sheets for approximately $1,862 million of which $1,632 million pertains to the U.S. defined benefit plans. In addition, HP Inc.
will retain post-retirement benefit plan assets of approximately $434 million. The projected benefit obligation for these post-retirement benefit plans as of October 31, 2015 was
approximately $598 million. The net funded status of these plans represents a net obligation which is recognized on HP Inc.'s Consolidated Balance Sheets for approximately
$164 million.

The
current Hewlett-Packard Company 401(k) Plan ("HP 401(k) Plan") will remain with HP Inc. A new 401(k) Plan was created for the employees of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and the
respective balances were transferred after the Separation.

Note 5: Stock-Based Compensation

HP's stock-based compensation plans include incentive compensation plans and an employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP").

In
connection with the Separation, the Board of Directors approved amendments to certain outstanding long-term incentive awards on July 29, 2015. The amendments provided for the
accelerated vesting on September 17, 2015 of certain stock-based awards that were otherwise scheduled to vest between September 18, 2015 and December 31, 2015. The pre-tax
stock-based compensation expense due to the acceleration was approximately $76 million in fiscal year 2015.

Cash
received from option exercises and purchases under the Hewlett-Packard Company 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2011 ESPP") was $0.4 billion in fiscal 2015,
$0.3 billion in fiscal 2014 and $0.3 billion in fiscal 2013. The benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $75 million,
$51 million and $13 million, respectively.

Note 5: Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans

HP's stock-based incentive compensation plans include equity plans adopted in 2004 and 2000, as amended ("principal equity plans"), as
well as various equity plans assumed through acquisitions under which stock-based awards are outstanding. Stock-based awards granted from the principal equity plans include restricted stock awards,
stock options and performance-based awards. Employees meeting certain employment qualifications are eligible to receive stock-based awards.

Restricted
stock awards are non-vested stock awards that may include grants of restricted stock or restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards and cash-settled awards are generally
subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. Such awards generally vest one to three
years from the date of grant. During the vesting period, ownership of the restricted stock cannot be transferred. Restricted stock has the same dividend and voting rights as common stock and is
considered to be issued and outstanding upon grant. The dividends paid on restricted stock are non-forfeitable. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares
underlying restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. However, shares underlying restricted stock units are included in the calculation of diluted net EPS. Restricted
stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. HP expenses the fair value of restricted stock awards ratably over the period during which the
restrictions lapse.

Stock
options granted under the principal equity plans are generally non-qualified stock options, but the principal equity plans permit some options granted to qualify as incentive stock
options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Stock options generally vest over three to four years from the date of grant. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the closing price of HP's
stock on the option grant date. The majority of stock options issued by HP contain only service vesting conditions. However, starting in fiscal 2011, HP began granting performance-contingent stock
options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions prior to the expiration of the awards.

In
connection with the Separation and in accordance with the Employee Matters Agreement, HP will make certain adjustments to the exercise price and number of share-based compensation
awards with the intention of preserving the intrinsic value of the awards prior to the separation. Exercisable and non-exercisable stock options will be converted to similar awards of the entity where
the employee is working post-separation. Restricted stock unit awards and performance-contingent awards will be adjusted to provide holders restricted stock units and performance-contingent awards in
the company that employs such employee following the separation.

In
fiscal 2015, HP assumed approximately 8 million shares of restricted stock units through acquisition with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $33 per share.

The
total grant date fair value of restricted stock awards vested in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $593 million, $234 million and $247 million, respectively, net of
taxes. As of October 31, 2015, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards was $652 million, which is expected to be
recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.5 years.

Stock Options

HP utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options subject to service-based
vesting conditions. HP estimates the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation model and a lattice model as these
awards contain market conditions. The weighted-average fair value and the assumptions used to measure fair value were as follows:

(2)

For
all awards granted in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2013, expected volatility was estimated using the implied volatility derived from options
traded on HP's common stock. For awards granted in fiscal 2014, expected volatility for awards subject to service-based vesting was estimated using the implied volatility derived from options traded
on HP's common stock, whereas for performance- contingent awards, expected volatility was estimated using the historical volatility of HP's common stock.

(3)

The
risk-free interest rate was estimated based on the yield on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues.

(4)

The
expected dividend yield represents a constant dividend yield applied for the duration of the expected term of the award.

(5)

For
awards subject to service-based vesting, the expected term was estimated using historical exercise and post-vesting termination patterns;
and for performance-contingent awards, the expected term represents an output from the lattice model.

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that option holders would have received had all option holders exercised their options on
the last trading day of fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013. The aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between HP's closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal year and the exercise price,
multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $214 million, $151 million and $36 million,
respectively. The total grant date fair value of options vested in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $59 million, $53 million and $64 million, respectively, net of taxes.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

HP sponsors the 2011 ESPP, pursuant to which eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of base compensation, subject to certain
income limits, to purchase shares of HP's common stock.

Pursuant
to the terms of the 2011 ESPP, employees purchase stock under the 2011 ESPP at a price equal to 95% of HP's closing stock price on the purchase date. No stock-based compensation
expense was recorded in connection with those purchases because the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met.

Shares Reserved

Shares available for future grant and shares reserved for future issuance under the stock-based incentive compensation plans and the

the
extent that HP plans to reinvest earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the United States, U.S. taxes have not been provided on those indefinitely reinvested earnings.

In
fiscal 2015, HP recorded $1.6 billion of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. These amounts included $1.8 billion tax benefit due to a release of
valuation allowances pertaining to certain U.S. deferred tax assets and $486 million tax charge to record valuation allowances on certain foreign deferred tax assets, both related to legal
entities within the ES business, $394 million of tax charges for adjustments to uncertain tax positions and the settlement of tax audit matters, inclusive of $449 million of tax charges related
to pension transfers, and $3 million of tax charges for various provision to return adjustments and other adjustments. In addition, HP recorded $639 million of net tax benefits on
restructuring, separation-related, and other charges and a tax benefit of $47 million arising from the retroactive research and development credit resulting from the Tax Increase Prevention Act of
2014, which was signed into law in December 2014.

In
fiscal 2014, HP recorded $53 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year.

In
fiscal 2013, HP recorded $471 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year. These amounts included $214 million of net increases to valuation
allowances, $406 million of tax charges for adjustments to uncertain tax positions and the settlement of tax audit matters and $47 million of tax charges for various prior period
adjustments. In addition, HP recorded $146 million of tax benefits from adjustments to prior year foreign income tax accruals and a tax benefit of $50 million arising from the
retroactive research and development credit resulting from the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law in January 2013.

As
a result of certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in
some cases is wholly exempt from taxes, through 2026. The gross income tax benefits attributable to these actions and investments were estimated to be $581 million ($0.32 diluted net EPS) in
fiscal year 2015, $1.2 billion ($0.61 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2014, $827 million ($0.42 diluted net EPS) in fiscal year 2013. The gross income tax benefits were offset partially by
accruals of U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings, among other factors.

Up
to $3.0 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.9 billion of HP's unrecognized tax benefits at October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, would affect HP's
effective tax rate if realized. The $5.8 billion increase in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits for the year ended October 31, 2015 primarily relates to the timing of intercompany
royalty income recognition which does not affect HP's effective tax rate.

HP
recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. HP had accrued $357 million and $254 million for interest and penalties as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

HP
engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. HP does not expect complete resolution of any U.S. Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") audit cycle within the next 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next
12 months, including issues involving transfer pricing and other matters. Accordingly, HP believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by an
amount up to $144 million within the next 12 months.

HP
is subject to income tax in the U.S. and approximately 105 other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. In addition, HP is
subject to numerous ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The IRS is conducting an audit of HP's 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 income tax returns. HP has received from
the IRS Notices of Deficiency for its fiscal 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005 tax years, and Revenue Agent Reports ("RAR") for its fiscal 2001, 2002, 2006, 2007 and 2008 tax years. The proposed IRS
adjustments for these tax years would, if sustained, reduce the benefits of tax refund claims HP has filed for net operating loss carrybacks to earlier fiscal years and tax credit carryforwards to
subsequent years by approximately $445 million. In addition, HP expects the IRS to issue an RAR for 2009 through 2011 relating to certain tax positions taken on the filed tax returns, including
matters related to the U.S. taxation of certain intercompany loans. While the RAR may be material in amount, HP



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 6: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)

believes
it has valid positions supporting its tax returns and, if necessary, it will vigorously defend such matters.

HP
has filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court regarding certain proposed IRS adjustments regarding tax years 1999 through 2003 and is continuing to contest additional adjustments
proposed by the IRS for other tax years. The U.S. Tax Court ruled in May 2012 against HP regarding one of the IRS adjustments for which HP has filed a formal Notice of Appeal. The Court proceedings
are expected to begin in fiscal 2016.

Pre-acquisition
tax years of HP's U.S. group of subsidiaries providing enterprise services through 2004 have been audited by the IRS, and all proposed adjustments have been resolved.
RARs have been received for tax years 2005, 2006, 2007 and the short period ended August 26, 2008, proposing total tax deficiencies of $274 million. HP is contesting certain of these
issues.

The
IRS began an audit in fiscal 2013 of the 2010 income tax return for HP's U.S. group of subsidiaries providing enterprise services, and has issued an RAR for the short period ended
October 31, 2008 and the period ending October 31, 2009 proposing a total tax deficiency of $62 million. HP is contesting certain of these issues.

With
respect to major state and foreign tax jurisdictions, HP is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 1999. HP is subject to a foreign tax audit concerning
an intercompany transaction for fiscal 2009. The relevant taxing authority has proposed an assessment of approximately $733 million. HP is contesting this proposed assessment.

HP
believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits. HP regularly assesses
the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of HP's tax provision. HP adjusts its uncertain tax positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings,
advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. However, income tax audits are inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that HP will
accurately predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in the Provision for taxes and
therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could have a material impact on net income or cash flows.

HP
has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $47.2 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of October 31, 2015 because HP
intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If HP were to distribute these earnings, foreign tax credits may become available under current law to reduce the resulting U.S.
income tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. HP will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of its
non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. federal and withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and HP determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax
or cash management reasons.

Excess
tax benefits of $64 million were recorded resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs in fiscal 2015. Tax deficits of
approximately $43 million and $149 million were recorded as a result of employee stock program activity and exercise of employee stock options, as a decrease in stockholders' equity in
fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively.

HP
periodically engages in intercompany advanced royalty payment and licensing arrangements that may result in advance payments between subsidiaries in different tax jurisdictions. When
the local



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Note 6: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)

tax
treatment of the intercompany licensing arrangements differs from U.S. GAAP treatment, deferred taxes are recognized. During fiscal 2015, HP executed an intercompany advanced royalty
payment arrangement resulting in advanced payments of $8.8 billion, while during fiscal 2014, HP executed a multi-year intercompany licensing arrangement and an intercompany advanced royalty
payment arrangement which resulted in combined advanced payments of $11.5 billion, the result of which was the recognition of zero net U.S. deferred tax assets in fiscal 2015 and
$1.7 billion in fiscal 2014. In these transactions, the payments were received in the U.S. from a foreign consolidated affiliate, with a deferral of intercompany revenues over the term of the
arrangements, approximately 5 years and 15 years, respectively. Intercompany royalty revenue and the amortization expense related to the licensing rights are eliminated in consolidation.

Separation
costs are expenses associated with HP's plan to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies. HP recorded a deferred tax asset on these costs and expenses as they
were incurred through fiscal 2015. HP expects a portion of these deferred tax assets associated with separation costs and expenses will be non-deductible expenses, at the time the Separation is
executed. Furthermore, HP has also concluded on the legal form of the Separation and in May 2015 announced that Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be the spinnee in the U.S. Accordingly, during the
second half of fiscal 2015, HP implemented certain internal reorganizations of, and transactions among, its wholly owned subsidiaries and operating activities in preparation for the legal form of
Separation. As a result, HP recorded adjustments to certain deferred and prepaid tax assets as well as income tax liabilities reflecting the impact of separation related activities.

As
of October 31, 2015, HP had $971 million, $6.1 billion and $26.8 billion of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively.
Amounts included in each of these respective totals begin to expire in fiscal 2023, 2016 and 2016, respectively. HP also has capital loss carryforwards of approximately $26 million which will
expire in fiscal 2020. HP has provided a valuation allowance of $106 million and $8.2 billion related to the state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively.

As
of October 31, 2015, HP had recorded deferred tax assets for various tax credit carryforwards as follows:

Gross
deferred tax assets at October 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were reduced by valuation allowances of $9.9 billion, $11.9 billion and $11.4 billion,
respectively. Total valuation allowance decreased by $2 billion in fiscal 2015 associated with the reversal of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets in the U.S., and increased by
$525 million in fiscal 2014, associated primarily with foreign net operating losses.

Tax Matters Agreement and Other Income Tax Matters

In connection with the Separation, HP entered into a Tax Matters Agreement (the "Tax Matters Agreement") with Hewlett Packard
Enterprise effective on November 1, 2015 that governs the rights and obligations of HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise for certain pre-Separation tax liabilities. The Tax Matters Agreement
provides that HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise will share certain pre-Separation income tax liabilities that arise from adjustments made by tax authorities to HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise's U.S.
and certain non-U.S. income tax returns. In certain jurisdictions HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise have joint and several liability for past income tax liabilities and accordingly, HP could be
legally liable under applicable tax law for such liabilities and required to make additional tax payments.

In
addition, if the distribution of Hewlett Packard Enterprise's common shares to the HP stockholders is determined to be taxable, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP would share the tax
liability equally, unless the taxability of the distribution is the direct result of action taken by either Hewlett Packard
Enterprise or HP subsequent to the distribution in which case the party causing the distribution to be taxable would be responsible for any taxes imposed on the distribution.

Upon
completion of the Separation on November 1, 2015, HP recorded a net payable to Hewlett Packard Enterprise of $390 million for certain tax liabilities that Hewlett
Packard Enterprise is joint and severally liable for, but for which it is indemnified by HP under the Tax Matters Agreement. The actual amount that HP may be obligated to pay could vary depending upon
the outcome of certain unresolved tax matters, which may not be resolved for several years.

expense was $3.1 billion, $3.3 billion and $3.2 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change in gross property, plant and equipment
was due primarily to purchases of $3.7 billion, which were partially offset by sales and retirements totaling $2.9 billion and unfavorable currency impacts of $0.5 billion.
Accumulated depreciation associated with the assets sold and retired in fiscal 2015 was $2.5 billion.

Credit Quality Indicators

Due to the homogenous nature of its leasing transactions, HP manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and
monitoring credit risk. Credit risk is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising HP's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic
regions. HP evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease inception and monitors that credit quality over the term of a transaction. HP assigns risk ratings to each lease based on the
creditworthiness of the obligor and other variables that augment or mitigate the inherent credit risk of a particular transaction. Such variables include the underlying value and liquidity of the
collateral, the essential use of the equipment, the term of the lease, and the inclusion of credit enhancements, such as guarantees, letters of credit or security deposits. HP classifies accounts as
high risk when it considers the financing receivable to be impaired or when management believes there is a significant near-term risk of impairment.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts for financing receivables is comprised of a general reserve and a specific reserve. HP maintains
general reserve percentages on a regional basis and bases such percentages on several factors, including consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in the overall
weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio, current economic conditions and information derived from competitive benchmarking. HP excludes accounts evaluated as part of the specific reserve from
the general reserve analysis. HP establishes a specific reserve for financing receivables with identified exposures, such as customer defaults, bankruptcy or other events, that make it unlikely HP
will recover its investment. For individually evaluated receivables, HP determines the expected cash flow for the receivable, which includes consideration of estimated proceeds from disposition of the
collateral, and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts where a loss is considered probable, HP records a specific reserve. HP generally writes off
a receivable or records a specific reserve when a receivable becomes 180 days past due, or sooner if HP determines that the receivable is not collectible.

Non-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables

HP considers a financing receivable to be past due when the minimum payment is not received by the contractually specified due date. HP
generally places financing receivables on non-accrual status, which is suspension of interest accrual, and considers such receivables to be non-performing at the earlier of the time at which full
payment of principal and interest becomes doubtful or the receivable becomes 90 days past due. Subsequently, HP may recognize revenue on non-accrual financing receivables as payments are
received, which is on a cash basis, if HP deems the recorded financing receivable to be fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of the recorded financing
receivable, all cash receipts are applied to the carrying amount of the financing receivable, which is the cost recovery method. In certain circumstances, such as when HP deems a delinquency to be of
an administrative nature, financing receivables may accrue interest
after becoming 90 days past due. The non-accrual status of a financing receivable may not impact a customer's risk rating. After all of a customer's delinquent principal and interest balances
are settled, HP may return the related financing receivable to accrual status.

Note 9: Acquisitions and Divestitures

Acquisitions

In fiscal 2015, HP completed five acquisitions. The purchase price allocation for these acquisitions as set forth in the table below
reflects various preliminary fair value estimates and analyses, including preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists, which are subject to change within the measurement period as
valuations are finalized. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocation that are not yet finalized relate to the fair values of certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired, the
valuation of intangible assets acquired, certain legal matters, income and non-income based taxes, and residual goodwill. HP expects to continue to obtain information to assist it in determining the
fair value of the net assets acquired at the acquisition date during the measurement period. Measurement period adjustments that HP determines to be material will be applied retrospectively to the
period of acquisition in HP's Consolidated Financial Statements and, depending on the nature of the adjustments, other periods subsequent to the period of acquisition could also be affected.

Pro
forma results of operations for these acquisitions have not been presented because they are not material to HP's consolidated results of operations, either individually or in the
aggregate. Goodwill,
which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net tangible and intangible assets acquired, is not deductible for tax purposes.

The
following table presents the aggregate purchase price allocation, including those items that are still preliminary allocations, for HP's acquisitions in fiscal 2015:

Note 9: Acquisitions and Divestitures (Continued)

Acquisition of Aruba

HP's largest acquisition in fiscal 2015 was the acquisition of Aruba, which was completed in May 2015. Aruba is a leading provider of
next-generation network access solutions for the mobile enterprise. HP reported the financial results of Aruba's business in the Networking business unit within the EG segment. The acquisition date
fair value of consideration of $2.8 billion consisted of cash paid for outstanding common stock, vested in-the-money stock awards and the estimated fair value of earned unvested stock awards
assumed by HP. In connection with this acquisition, HP recorded approximately $1.8 billion of goodwill, $643 million of intangible assets and $153 million of IPR&D. HP is
amortizing the intangible assets on a straight-line basis over an estimated weighted-average life of six years.

Acquisitions in prior year

In fiscal 2014, HP completed two acquisitions with a combined purchase price of $55 million, of which $12 million was recorded as
goodwill and $25 million was recorded as intangible assets related to these acquisitions.

Divestitures

In fiscal 2015, HP completed five divestitures which resulted in $246 million of proceeds. These divestitures included HP's sale
of its web-based photo sharing and photo printing service, Snapfish. Snapfish was previously reported within the Consumer Hardware business unit within the Printing segment. Additionally, HP completed
the sales of its LiveVault and iManage businesses, which were previously reported within the Software segment. The gains associated with these divestitures were included in Selling, general and
administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

In
May 2015, HP and Tsinghua Holdings jointly announced a partnership that will bring together the Chinese enterprise technology assets of Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Tsinghua
University to create a Chinese provider of technology infrastructure. Under the definitive agreement, Tsinghua Holdings' subsidiary, Unisplendour Corporation, will purchase 51% of a new business
called H3C, comprising Hewlett Packard Enterprise's current H3C Technologies and China-based server, storage and technology services businesses, for approximately $2.3 billion. Hewlett Packard
Enterprise China will maintain 100% ownership of its existing China-based ES, Aruba, Software and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Helion Cloud businesses. Once the transaction closes, the new H3C will be
the exclusive provider for Hewlett Packard Enterprise's server, storage and networking portfolio, as well as Hewlett Packard Enterprise's exclusive hardware support services provider in China,
customized for that market. The transaction will be a part of Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a result of the Separation and is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, subject to
regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

In
October 2015, HP signed a definitive agreement to sell the TippingPoint business to Trend Micro International for approximately $300 million. TippingPoint is a provider of
next-generation intrusion prevention systems and related network security solutions. The results of TippingPoint were recorded within the Software segment. The transaction will be a part of Hewlett
Packard Enterprise as a result of the Separation and is expected to close during the first quarter of fiscal 2016, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions.

Goodwill
is net of accumulated impairment losses of $14.5 billion. Of that amount, $8.0 billion relates to the ES segment,
$5.7 billion relates to Software, and the remaining $0.8 billion relates to Corporate Investments.

(2)

In
connection with the Separation, effective at the beginning of its fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, HP implemented an organizational change
which resulted in the transfer of the marketing optimization solutions business from the Software segment to the Commercial Hardware business unit within the Printing segment. As a result, HP
reclassified $512 million of goodwill related to the marketing optimization solutions business from the Software segment to the Printing segment. The reclassification has been reflected
retrospectively for all periods presented above.

(3)

Goodwill
relates to the MphasiS Limited reporting unit.

In
fiscal 2015, HP recorded approximately $2.0 billion of goodwill related to acquisitions based on its preliminary fair value estimates of the assets acquired. Goodwill
adjustments primarily relate to the allocation of goodwill to the LiveVault, Snapfish and iManage businesses, which were sold during the period.

Goodwill Impairments

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. As of October 31, 2015, our reporting units are consistent with
the reportable segments identified in Note 2, except for ES, which includes two reporting units: MphasiS Limited; and the remainder of ES. Based on the results of its annual impairment tests,
HP determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of August 1, 2015. There were no goodwill impairments in fiscal 2014 and 2013.

In
fiscal 2015, the decrease in gross intangible assets was due primarily to $936 million of intangible assets that became fully amortized, partially offset by intangible assets
and IPR&D resulting from HP's acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Aruba. Fully amortized intangible assets have been eliminated from gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization during
the period.

In
fiscal 2014, $855 million of intangible assets became fully amortized and have been eliminated from gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization. HP also eliminated
gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization related to the sale of a portfolio of intellectual property ("IP") in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.

Note 11: Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date.

Fair Value Hierarchy

HP uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data
such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions
market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1—Quoted

Level 2—Quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active,
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.

inputs for the asset or liability.

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs.

There
were no transfers between the fair value hierarchy during fiscal 2015 and 2014.

Valuation Techniques

Cash Equivalents and Investments:    HP holds time deposits, money market funds, mutual funds, other debt securities
primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds, and common stock and equivalents. HP values cash equivalents and equity investments using quoted market prices, alternative
pricing sources, including NAV, or models utilizing market observable inputs. The fair value of debt investments was based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using inputs primarily
derived from or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable market data.

Derivative
Instruments:    HP uses forward contracts, interest rate and total return swaps, and option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
HP uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based
observable inputs, including interest rate curves, HP and counterparty credit risk, foreign currency rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and interest rates. See Note 12 for a
further discussion of HP's use of derivative instruments.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 11: Fair Value (Continued)

Other Fair Value Disclosures

Short- and Long-Term Debt:    HP estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an expected present value technique,
which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities, and considering its own credit
risk. The portion of HP's debt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an amount equal to the debt's carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the
fair value of the hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. The estimated fair value of HP's short- and long-term debt approximated its carrying amount of
$24.7 billion at October 31, 2015. The estimated fair value of HP's short- and long-term debt was $19.9 billion at October 31, 2014, compared to its carrying amount of
$19.5 billion at that date. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, short- and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Other
Financial Instruments:    For the balance of HP's financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in other
accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these other financial instruments would be
classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Non-Marketable
Equity Investments and Non-Financial Assets:    Elements within HP's non-marketable equity investments and non-financial assets, such as goodwill, intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value in the period an impairment charge is recognized. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would
generally be classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In fiscal 2015, HP determined that it would exit certain data centers. HP conducted an analysis of the respective asset group to
determine if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. As a result of this assessment, HP recorded a $136 million impairment charge to Impairment of data center assets on the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

All
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2015 and 2014, the
carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Interest income related to cash, cash equivalents and debt securities was approximately
$129 million in fiscal 2015, $136 million in fiscal 2014 and $148 million in fiscal 2013. Time deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside the U.S. as of
October 31, 2015 and 2014. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investments may not be representative of values that will be realized in the future.

The
gross unrealized loss as of October 31, 2015 and 2014 was due primarily to decline in the fair value of a debt security of $13 million and $14 million,
respectively, that has been in a continuous loss position for more than twelve months. HP does not intend to sell this debt security, and it is not likely that HP will be required to sell this debt
security prior to the recovery of the amortized cost.

Equity
securities in privately held companies include cost basis and equity method investments and are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. These amounted to $58 million and $97 million at October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Derivative Instruments

HP is a global company exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of its
business. As part of its risk management strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, interest rate swaps, total return swaps and, at times, option contracts to hedge certain
foreign currency, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. HP's objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts
used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting the fair value of assets and liabilities. HP does not have any leveraged derivatives and does not use derivative contracts for
speculative purposes. HP may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation ("net
investment hedges"). Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, HP categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. HP recognizes all derivative instruments at fair
value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. HP classifies cash flows from its derivative programs with the activities that correspond to the underlying hedged items in the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows.

As
a result of its use of derivative instruments, HP is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk,
HP has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their credit ratings and other factors, and HP maintains dollar risk limits
that correspond to each financial institution's credit rating and other factors. HP's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk include reviewing and establishing limits for
credit exposure and periodically reassessing the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Master netting agreements further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting HP to net amounts
due from HP to counterparty against amounts due to HP from the same counterparty under certain conditions.

To
further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties, HP has collateral security agreements that allow HP to hold collateral from, or require HP to post collateral to, counterparties
when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit
ratings of HP and its counterparties. If HP's or the counterparty's credit rating falls below a specified credit rating, either party has the right to request full collateralization of the
derivatives' net liability

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 12: Financial Instruments (Continued)

position.
Collateral is generally posted within two business days. The fair value of derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $173 million and
$38 million at October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, all of which were fully collateralized within two business days.

Under
HP's derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting HP that results in the surviving entity being
rated below a specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect HP's financial position or cash flows as of October 31, 2015 and 2014.

Fair Value Hedges

HP issues long-term debt primarily in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. HP may enter into fair value
hedges, such as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar London
Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")-based floating interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, HP may
choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial.

When
investing in fixed-rate instruments, HP may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may designate these swaps as
fair value hedges.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, HP recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in
the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.

Cash Flow Hedges

HP uses forward contracts and at times, option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency
exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. HP's
foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within twelve months; however, hedges related to longer term procurement arrangements extend several years and forward contracts associated with
sales-type and direct-financing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term, which typically range from two to five years.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, HP initially records changes in fair value for the effective portion of the derivative instrument in
Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during
which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. HP reports the effective portion of its cash flow hedges in the same financial statement line item as changes in the fair value of the hedged
item.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 12: Financial Instruments (Continued)

Net Investment Hedges

HP uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is the local currency. HP records the effective portion of such derivative instruments together with changes in the fair value of the hedged items in Cumulative translation adjustment as a
separate component of stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other Derivatives

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign
currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. HP also uses total return swaps and, to a lesser extent, interest rate swaps, based on equity or fixed income indices, to hedge its executive deferred
compensation plan liability.

For
derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, HP recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of
the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.

Hedge Effectiveness

For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the
hedged item with the change in fair value of the derivative. For foreign currency options and forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness by
comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. HP recognizes any ineffective
portion of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the same period in which ineffectiveness occurs. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period they arise.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Senior Notes

On October 9, 2015, Hewlett Packard Enterprise completed the offering and pricing of nine series of senior unsecured notes (the
"Notes") in an aggregate principal amount of $14.6 billion which includes $14.0 billion of fixed rate notes and $600 million of floating rate notes. The interest on fixed rate notes are payable
semiannually and the interest on floating-rate notes are payable quarterly. The issuance costs of $54 million are included in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are being amortized to
Interest expense over the term of the Notes. The Notes were initially guaranteed by HP. The guarantee was automatically and unconditionally released upon the completion of the Separation on
November 1, 2015.

Concurrent
with the issuance of the Notes, Hewlett Packard Enterprise entered into interest rate swaps to reduce the exposure of $9.5 billion of aggregate principal amount of fixed rate
senior notes to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving LIBOR-based floating interest expense.

Extinguishment of Debt

On September 30, 2015, HP commenced cash tender offers ("the Tender Offers") to purchase up to $8.85 billion outstanding
debt securities in two separate offers, for (i) any and all of its outstanding 2.20% notes due December 2015, 2.65% notes due June 2016, 3.00% notes due September 2016, 3.30% notes due December
2016, 5.40% notes due March 2017, 2.60% notes due September 2017 and 5.50% notes due March 2018 and (ii) up to $2.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of its outstanding 2.75% notes
due January 2019, Floating Rate notes due January 2019, 3.75% notes due December 2020, 4.30% notes due June 2021, 4.375% notes due September 2021, 4.650% notes due December 2021, 4.050% notes due
September 2022 and 6.00% notes due September 2041. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, HP redeemed and repaid $6.6 billion and this early extinguishment of debt resulted in a loss of
$167 million, net of realized gains from fair value hedges, which was recorded as "Interest and other, net" on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. On November 4, 2015, HP incrementally
redeemed and repaid a total of $2.1 billion fixed-rate U.S. Dollar Global Notes which resulted in a loss of $66 million, net of realized gains from fair value hedges.

Commercial Paper

HP's Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of up to $16.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper by
HP. HP's subsidiaries are authorized to issue up to an additional $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper. HP maintains two commercial paper

programs,
and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. HP's U.S. program provides for the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of
$16.0 billion. HP's euro commercial paper program provides for the issuance of commercial paper outside of the U.S. denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds up to a maximum
aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion or the equivalent in those alternative currencies. The combined aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding under those programs at any
one time cannot exceed the $16.0 billion authorized by HP's Board of Directors. The HP subsidiary's euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Programme provides for the issuance of
commercial paper in various currencies of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $500 million.

On
November 1, 2015, HP's Board of Directors authorized to borrow for the use and benefit of HP and HP's subsidiaries, by the issuance of commercial paper or through the execution
of promissory notes, loan agreements, letters of credit, agreements for lines of credit or overdraft facilities. The total outstanding principal balance of such commercial paper issued by shall not
exceed $4.0 billion or the equivalent in foreign currencies.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise Commercial Paper and Credit Agreements

Hewlett Packard Enterprise's Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of up to $4.0 billion in aggregate principal amount
of commercial paper. Hewlett Packard Enterprise maintains two commercial paper programs: (i) a U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper program under which, Hewlett Packard Enterprise is
permitted to have issued and outstanding up to $4.0 billion unsecured commercial paper notes (the "U.S. Commercial Paper Program"), and (ii) a euro-commercial paper program under which,
Hewlett Packard Enterprise is permitted to have issued and outstanding up to $3 billion unsecured commercial paper notes issued outside the U.S., (the "euro Commercial Paper Program"). The
combined aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding under those programs at any one time cannot exceed $4.0 billion. The Hewlett Packard Enterprise's subsidiaries has been
authorized to issue up to an additional $500 million in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper. The Hewlett Packard Enterprise subsidiary's euro Commercial Paper / Certificate of
Deposit Program, which provides for the issuance of commercial paper in various currencies of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $500 million.

Credit Agreements

As of October 31, 2015, HP maintained senior unsecured committed credit facilities primarily to support the issuance of
commercial paper. HP had a $3.0 billion five-year credit facility that would have expired in March 2017 and a $4.5 billion five-year credit facility that would have expired in April
2019. Both facilities supported the U.S. commercial paper program and the euro commercial paper program. Commitment fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit facilities varied
based on HP's external credit ratings. HP's ability to have an outstanding U.S. commercial paper balance that exceeded the $7.5 billion supported by these credit facilities was subject to a
number of factors, including liquidity conditions and business performance. In addition, the $3.0 billion five-year credit facility had been amended in September 2012 to permit borrowings in
euros and British pounds, with the amounts available in euros and British pounds being limited to the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2.2 billion and $300 million, respectively.



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 13: Borrowings (Continued)

On
November 1, 2015, the $3.0 billion five-year credit facility was cancelled and HP amended the $4.5 billion five-year credit facility to a revolving credit facility
providing for a senior, unsecured revolving credit facility with aggregate lending commitments of $4.0 billion. Commitments under the revolving credit facility will be available until the
period ending on April 2, 2019. Funds to be borrowed under this revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes.

Term Loan Agreement

On April 30, 2015, HP entered into a credit agreement that provides for a senior unsecured delayed, multiple draw term loan facility in
the aggregate principal amount of $5.0 billion. Funds borrowed under this agreement were used for general corporate purposes, including to pay expenses associated with HP's proposed plan to separate
into two independent publicly traded companies and matters related to the acquisition of Aruba. In fiscal 2015, HP borrowed and repaid $3.5 billion under this credit agreement. Along with the
repayment in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, this term loan agreement has terminated upon the Separation.

Note 15: Net Earnings Per Share

HP calculates basic net EPS using net earnings and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net EPS includes any dilutive effect of
restricted stock awards, stock options, performance-based awards and shares purchased under the 2011 ESPP.

The
reconciliations of the numerators and denominators of each of the basic and diluted net EPS calculations were as follows:

outstanding. For fiscal 2014 and 2013, the net earnings allocated to participating securities were not significant.

HP
excludes options and restricted stock units where the assumed proceeds exceed the average market price from the calculation of diluted net
EPS, because their effect would be anti-dilutive. The assumed proceeds of an option include the sum of its exercise price, average unrecognized compensation cost and excess tax benefits. The assumed
proceeds of a restricted stock unit include the sum of its average unrecognized compensation cost and excess tax benefits.

Note 16: Litigation and Contingencies

HP is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of IP, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and
environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP accrues a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss
can be reasonably estimated. HP believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2015, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been
incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in HP's financial statements. HP reviews these matters at least quarterly and adjusts its accruals to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,
rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Based on its experience, HP believes that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters
discussed below are not a meaningful indicator of HP's potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, HP believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal
matters pending against it. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies.

Under
the separation and distribution agreement, HP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise agreed to cooperate with each other in managing litigation and environmental matters related to both
companies' businesses. The separation and distribution agreement also included provisions that assign to each company responsibility for managing pending and future litigation and environmental
matters related to the general corporate matters of HP arising prior to the Separation.

Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations

Copyright Levies

.

As described below, proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving HP in certain European
Union ("EU") member countries, including litigation in Germany, Belgium and Austria, seeking to impose or modify levies upon equipment (such as multi-function devices ("MFDs"), PCs and printers) and
alleging that these devices enable producing private copies of copyrighted materials. Descriptions of some of the ongoing proceedings are included below. The levies are generally based upon the number
of products sold and the per-product amounts of the levies, which vary. Some EU member countries that do not yet have levies on digital devices are expected to implement similar legislation to enable
them to extend existing levy schemes, while some other EU member countries have phased out levies or are expected to limit the scope of levy schemes and applicability in the digital hardware
environment, particularly with respect to sales to business users. HP, other companies and various industry associations have opposed the extension of levies to the digital environment and have
advocated alternative models of compensation to rights holders.

VerwertungsGesellschaft
Wort ("VG Wort"), a collection agency representing certain copyright holders, instituted legal proceedings against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court seeking to
impose levies on



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

printers.
On December 22, 2004, the court held that HP is liable for payments regarding all printers using ASCII code sold in Germany but did not determine the amount payable per unit. HP
appealed this decision in January 2005 to the Stuttgart Court of Appeals. On May 11, 2005, the Stuttgart Court of
Appeals issued a decision confirming that levies are due. On June 6, 2005, HP filed an appeal to the German Federal Supreme Court in Karlsruhe. On December 6, 2007, the German Federal
Supreme Court issued a judgment that printers are not subject to levies under existing law. VG Wort appealed the decision by filing a claim with the German Federal Constitutional Court challenging the
ruling that printers are not subject to levies. On September 21, 2010, the Constitutional Court published a decision holding that the German Federal Supreme Court erred by not referring
questions on interpretation of German copyright law to the Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") and therefore revoked the German Federal Supreme Court decision and remitted the matter to
it. On July 21, 2011, the German Federal Supreme Court stayed the proceedings and referred several questions to the CJEU with regard to the interpretation of the European Copyright Directive.
On June 27, 2013, the CJEU issued its decision responding to those questions. The German Federal Supreme Court subsequently scheduled a joint hearing on this matter with other cases relating to
reprographic levies on printers and PCs that was held on October 31, 2013. The German Federal Supreme Court issued a decision on July 3, 2014 partially granting the claim of VG Wort. The
German Federal Supreme Court decision provides that levies are due where the printer is used with a PC to make permitted reprographic copies in a single process under the control of the same person,
but no levies are due on a printer for reprographic copies made with a "scanner-PC-printer" product chain. The case has been remitted to the Stuttgart Civil Court to assess the amount to be paid per
printer unit. The industry association BITKOM and VG Wort signed a settlement agreement defining the levies due on printers sold in Germany from 2001-2007. HP opted to join the settlement agreement on
August 10, 2015 and paid €68.2 million (approximately $72.0 million) in levies, excluding value added taxes, due as a result of such settlement by
November 30, 2015.

In
September 2003, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against Fujitsu Technology Solutions GmbH ("Fujitsu") in the Munich Civil Court in Munich, Germany seeking to impose levies on PCs. This
is an industry test case in Germany, and HP has agreed not to object to the delay if VG Wort sues HP for such levies on PCs following a final decision against Fujitsu. On December 23, 2004, the
Munich Civil Court held that PCs are subject to a levy and that Fujitsu must pay €12 plus compound interest for each PC sold in Germany since March 2001. Fujitsu appealed this decision
in January 2005 to the Munich Court of Appeals. On December 15, 2005, the Munich Court of Appeals affirmed the Munich Civil Court decision. Fujitsu filed an appeal with the German Federal
Supreme Court in February 2006. On October 2, 2008, the German Federal Supreme Court issued a judgment that PCs were not photocopiers within the meaning of the German copyright law that was in
effect until December 31, 2007 and, therefore, were not subject to the levies on photocopiers established by that law. VG Wort subsequently filed a claim with the German Federal Constitutional
Court challenging that ruling. In January 2011, the Constitutional Court published a decision holding that the German Federal Supreme Court decision was inconsistent with the German Constitution and
revoking the German Federal Supreme Court decision. The Constitutional Court also remitted the matter to the German Federal Supreme Court for further action. On July 21, 2011, the German
Federal Supreme Court stayed the proceedings and referred several questions to the CJEU with regard to the interpretation of the European Copyright Directive. On June 27, 2013, the CJEU issued
its decision responding to those questions. The German Federal Supreme Court subsequently scheduled a joint hearing on that matter with other cases relating to reprographic levies on printers that was
held on October 31, 2013. The



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

German
Federal Supreme Court issued a decision on July 3, 2014 partially granting the claim of VG Wort. The German Federal Supreme Court decision provides that levies are due for audio-visual
copying of standing text and pictures using a PC as the last device in a single reproduction process under the control of the same person, but no levies are due on a PC for reprographic copies made
using a "PC-printer" or a "scanner-PC-printer" chain. The case has been remitted to the Munich Court of Appeals to assess the amount to be paid per PC unit.

Reprobel,
a cooperative society with the authority to collect and distribute the remuneration for reprography to Belgian copyright holders, requested by extra-judicial means that HP
amend certain copyright levy declarations submitted for inkjet MFDs sold in Belgium from January 2005 to December 2009 to enable it to collect copyright levies calculated based on the generally higher
copying speed when the MFDs are operated in draft print mode rather than when operated in normal print mode. In March 2010, HP filed a lawsuit against Reprobel in the French-speaking chambers of the
Court of First Instance of Brussels seeking a declaratory judgment that no copyright levies are payable on sales of MFDs in Belgium or, alternatively, that copyright levies payable on such MFDs must
be assessed based on the copying speed when operated in the normal print mode set by default in the device. On November 16, 2012, the court issued a decision holding that Belgium law is not in
conformity with EU law in a number of respects and ordered that, by November 2013, Reprobel substantiate that the amounts claimed by Reprobel are commensurate with the harm resulting from legitimate
copying under the reprographic exception. HP subsequently appealed that court decision to the Courts of Appeal in Brussels seeking to confirm that the Belgian law is not in conformity with EU law and
that, if Belgian law is interpreted in a manner consistent with EU law, no payments by HP are required or, alternatively, the payments already made by HP are sufficient to comply with its obligations
under Belgian law. On October 23, 2013, the Court of Appeal in Brussels stayed the proceedings and referred several questions to the CJEU relating to whether the Belgian reprographic copyright
levies system is in conformity with EU law. The case was heard by the CJEU on January 29, 2015 and on November 12, 2015, the CJEU published its judgment providing that a national
legislation such as the Belgian one at issue in the main proceedings is incompatible with EU law in multiple legal points, as argued by HP. The Court of Appeal of Brussels now has to rule on the
litigation between HP and Reprobel following the answers provided by the CJEU.

Based
on industry opposition to the extension of levies to digital products, HP's assessments of the merits of various proceedings and HP's estimates of the number of units impacted and
the amounts of the levies, HP has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the matters described above. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters and the associated financial
impact on HP, including the number of units impacted and the amount of levies imposed, remains uncertain.

Memjet Technology Ltd. v. HP.

On August 11, 2015, Memjet Technology Ltd. ("Memjet") filed a lawsuit
against HP in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of California. The complaint alleges that HP infringes eight Memjet patents. The products accused of infringement are those that use the HP
PageWide Technology, including the OfficeJet Pro X series, OfficeJet Enterprise X series, HP
PageWide XL, wide scan printers, and printers using 4.25-inch thermal inkjet printheads, such as HP Web Presses and Photo Kiosks. On October 2, 2015, HP answered Memjet's complaint and
asserted a counter-claim against Memjet for infringement of four HP patents. The products accused of infringement include various Memjet OEM printers that incorporate Memjet's printheads and print
engines. On November 20, 2015, HP asserted three additional patents against Memjet. The patents



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

asserted
by both parties generally relate to inkjet printhead and print system technology. Both Memjet's and HP's respective complaints seek injunctive relief and monetary damages from the other party
for alleged patent infringement. On November 16, 2015, Memjet was granted an

ex parte

preliminary injunction in Germany (State Court
Munich), against HP Deutschland GmbH's sale and offers for sale of HP PageWide XL printers. Memjet's injunction request alleges that HP infringes a Memjet European patent. On
December 4, 2015, HP filed an opposition and an application to suspend enforcement of the preliminary injunction pending a court hearing and decision. On December 9, 2015, the court
denied HP's application to suspend enforcement prior to a hearing. A hearing is scheduled for January 7, 2016.

Fair Labor Standards Act Litigation.

HP is involved in several lawsuits in which the plaintiffs are seeking unpaid
overtime compensation and other damages based on allegations that various employees of Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") or HP have been misclassified as exempt employees under the Fair
Labor Standards Act (" FLSA") and/or in violation of the California Labor Code or other state laws. Those matters include the following:

•

Karlbom, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems Corporation

is
a purported wage and hour class action filed on March 16, 2009 in California Superior Court. The plaintiffs claim that EDS and HP information technology employees in the Infrastructure job
codes working in California were misclassified as exempt from overtime and wrongfully paid under the law. On October 30, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a Rule 23 state
class of all California-based EDS employees in the Infrastructure Associate, Infrastructure Analyst, Infrastructure Specialist and Infrastructure Specialist Senior job codes from March 16, 2005
through October 31, 2009 that they claim were improperly classified as exempt from overtime under state law. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise
has been assigned responsibility for this litigation.

•

Benedict v. Hewlett-Packard Company

is a purported class
action filed on January 10, 2013 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that certain technical support employees allegedly involved in installing,
maintaining and/or supporting computer software and/or hardware for HP were misclassified as exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The plaintiff has also alleged that HP violated
California law by, among other things, allegedly improperly classifying these employees as exempt. On February 13, 2014, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for conditional class
certification. On May 7, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a Rule 23 state class of certain Technical Solutions Consultants in California, Massachusetts, and Colorado that
they claim were improperly classified as exempt from overtime under state law. On July 30, 2015, the court dismissed the Technology Consultant and certain Field Technical Support Consultant
opt-ins from the conditionally certified FLSA collective action. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been assigned responsibility for this litigation.

India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings.

On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate
of Revenue Intelligence (the "DRI") issued show cause notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Ltd ("HP India"), a subsidiary of HP, seven HP India employees and one former HP India
employee alleging that HP India underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $370 million, plus penalties.
Prior to the issuance of the show cause notices, HP India deposited approximately $16 million with the DRI



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

and
agreed to post a provisional bond in exchange for the DRI's agreement to not seize HP India products and spare parts and to not interrupt the transaction of business by HP India.

On
April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and the
named individuals of approximately $386 million, of which HP India had already deposited $9 million. On December 11, 2012, HP India voluntarily deposited an additional
$10 million in connection with the products-related show cause notice. The differential duty demand is subject to interest. On April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the
parts-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HP India and certain of the named individuals of approximately $17 million, of which HP India had already
deposited $7 million. After the order, HP India deposited an additional $3 million in connection with the parts-related show cause notice so as to avoid certain penalties.

HP
India filed appeals of the Commissioner's orders before the Customs Tribunal along with applications for waiver of the pre-deposit of remaining demand amounts as a condition for
hearing the appeals. The Customs Department has also filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On
January 24, 2013, the Customs Tribunal ordered HP India to deposit an additional $24 million against the products order, which HP India deposited in March 2013. The Customs Tribunal did
not order any additional deposit to be made under the parts order. In December 2013, HP India filed applications before the Customs Tribunal seeking early hearing of the appeals as well as an
extension of the stay of deposit as to HP India and the individuals already granted until final disposition of the appeals. On February 7, 2014, the application for extension of the stay of
deposit was granted by the Customs Tribunal until disposal of the appeals. On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner's orders. The
Customs Tribunal rejected HP India's request to remand the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds. The hearings scheduled to reconvene on April 6, 2015 and again on November 3,
2015 were cancelled at the request of the Customs Tribunal. A new hearing date has not been set.

Russia GPO and Other Anti-Corruption Investigations.

The German Public Prosecutor's Office ("German PPO") has
been conducting an investigation into allegations that current and former employees of HP engaged in bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion relating to a transaction between Hewlett-Packard
ISE GmbH in Germany, a former subsidiary of HP, and the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. The approximately €35 million transaction, which was
referred to as the Russia GPO deal, spanned the years 2001 to 2006 and was for the delivery and installation of an IT network. The German PPO issued an indictment of four individuals, including
one current and two former HP employees, on charges including bribery, breach of trust and tax evasion. The German PPO also requested that HP be made an associated party to the case, and, if that
request is granted, HP would participate in any portion of the court proceedings that could ultimately bear on the question of whether HP should be subject to potential disgorgement of profits based
on the conduct of the indicted current and former employees. The Regional Court of Leipzig will determine whether the matter should be admitted to trial. The Polish Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is
also investigating potential corrupt actions by a former employee of Hewlett-Packard Polska Sp. z o.o., a former indirect subsidiary of HP, in connection with certain public-sector transactions in
Poland. HP is cooperating with these investigating agencies.

On
December 2, 2014, plaintiffs Petroleos Mexicanos and Pemex Exploracion filed a complaint against HP and HP Mexico in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of California



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

alleging
violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO Act), fraudulent concealment, tortious interference, and violations of the California Unfair Competition Law in
connection with alleged improper payments provided to Pemex officials by third-parties retained by HP Mexico. These allegations arise from the same subject-matter as a previously disclosed 2014
Non-Prosecution Agreement between HP Mexico and the DOJ and a simultaneous cease-and-desist order against HP issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). On February 9, 2015, HP
and HP Mexico filed a motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. On July 13, 2015, the court granted the motion to dismiss and gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint. The
plaintiffs
filed a first amended complaint on July 31, 2015. On August 21, 2015, HP and HP Mexico filed a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint. On November 3, 2015, the parties
settled the matter for no payment and the court dismissed this case with prejudice on November 4, 2015.

ECT Proceedings.

In January 2011, the postal service of Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e
Telégrafos ("ECT"), notified an HP subsidiary in Brazil ("HP Brazil") that it had initiated administrative proceedings to consider whether to suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and
contract with ECT related to alleged improprieties in the bidding and contracting processes whereby employees of HP Brazil and employees of several other companies allegedly coordinated their bids and
fixed results for three ECT contracts in 2007 and 2008. In late July 2011, ECT notified HP Brazil it had decided to apply the penalties against HP Brazil and suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and
contract with ECT for five years, based upon the evidence before it. In August 2011, HP Brazil appealed ECT's decision. In April 2013, ECT rejected HP Brazil's appeal, and the administrative
proceedings were closed with the penalties against HP Brazil remaining in place. In parallel, in September 2011, HP Brazil filed a civil action against ECT seeking to have ECT's decision revoked. HP
Brazil also requested an injunction suspending the application of the penalties until a final ruling on the merits of the case. The court of first instance has not issued a decision on the merits of
the case, but it has denied HP Brazil's request for injunctive relief. HP Brazil appealed the denial of its request for injunctive relief to the intermediate appellate court, which issued a
preliminary ruling denying the request for injunctive relief but reducing the length of the sanctions from five to two years. HP Brazil appealed that decision and, in December 2011, obtained a ruling
staying enforcement of ECT's sanctions until a final ruling on the merits of the case. HP expects the decision to be issued in 2016 and any subsequent appeal on the merits to last several years.
Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been assigned responsibility for this litigation.

Cisco Systems.

On August 21, 2015, Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco Systems") and Cisco Systems Capital
Corporation ("Cisco Capital") filed an action in Santa Clara County Superior Court for declaratory judgment and breach of contract against HP in connection with a dispute arising out of a
third-party's termination of a services contract with HP. As part of that third-party services contract, HP separately contracted with Cisco on an agreement to utilize Cisco products and services. HP
prepaid the entire amount due Cisco through a financing arrangement with Cisco Capital. Following the termination of HP services contract with the third-party, HP no longer required Cisco's products
and services, and, accordingly, exercised its contractual termination rights under the agreement with Cisco, and requested that Cisco apply the appropriate credit toward the remaining balance owed
Cisco Capital. This lawsuit relates to the calculation of that credit under the agreement between Cisco and HP. Cisco contends that after the credit is applied, HP still owes Cisco Capital
approximately $58 million. HP contends that under a proper reading of the agreement, HP owes nothing to Cisco



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Capital,
and that Cisco owes significant amounts to HP. Pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise has been assigned responsibility for this litigation.

Stockholder Litigation.

As described below, HP is involved in various stockholder litigation matters commenced against
certain current and former HP executive officers and/or certain current and former members of HP's Board of Directors in which the plaintiffs are seeking to recover damages related to HP's allegedly
inflated stock price, certain compensation paid by HP to the defendants, other damages and/or injunctive relief:

•

A.J. Copeland v. Raymond J. Lane, et al. ("Copeland I")

is a lawsuit filed on March 7, 2011 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties
and wasted corporate assets in connection with HP's alleged violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 ("FCPA"), HP's severance payments made to Mark Hurd (a former Chairman of HP's Board
of Directors and HP's Chief Executive Officer), and HP's acquisition of 3PAR Inc. The lawsuit also alleges violations of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"Exchange Act") in connection with HP's 2010 and 2011 proxy statements. On February 8, 2012, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. On October 10, 2012, the court granted
the defendants' motion to dismiss with leave to file an amended complaint. On November 1, 2012, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint adding an unjust enrichment claim and claims that the
defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with HP's 2012 proxy statement. On December 13, 14 and 17, 2012, the defendants
moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 28, 2012, the plaintiff moved for leave to file a third amended complaint. On May 6, 2013, the court denied the motion for
leave to amend, granted the motions to dismiss with prejudice and entered judgment in the defendants' favor. On May 31, 2013, the plaintiff filed an appeal with the United States Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On October 26, 2015, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the action.

•

A.J. Copeland v. Léo Apotheker, et al. ("Copeland
II")

is a lawsuit filed on February 10, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging, among other things,
that the defendants used their control over HP and its corporate suffrage process in effectuating, directly participating in and/or aiding and abetting violations of Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder, and violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. The complaint asserts
claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, and breach of the duty of candor. The claims arise out of the circumstances at HP relating to its 2013 and 2014 proxy
statements, the departure of Mr. Hurd as Chairman of HP's Board of Directors and HP's Chief Executive Officer, alleged violations of the FCPA, and HP's acquisition of 3PAR Inc. and
Autonomy Corporation plc ("Autonomy"). On February 25, 2014, the court issued an order granting HP's administrative motion to relate

Copeland
II

to

Copeland I

. On April 8, 2014, the court granted the parties' stipulation to stay the action pending resolution of

Copeland I

by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Cement & Concrete Workers District Council Pension Fund v. Hewlett-Packard Company, et
al.

is a putative securities class action filed on August 3, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging,
among other things, that from November 13, 2007 to August 6, 2010 the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by making statements regarding HP's
Standards of Business Conduct ("SBC") that were false and misleading because Mr. Hurd, who was serving as HP's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer during that period, had been violating the
SBC and concealing his misbehavior in a manner that jeopardized his continued employment with HP. On February 7, 2013, the defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On August 9,
2013, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss with leave to amend the complaint by September 9, 2013. The plaintiff filed an amended complaint on September 9, 2013, and the
defendants moved to dismiss that complaint on October 24, 2013. On June 25, 2014, the court issued an order granting the defendants' motions to dismiss and on July 25, 2014,
plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On November 4, 2014, the plaintiff-appellant filed its opening brief in the Court of Appeals for
the Ninth Circuit. HP filed its answering brief on January 16, 2015 and the plaintiff-appellant's reply brief was filed on March 2, 2015. Oral argument has not yet been scheduled.

Autonomy-Related Legal Matters

Investigations.

As a result of the findings of an ongoing investigation, HP has provided information to the U.K. Serious
Fraud Office, the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the SEC related to the accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and misrepresentations at Autonomy that occurred prior to and in
connection with HP's acquisition of Autonomy. On November 21, 2012, DOJ representatives advised HP that they had opened an investigation relating to Autonomy. On February 6, 2013,
representatives of the U.K. Serious Fraud Office advised HP that they had also opened an investigation relating to Autonomy. On January 19, 2015, the U.K. Serious Fraud Office notified HP that
it was closing its investigation and had decided to cede jurisdiction of the investigation to the U.S. authorities. HP is cooperating with the DOJ and the SEC, whose investigations are ongoing.

Litigation.

As described below, HP is involved in various stockholder litigation relating to, among other things, its
October 2011 acquisition of Autonomy and its November 20, 2012 announcement that it recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets within its Software segment
of approximately $8.8 billion in the fourth quarter of its 2012 fiscal year and HP's statements that, based on HP's findings from an ongoing investigation, the majority of this impairment
charge related to accounting improprieties, misrepresentations to the market and disclosure failures at Autonomy that occurred prior to and in connection with HP's acquisition of Autonomy and the
impact of those improprieties, failures and misrepresentations on the expected future financial performance of
the Autonomy business over the long term. This stockholder litigation was commenced against, among others, certain current and former HP executive officers, certain current and former members of HP's
Board of Directors and certain advisors to HP. The plaintiffs in these litigation matters are seeking to recover certain compensation paid by HP to the defendants and/or other damages. These matters
include the following:

•

In re HP Securities Litigation

consists of two
consolidated putative class actions filed on November 26 and 30, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

California
alleging, among other things, that from August 19, 2011 to November 20, 2012, the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by concealing
material information and making false statements related to HP's acquisition of Autonomy and the financial performance of HP's enterprise services business. On May 3, 2013, the lead plaintiff
filed a consolidated complaint alleging that, during that same period, all of the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 10b-5(b) by concealing
material information and making false statements related to HP's acquisition of Autonomy and that certain defendants violated SEC Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) by engaging in a "scheme" to
defraud investors. On July 2, 2013, HP filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. On November 26, 2013, the court granted in part and denied in part HP's motion to dismiss, allowing claims
to proceed against HP and Margaret C. Whitman based on alleged statements and/or omissions made on or after May 23, 2012. The court dismissed all of the plaintiff's claims that were based on
alleged statements and/or omissions made between August 19, 2011 and May 22, 2012. The lead plaintiff filed a motion for class certification on November 4, 2014 and, on
December 15, 2014, the defendants filed their opposition to the motion. On June 9, 2015, HP entered into a settlement agreement with the lead plaintiff in the consolidated securities
class action. Under the terms of the settlement, HP, through its insurers, will contribute $100 million to a settlement fund that will be used to compensate persons who purchased HP's shares
during the period from August 19, 2011 through November 20, 2012. No individual is contributing to the settlement. HP and its current and former officers, directors, and advisors will be
released from any Autonomy-related securities claims as part of the settlement. On July 17, 2015, the court granted preliminary approval to the settlement. On November 13, 2015, the
court granted final approval to the settlement.

•

In re Hewlett-Packard Shareholder Derivative Litigation

(the "Federal Court Derivative Action") consists of seven consolidated lawsuits filed beginning on November 26, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California
alleging, among other things, that the defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act by concealing material information and making false statements related to HP's
acquisition of Autonomy and the financial performance of HP's enterprise services business. The lawsuits also allege that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties, wasted corporate assets and
were unjustly enriched in connection with HP's acquisition of Autonomy and by causing HP to repurchase its own stock at allegedly inflated prices between August 2011 and October 2012. One lawsuit
further alleges that certain individual defendants engaged in or assisted insider trading and thereby breached their fiduciary duties, were unjustly enriched and violated Sections 25402 and
25403 of the California Corporations Code. On May 3, 2013, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint alleging, among other things, that the defendants concealed material information and
made false statements related to HP's acquisition of Autonomy and Autonomy's Intelligent Data Operating Layer technology and thereby violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act,
breached their fiduciary duties, engaged in "abuse of control" over HP, corporate waste and were unjustly enriched. The litigation was stayed until June 2014. The lead plaintiff filed a stipulation of
proposed settlement on June 30, 2014. The court declined to grant preliminary approval to this settlement, and, on December 19, 2014, also declined to grant preliminary approval to a
revised version of the settlement. On January 22, 2015, the lead plaintiff moved for preliminary approval of a further revised version of the settlement. On March 13, 2015, the court
issued an order granting preliminary approval to the settlement. On July 24, 2015, the court held a hearing to

entertain
any remaining objections to the settlement and decide whether to grant final approval of the settlement. On July 30, 2015, the court granted final approval to the settlement and
denied all remaining objections to the settlement. Certain objectors to the settlement appealed the court's final approval order.

•

Vincent Ho v. Margaret C. Whitman, et al.

is a lawsuit
filed on January 22, 2013 in California Superior Court alleging, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets in connection with HP's
acquisition of Autonomy and by causing HP to repurchase its own stock at allegedly inflated prices between August 2011 and October 2012. On April 22, 2013, the court stayed the lawsuit pending
resolution of the Federal Court Derivative Action. Two additional derivative actions,

James Gould v. Margaret C. Whitman, et al.

and

Leroy Noel v. Margaret C. Whitman, et
al

., were filed in California Superior Court on July 26, 2013 and August 16, 2013, respectively,
containing substantially similar allegations and seeking substantially similar relief. Those actions were also stayed pending resolution of the Federal Court Derivative Action. All the claims asserted
in the these matters (other than those asserted against Michael Lynch, Sushovan Hussain, the former chief financial officer of Autonomy, and Deloitte UK and Qatalyst) have been released under the
terms of the settlement of the Federal Court Derivative Action. Following final approval of the settlement of the Federal Court Derivative Action, the

Ho

matter was dismissed with prejudice on
August 13, 2015.

•

Cook v. Whitman, et al.

is a lawsuit filed on
March 18, 2014 in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties and wasted corporate assets in connection with HP's acquisition
of Autonomy. On May 15, 2014, HP moved to dismiss or stay the

Cook

matter. On July 22, 2014, the Delaware Chancery Court stayed the motion
pending the United States District Court's hearing on preliminary approval of the proposed settlement in the Federal Court Derivative Action. All the claims asserted in the these matters (other than
those asserted against Michael Lynch, Sushovan Hussain, the former chief financial officer of Autonomy, and Deloitte UK and Qatalyst) have been released under the terms of the settlement of the
Federal Court Derivative Action. Following final approval of the Federal Court Derivative Settlement, the

Cook

matter was dismissed on August 19,
2015.

•

Autonomy Corporation Limited v. Michael Lynch and Sushovan
Hussain.

On April 17, 2015, four HP subsidiaries (Autonomy Corporation Limited, Hewlett Packard Vision BV, Autonomy Systems, Limited, and
Autonomy, Inc.) initiated civil proceedings in the U.K. High Court of Justice against two members of Autonomy's former management, Michael Lynch and Sushovan Hussain. The Particulars of Claim
seek damages in excess of $5 billion from Messrs. Lynch and Hussain for breach of their fiduciary duties by causing Autonomy group companies to engage in improper transactions and
accounting practices. On October 1, 2015, Messrs. Lynch and Hussain filed their defenses. Mr. Lynch also filed a counterclaim against Autonomy Corporation Limited seeking
$160 million in damages, among other things, for alleged misstatements regarding Lynch. The HP subsidiary claimants will have an opportunity to file a response to the defenses and
asserted counterclaim.

•

In re HP ERISA Litigation

consists of three consolidated
putative class actions filed beginning on December 6, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging, among other things, that from August 18,
2011 to November 22, 2012, the defendants breached their fiduciary obligations to HP's 401(k) Plan and its participants and thereby violated

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

Sections 404(a)(1)
and 405(a) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, by concealing negative information regarding the financial performance of Autonomy and HP's
enterprise services business and by failing to restrict participants from investing in HP stock. On August 16, 2013, HP filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit. On March 31, 2014, the
court granted HP's motion to dismiss this action with leave to amend. On July 16, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint containing substantially similar allegations and seeking
substantially similar relief as the first amended complaint. On June 15, 2015, the court granted HP's motion to dismiss the second amended complaint in its entirety and denied plaintiffs leave
to file another amended complaint. On July 2, 2015, plaintiffs have appealed the court's order to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

Environmental

HP's operations and products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental
protection, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content
of HP's products and the recycling, treatment and disposal of those products. In particular, HP faces increasing complexity in its product design and procurement operations as it adjusts to new and
future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of its products, their safe use, and the energy consumption associated with those products, including requirements relating to
climate change. HP is also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for
specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). HP could incur substantial costs, its products
could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if its products become non-compliant with
environmental laws. HP's potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of costs to
comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.

HP
is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
("CERCLA"), known as "Superfund," or state laws similar to CERCLA, and may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by private parties for contribution towards clean-up costs.
HP is also conducting environmental investigations or remediations at several current or former operating sites pursuant to administrative orders or consent agreements with state environmental
agencies.

Note 17: Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties

Guarantees

In the ordinary course of business, HP may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, customers and other parties pursuant
to which HP has guaranteed the performance obligations of third parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, HP would be obligated to
perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified



HP INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 17: Guarantees, Indemnifications and Warranties (Continued)

triggering
event occurs as defined by the guarantee. HP believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material guarantee is remote.

HP
has entered into service contracts with certain of its clients that are supported by financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of HP's non-performance
under the contract or failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, HP could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract. HP
believes the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets under these arrangements is remote.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify a third party to such
arrangement from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for
example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. HP also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of IP infringement made by third parties arising from the
vendors' and customers' use of HP's software products and services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to
these indemnifications have been immaterial.

Under
the separation and distribution agreement, HP agreed to indemnify Hewlett Packard Enterprise, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and
employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to HP as part of the Separation. Hewlett Packard Enterprise
similarly agreed to indemnify HP, each of its subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers and employees from and against all liabilities relating to, arising out of or resulting
from, among other matters, the liabilities allocated to Hewlett Packard Enterprise as part of the Separation. HP expects Hewlett Packard Enterprise to fully perform under the terms of the separation
and distribution agreement.

For
information on the cross-indemnifications related to the tax matter agreements and litigations effective upon the Separation on November 1, 2015, see Note 6 "Taxes on
Earnings" and Note 16 "Litigation and Contingencies", respectively.

Warranties

HP accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. HP engages in extensive product quality programs
and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, contractual warranty terms,
repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failures outside of HP's baseline
experience, affect the estimated warranty obligation.

Note 18: Commitments

Lease Commitments

HP leases certain real and personal property under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain leases require HP to pay property taxes,
insurance and routine maintenance and include renewal options and escalation clauses. Rent expense was approximately $1.0 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Property
under capital leases was comprised primarily of equipment and furniture. Capital lease assets included in Property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were
$207 million and $229 million as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Accumulated depreciation on the property under capital leases was $187 million and
$207 million as of October 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange

Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to HP, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be disclosed in our SEC reports
(i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to HP's management, including our
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

During
the fourth qurter of fiscal 2015, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we
completed our preparations and implementation for a series of changes to our information technology environment, which includes our financial reporting systems, to support the separate financial
reporting requirements for HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during fiscal 2015 that have materially affected,
