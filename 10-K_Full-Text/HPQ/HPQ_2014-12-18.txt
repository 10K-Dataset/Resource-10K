HP
was incorporated in 1947 under the laws of the state of California as the successor to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard. Effective in May 1998, we
changed our state of incorporation from California to Delaware.

October 2014 Announcement of HP Separation Transaction

On October 6, 2014, we announced plans to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies: one comprising our enterprise
technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses, which will conduct business as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and one that will comprise our printing and personal systems
businesses, which will conduct business as HP Inc. The separation is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, obtaining final approval from HP's Board of Directors, receipt of a
favorable opinion and/or rulings with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction for federal income tax purposes and the effectiveness of a Form 10 filing with the SEC. The separation is
expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015. Under the separation plan, HP shareholders will own shares of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. The following chart provides an
overview of the planned separation and segment revenues of the respective businesses based on HP's fiscal 2014 results, excluding Corporate Investments and intercompany eliminations.

HP Products and Services; Segment Information

We offer one of the IT industry's broadest portfolios of products and services that bring together infrastructure, software, and
services through innovation to enable our customers to create value and solve business problems. As consumers and enterprises shift the way technology is created, delivered, consumed and paid for,
they are demanding a foundation that will support much greater agility, lower cost, facilitate quicker time-to-market, and provide a higher degree of accessibility by end-users to that technology. We
design our solutions to provide that foundation, particularly in the areas of security, cloud, mobility and big data, by leveraging the breadth of our offerings and the strengths and capabilities of
our individual business units.

Our
operations are organized into seven business segments: Personal Systems; Printing; the Enterprise Group ("EG"); Enterprise Services ("ES"); Software; HP Financial Services ("HPFS");
and Corporate Investments. In each of the past three fiscal years, notebook personal computers ("PCs"), printing supplies, infrastructure technology outsourcing services, desktop PCs and industry
standard servers each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue.

The
Personal Systems segment and the Printing segment are structured beneath a broader Printing and Personal Systems Group ("PPS"). While PPS is not a reportable segment, we may provide
financial



data
aggregating the Personal Systems and Printing segments to provide a supplementary view of its business.

A
summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our segments along with a description of our fiscal 2014 organizational realignments can be found in Note 2
to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. A discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, which
is incorporated herein by reference.

Printing and Personal Systems Group

The mission of PPS is to leverage the respective strengths of the Personal Systems segment and the Printing segment by creating a
unified business that is customer-focused and poised to capitalize on rapidly shifting industry trends. Each of the business segments within PPS is described in detail below.

Corporate Investments

Corporate Investments includes HP Labs and certain cloud-related business incubation projects among others.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We manage our business and report our financial results based on the business segments described above. Our customers are organized by
consumer and commercial groups, and purchases of HP products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by HP or indirectly through a variety of partners,
including:

•

retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or Internet stores;

•

resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted
customer groups;

•

distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers;

•

original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") that integrate our products and services with their own products and services,
and sell the integrated solution;

•

independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling
our products and services to clients purchasing their products;

•

systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often partner with us to
extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and

•

advisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems integration work, and
typically partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services.

The
mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market
conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage, in addition to identifying efficiencies and
productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses. While each of our business segments manages the execution of its own
go-to-market and distribution strategy, our business segments also collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate. For example, we typically assign an account manager,
generally from EG or ES, to manage relationships across our business with large enterprise customers. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For
other customers and for consumers, PPS typically manages direct online sales as well as channel relationships with retailers, while our business segments collaborate to manage relationships with
commercial resellers targeting SMBs where appropriate.

Manufacturing and Materials

We utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers ("OMs") around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. The use of
OMs is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for HP-designed products. We use multiple OMs to maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing
processes. In some circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under the HP brand. In addition to our use of OMs, we currently manufacture a limited number of finished
products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.



We utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to
maximize manufacturing and logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units to match a customer's particular
hardware and software customization requirements. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory
holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers.

We
purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate
sources of supply are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines, LaserJet supplies, certain customized parts and parts for products with short life cycles
(although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a disruption). We are dependent upon Intel and AMD as suppliers of x86 processors and Microsoft for various
software products; however, we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our
competitors. See "Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly," in Item 1A, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

Like
other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand
requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from
multiple sources. Frequently, we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt
production. We also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of
supply. See "Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly," in Item 1A, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

International

Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis
for both consumer and enterprise customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset
geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. In addition, we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products
and sales models that target developing countries. In this regard, we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth.

A
summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property, plant and equipment is set forth in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8,
which is incorporated herein by reference. Approximately 65% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2014 came from outside the United States ("U.S.").

For
a discussion of risks attendant to HP's international operations, see "Risk Factors—Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or
other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition," in Item 1A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk," in Item 7A and
Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.



Research and Development

Innovation is a key element of our culture. Our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products, services and
solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires, and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique
contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences.

HP
Labs, together with the various research and development groups within our business segments, are responsible for our research and development efforts. HP Labs is part of our
Corporate Investments segment.

Expenditures
for research and development were $3.4 billion in fiscal 2014, $3.1 billion in fiscal 2013 and $3.4 billion in fiscal 2012. We anticipate that we will
continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products and services to maintain and enhance our
competitive position.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see "Risk Factors—If we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop,
manufacture and market products, services and solutions that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer," in Item 1A, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

Patents

Our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or
where obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At October 31, 2014, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 34,000 patents, which represents a decrease over
the number of patents in our portfolio at the end of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012. This decrease is attributable, in part, to the sale of a portfolio of mobile computing intellectual property ("IP") in
January 2014.

Patents
generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our
patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive
differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and
development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to HP as a whole or to any of HP's business segments.

In
addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license IP from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses, and other rights,
under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to IP rights, see "Risk Factors—Our revenue, cost of sales, and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the IP
rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their IP rights," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to our diverse products and services portfolio,
including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not
material to an understanding of our overall business.



Seasonality

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our
products and services experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales are
often weaker in the summer months and consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market
anticipation of seasonal trends. See
"Risk Factors—Our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by

Competition

We encounter strong competition in all areas of our business activity. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance,
price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security,
availability of application software and internet infrastructure offerings.

The
markets for each of our business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly
growing firms. Most product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete effectively
on the basis of the factors listed above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and often market their products under
their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will be critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to continue to adjust
prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.

We
have a broad technology portfolio spanning personal computing and other access devices, imaging and printing-related products and services, enterprise IT infrastructure products and
solutions, multi-vendor customer services and IT management software and solutions. We are the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments.

The
competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below:

Personal Systems.

The markets in which Personal Systems operates are highly competitive and are characterized by price competition and
inventory
obsolescence. The decline in the PC market and the ongoing shift among customers to mobility products has further intensified competition in the PC market. Our primary competitors are Lenovo Group
Limited ("Lenovo"), Dell Inc. ("Dell"), Acer Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Apple Inc., Toshiba Corporation and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. ("Samsung"). In
particular regions, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or "white box" manufacturers. Our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio, our
innovation and research and development capabilities, our brand and procurement leverage, our ability to cross-sell our portfolio of offerings, our extensive service and
support offerings and the accessibility of our products through a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.

Printing.

The markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive. Printing's key customer segments each face
competitive
market pressures in pricing and the introduction of new products. Our primary competitors include Canon U.S.A., Inc., Lexmark International, Inc., Xerox Corporation Ltd., Seiko Epson
Corporation, The Ricoh Company Ltd., Samsung and Brother Industries, Ltd. In addition, independent suppliers offer refill and remanufactured alternatives for HP original inkjet and toner
supplies, which are often available for lower prices but generally offer lower print quality and reliability. Other competitors also have



developed
and marketed new compatible cartridges for HP's laser and inkjet products, particularly outside of the U.S. where IP protection is inadequate or ineffective. Our competitive advantages
include our comprehensive solutions for the home, office and publishing environments, our innovation and research and development capabilities, our brand, and the accessibility of our products through
a broad-based distribution strategy from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.

Enterprise Group.

EG operates in the highly competitive enterprise technology infrastructure market that is characterized by rapid and
ongoing
technological innovation and price competition. Our primary competitors include technology vendors such as International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Dell, EMC Corporation ("EMC"), Cisco
Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), Lenovo, Oracle Corporation ("Oracle"), Fujitsu Limited ("Fujitsu"), Inspur, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., NetApp, Inc., Hitachi Ltd., Juniper
Networks, Inc., Arista Networks, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., VMware, Microsoft, Google Inc., Rackspace Inc., and
Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"). In certain regions, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or "white-box" manufacturers. Our strategy is to deliver
superior products, high-value technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our infrastructure, software and services capabilities. Our competitive advantages
include our broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong IP portfolio and research and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem.

Enterprise Services.

ES competes in the IT services, consulting and integration, infrastructure technology outsourcing, business process
outsourcing
and application service markets. Our primary competitors include IBM Global Services, Computer Sciences Corporation, systems integration firms such as
Accenture plc. and offshore companies such as Fujitsu and India-based competitors Wipro Limited, Infosys Limited and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. We also compete with other traditional
hardware providers, such as Dell, which are increasingly offering services to support their products, new players in emerging areas like cloud such as Amazon, and smaller local players. Many of our
competitors offer a wide range of global services, and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition. ES teams with many companies to offer services, and those arrangements allow us to
extend our reach and augment our capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our deep technology expertise, especially in complex multi-country, multi-vendor and/or multi-language environments,
differentiated IP, our strong track record of collaboration with clients and partners, and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global resources on platforms from
SAP AG ("SAP"), Oracle and Microsoft, among others.

Software.

The markets in which Software operates are fueled by rapidly changing customer requirements and technologies. We design and
develop
enterprise IT management software in competition with IBM, CA Technologies, Inc., VMware, BMC Software, Inc. and others. Our big data solutions, which include data analytics, information
governance and digital marketing offerings incorporating both structured and unstructured data, compete with products from companies like Adobe Systems Inc., IBM, EMC, Open Text Corporation,
Oracle and Symantec Corporation. We also deliver enterprise security/risk intelligence solutions that compete with products from EMC, IBM, Cisco and Intel. As customers are becoming increasingly
comfortable with newer delivery mechanisms such as SaaS, we are facing competition from smaller, less traditional competitors, particularly for customers with smaller IT organizations. Our
differentiation lies in the breadth and depth of our software and services portfolio and the scope of our market coverage.

HP Financial Services.

In our financing solution business, our competitors are captive financing companies, mainly IBM Global Financing,
 as well as
banks and other financial institutions. We believe our competitive advantage in this business over banks and other financial institutions is our ability to deliver flexible investment solutions and
expertise that help customers and partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs.



For
a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors, see "Risk Factors—Competitive pressures could harm our revenue, gross margin and prospects," in
Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Environment

Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including
laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial
costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.

Many
of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use, including laws regulating the manufacture
and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. Some of our products also are, or may in the future be, subject to requirements
applicable to their energy consumption. In addition, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical
and materials composition of our products, their safe use, and their energy efficiency, including requirements relating to climate change. We are also subject to legislation in an increasing number of
jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered
products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). In the event our products become non-compliant with these laws, our products could be restricted from entering certain
jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions, including fines.

Our
operations and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties relating to
climate change. As these laws, regulations, treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially face market
access limitations or other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those requirements, and we
are collaborating with industry, business groups and governments to find and promote ways that HP technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance with related laws,
regulations and treaties.

We
are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of
our business. We meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services.

A
liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when we consider it probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be
reasonably estimated. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future
environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows or financial
condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to these environmental factors, see "Risk Factors—Unforeseen environmental costs could adversely affect our business and results of
operations," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. In addition, for a discussion of our environmental contingencies see



Note 15
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is also incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

The following discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking statements. These risk factors may be important for understanding any
statement in this Form 10-K or elsewhere. The following information should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplemental Data" of this Form 10-K.

Because
of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our results of operations, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and
historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

If we are unsuccessful at addressing our business challenges, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected and our ability to invest in and grow our
business could be limited.

We are in the process of addressing many challenges facing our business. One set of challenges relates to dynamic and accelerating
market trends, such as the decline in the PC market, the growth of multi-architecture devices running competing operating systems, the market shift towards tablets within mobility, the market shift to
cloud-related infrastructure, software, and services, and the growth in software-as-a-service business models. Another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major
competitors are expanding their product and service offerings with integrated products and solutions; our business-specific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas
and are going after new markets; our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and business models; and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors
in others. A third set of challenges relates to business model and go-to-market execution. In addition, we are facing a series of significant macroeconomic challenges, including weakness across many
geographic regions, particularly in the United States, Central Eastern Europe and Russia, and certain countries and businesses in Asia. We may experience delays in the anticipated timing of activities
related to these efforts and higher than expected or unanticipated execution costs. In addition, we are vulnerable to increased risks associated with these efforts given our large portfolio of
businesses, the broad range of geographic regions in which we and our customers and partners operate, and the integration of acquired businesses. If we do not succeed in these efforts, or if these
efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, which could limit our ability to invest in and grow our business.

In
May 2012, we announced a company-wide restructuring plan. The restructuring plan includes both voluntary early retirement programs and non-voluntary workforce reductions. Significant
risks associated with these actions that may impair our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or that may otherwise harm our business include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce
reductions in highly regulated locations outside of the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia, decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of
employees. In addition, our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these actions within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions. These
estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we
experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.

Competitive pressures could harm our revenue, gross margin and prospects.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors may target
our key market segments. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our
products, account relationships, customer training, service and support,



security,
availability of application software, and internet infrastructure offerings. If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of
those criteria, our results of operations and prospects could be harmed.

We
have a large portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across all of those businesses while competing with companies that have much smaller portfolios or specialize in one
or more of these product lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing
resources available to them than our businesses that compete against them. Industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors
in the markets in which we compete, and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers.

Companies
with whom we have alliances in some areas may be competitors in other areas. In addition, companies with whom we have alliances also may acquire or form alliances with our
competitors, which could reduce their business with us. If we are unable to effectively manage these complicated relationships with alliance partners, our cash flows and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

We
face aggressive price competition for our products and services and, as a result, we may have to continue lowering the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive,
while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin. In addition, competitors who have a greater presence in some of the lower-cost markets in which we compete may be able to
offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.

Because
our business model is based on providing innovative and high-quality products, we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our
competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and, therefore, our profitability could be
adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain
areas, which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects.

Even
if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry or market segment or contains
technology that is becoming obsolete. For example, our Storage business unit is experiencing the effects of a market
transition towards converged products and solutions, which has led to a decline in demand for our traditional storage products. In addition, the performance of our Business Critical Systems business
unit has been affected by the decline in demand for UNIX servers and concerns about the development of new versions of software to support our Itanium-based products. Revenue and margins also could
decline due to increased competition from other types of products. For example, growing demand for an increasing array of mobile computing devices and the development of cloud-based solutions has
reduced demand for some of our existing hardware products. In addition, refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of HP's LaserJet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with our printing supplies
business.

If we cannot successfully execute on our strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market products, services and solutions that meet customer requirements for
innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer.

Our long-term strategy is focused on leveraging our portfolio of hardware, software and services as we adapt to a changing and hybrid
model of IT delivery and consumption driven by the growing adoption of cloud computing and increased demand for integrated IT solutions. To successfully execute



on
this strategy, we need to continue evolving our focus towards the delivery of integrated IT solutions for our customers and to continue to invest and expand into cloud computing, security, big data
and mobility. Any failure to successfully execute this strategy, including any failure to invest sufficiently in strategic growth areas, could adversely affect our business, results of operation and
financial results.

The
process of developing new high-technology products, software, services and solutions and enhancing existing hardware and software products, services and solutions is complex, costly
and uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. For
example, as the transition to an environment characterized by cloud-based computing and software being delivered as a service progresses, we must continue to successfully develop and deploy
cloud-based solutions for our customers. We must make long-term investments, develop or obtain, and protect, appropriate intellectual property, and commit significant research and development and
other resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products, services and solutions. In addition, after we develop a product, we must be able to
manufacture appropriate volumes quickly while also managing costs and preserving margins. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and configurations that meet
customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so within a given product's life cycle or at all. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product, service or solution
could result in us not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position.

In
the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products, services and solutions, including defects in our engineering, design and
manufacturing processes and unsatisfactory performance under service contracts, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products and unsatisfactory performance or even malicious
acts by third-party contractors or subcontractors or the employees of those contractors or subcontractors. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and
engage in product testing to determine the causes of problems and to develop and implement appropriate solutions. However, the products, services and solutions that we offer are complex, and our
regular testing and quality control efforts may not be effective in controlling or detecting all quality issues or errata, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third-parties.
If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or "patch") to address quality issues with our products, we may delay shipment to customers, which would
delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results. Addressing quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs,
adversely affecting our profits. If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products or are dissatisfied with our services or solutions, our results of operations could be adversely
affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect
our brand and reputation, which could, in turn, adversely affect our results of operations.

Our plan to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies is subject to various risks and uncertainties and may not be completed in accordance with the expected
plans or anticipated timeline, or at all, and will involve significant time and expense, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.

On October 6, 2014, we announced plans to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies. The separation, which is
currently targeted to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015, is subject to approval by our Board of Directors of the final terms of the separation and market, regulatory and certain other conditions.
Unanticipated developments, including changes in the competitive conditions of Hewlett-Packard Enterprise's and HP Inc.'s respective markets, possible delays in obtaining various tax opinions
or rulings, regulatory approvals or clearances, the uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in executing the separation, could delay or prevent the



completion
of the proposed separation, or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are different or less favorable than expected.

We
have established a Separation Management Office tasked with driving the separation process. We expect that the process of completing the proposed separation will be time-consuming and
involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we currently anticipate and may not yield a discernible benefit if the separation is not completed. Executing the
proposed separation will require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could adversely affect our business, financial results and results of operations. We may
also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees during the pendency of the separation and following its completion, which could harm our businesses.

The separation may not achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits.

We may not realize some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational, marketing or other benefits from the separation.
As independent publicly-traded companies, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. will be smaller, less diversified companies with a narrower business focus and may be more vulnerable to
changing market conditions, which could materially and adversely affect their respective business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, there can be no assurance that the combined
value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies will be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.

The proposed separation may result in disruptions to, and negatively impact our relationships with, our customers and other business partners.

Uncertainty related to the proposed separation may lead customers and other parties with which we currently do business or may do
business in the future to terminate or attempt to negotiate changes in existing business relationships, or consider entering into business relationships with parties other than us. These disruptions
could have a material and adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The effect of such disruptions could be exacerbated by any delays in the
completion of the separation.

The separation could result in substantial tax liability.

We intend to obtain an opinion of outside counsel to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the separation will
qualify, for both HP and its stockholders, as a reorganization within the meaning of Sections 368(a)(1)(D) and 355 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. In addition, we intend
to obtain a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") and/or one or more opinions of outside counsel regarding certain matters impacting the U.S. federal income tax treatment
of the separation for HP and certain related transactions as transactions that are generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The
opinions of outside counsel and any IRS private letter ruling will be based, among other things, on various factual assumptions we have authorized and representations we have made to outside counsel
or the IRS. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on the opinions and/or IRS private letter ruling may be affected. An opinion of outside
counsel represents their legal judgment but is not binding on the IRS or any court. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the conclusions reflected in the opinions or
that a court would not sustain such a challenge. In addition, we may incur certain tax costs in connection with the separation, including non-U.S. tax expense resulting from separations in multiple
non-U.S. jurisdictions that do not legally provide for tax-free separations, which may be material.



Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin and expenses.

Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for technology hardware, software and
services in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and in
increased expenses and difficulty in managing inventory levels. For example, we are continuing to experience macroeconomic weakness across many geographic regions, particularly in the Europe, the
Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") region, China and other high-growth markets. The U.S. federal government spending cuts that went into effect on March 1, 2013 may further reduce demand for our
products, services and solutions from organizations that receive funding from the U.S. government and could negatively affect macroeconomic conditions in the United States, which could further reduce
demand for our products, services and solutions. Economic weakness and uncertainty may adversely affect demand for our products, services and solutions, may result in increased expenses due to higher
allowances for doubtful accounts and potential goodwill and asset impairment charges, and may make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross margin, cash flows and
expenses.

We
also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross margin declines in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures and
increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that, as a result of competitive pricing pressures or other
factors, we are unable to pass on to our customers. In addition, our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment, parts or components from our suppliers—and our
suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit.

Economic
weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or any
significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times of
market volatility and disruption. Poor financial performance of asset markets combined with lower interest rates and the adverse effects of fluctuating currency exchange rates could lead to higher
pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Interest and other expenses could vary materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates,
costs of hedging activities and the fair value of derivative instruments. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses.

The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable.

Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will
likely be different in future periods than our current results. Our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or reductions in IT spending could have a material
adverse effect on demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenue. In addition, revenue declines in some of our businesses, particularly our services
businesses, may affect revenue in our other businesses as we may lose cross-selling opportunities. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product,
service, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. Competition, lawsuits, investigations and other risks affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on
our overall gross margin and profitability. Certain segments have a higher fixed cost structure and more variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and
may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis. In addition, newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with
entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and



maintaining
the operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, industry shifts, competitive pressures, commoditization of
products, seasonal rebates, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given
period, which may lead to adjustments to our operations. Moreover, our efforts to address the challenges facing our business could increase the level of variability in our financial results because
the rate at which we are able to realize the benefits from those efforts may vary from period to period.

If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margins and profitability could suffer.

We use a variety of distribution methods to sell our products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and both
direct and indirect sales to enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our
products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the delivery model
for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability. Other distribution risks are described below.

•

Our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of
our channel partners were to weaken.

Our
results of operations may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels, the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or the
loss of retail shelf space. Moreover, some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions, including
economic weakness and industry consolidation. Many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures. Considerable trade
receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could experience
disruptions in distribution, if our distributors' financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken.

•

Our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors.

We
must manage inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues. Distributors may increase orders during periods of
product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and
the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues, and therefore make
forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our
willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to
price our products effectively.

We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly.

Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services, as well as our suppliers' ability
to deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices and in time for us to meet critical schedules. Given the wide variety



of
systems, products and services that we offer, the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are located around the world, and the long lead times required to manufacture,
assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems could arise in production, planning, and inventory management that could seriously harm us. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize
the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and resource intensive than expected. Other supplier problems that we could face include
component shortages, excess supply, risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers, and risks related to our relationships with single source
suppliers, as described below.

•

Shortages.

Occasionally we may experience a shortage of,
or a delay in receiving, certain components as a result of strong demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets, disputes
with suppliers (some of whom are also customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new
suppliers. For example, our PC business relies heavily upon OMs to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those OMs to fulfill demand for
our PC products. HP represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these OMs, and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by HP with a particular OM could adversely
affect the operations and financial condition of the OM and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that OM. If shortages or delays persist, the price of certain components may
increase, and we may be exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build
products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose time-sensitive
sales, incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to reengineer some products or services
offerings, which could result in further costs and delays.

•

Oversupply.

In order to secure components for the
provision of products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components strategically in
advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply
could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our gross margin.

•

Contractual terms.

As a result of binding price or
purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond
to changing market conditions. If we commit to purchasing components or services for prices in excess of the then-current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to
components or services at lower prices, our gross margin could suffer, and we could incur additional charges relating to inventory obsolescence. In addition, many of our competitors obtain products or
components from the same OMs and suppliers that we utilize. Our competitors may obtain better pricing, more favorable contractual terms and conditions, and more favorable allocations of
products and components during periods of limited supply, and our ability to engage in relationships with certain OMs and suppliers could be limited. The practice employed by our PC business of
purchasing product components and transferring those components to its OMs may create large supplier receivables with the OMs that, depending on the financial condition of the OMs, may
create collectibility risks. In addition, certain of our OMs and suppliers may decide to discontinue conducting business with us. Any of these actions by our competitors, OMs or
suppliers could adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition.



•

Contingent workers.

We also rely on third-party suppliers
for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims
relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent
workers. Our ability to manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.

•

Single source suppliers.

Our use of single source
suppliers for certain components could exacerbate any supplier issues. We obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other
considerations. For example, we rely on Intel to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our PCs, workstations and servers and AMD to provide us with a sufficient supply of
processors for other products. Some of those processors are customized for our products. New products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only one source initially until we
have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers. Replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers may be subject to capacity
constraints or other output limitations. For some components, such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from Intel, alternative sources either may not exist or may be
unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under short-term
agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such
single source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of components to HP. The loss of a
single source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single
source supplier could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin and cash flows.

Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.

Our worldwide operations could be disrupted by earthquakes, telecommunications failures, power or water shortages, tsunamis, floods,
hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or catastrophic events, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The
occurrence of any of these business disruptions could result in significant losses, seriously harm our revenue, profitability and financial condition, adversely affect our competitive position,
increase our costs and expenses, and require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Our corporate headquarters and a portion of our research and development
activities are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults known for seismic activity. In
addition, six of our principal worldwide IT data centers are located in the southern United States, making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring
in that geographical area. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Shanghai,
Singapore and India. We also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in Asia to manufacture and distribute our products and in the southwestern United States to import products into the Americas
region. Our operations could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, information technology
system failures, military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general



infrastructure
of being located near locations more vulnerable to the occurrence of the aforementioned business disruptions, such as near major earthquake faults, and being consolidated in certain
geographical areas is unknown and remains uncertain.

Our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.

In some of our segments, our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's
total sales occurs towards the end of such quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes predicting revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult,
increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially
greater than orders, there may be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of
each quarter. Depending on when they occur in a quarter, developments such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions, could adversely
impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.

We
experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition. For example, sales to governments
(particularly sales to the U.S. government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal and
calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year.
European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. Moreover, to the extent
that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches.
Typically, our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.

Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses, and financial condition.

Sales outside the United States make up approximately 65% of our net revenue. In addition, an increasing portion of our business
activity is being conducted in emerging
markets, including Brazil, Russia, India and China. Our future revenue, gross margin, expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of international factors,
including:

•

ongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation,
recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;

•

longer collection cycles and financial instability among customers;

•

trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products;

•

local labor conditions and regulations, including local labor issues faced by specific HP suppliers and OMs;

•

managing a geographically dispersed workforce;

•

changes in the regulatory or legal environment;



•

differing technology standards or customer requirements;

•

import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments,
which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for
components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;

•

difficulties associated with repatriating earnings generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax
laws; and

•

fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the
transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.

The
factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we rely on manufacturers in
Taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture.

Currencies
other than the U.S. dollar, including the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan renminbi and the Japanese Yen, can have an impact on our results (expressed in U.S. dollars).
In particular, the economic uncertainties relating to European sovereign and other debt obligations and the related European financial restructuring efforts may cause the value of the euro to
fluctuate. Currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. For example, in the event that one or more European countries were to replace
the euro with another currency, our sales into such countries, or into Europe generally, would likely be adversely affected until stable exchange rates are established. Accordingly, fluctuations in
foreign currency rates, most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro, could adversely affect our revenue growth in future periods. In addition, currency variations can adversely
affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States.
We use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. The effectiveness of our hedges depends on our ability to
accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. We may incur significant
losses from our hedging activities due to factors such as volatility and currency variations. In addition, our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the
adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial condition.

In
many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us,
such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the "FCPA"). For example, as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the German Public Prosecutor's Office has been
investigating allegations that certain current and former employees of HP engaged in bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion. In addition, the Polish Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is conducting
investigations into potential FCPA violations by a former employee of an HP subsidiary in connection with certain public-sector transactions in Poland. Although we implement policies and procedures
designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in
violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.



Any failure by us to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results,
business and prospects, and the costs, expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing, completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are
different than expected.

As part of our business strategy, we may acquire companies or businesses, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances
and joint ventures and make investments to further our business (collectively, "business combination and investment transactions"). In order to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify
candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions, some of which may be large or complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired
businesses, products, services or employees. Risks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely affect our revenue, gross
margin, profitability and financial results:

•

Managing business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may
divert our attention from other business operations.

•

We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment transaction, and the
timeframe for realizing benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, advisors, suppliers or other third-parties.

•

Business combination and investment transactions have resulted, and in the future may result, in significant costs and
expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, goodwill and asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of
duplicative facilities and contracts, asset impairment charges, inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to
executive officers and key employees under retention plans.

•

Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to meet contractual obligations could make business
combination and investment transactions less profitable or unprofitable.

•

Our ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and our ability to
evaluate the results of such due diligence, is dependent upon the veracity and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by third-parties or their representatives.

•

Our due diligence process may fail to identify significant issues with the acquired company's product quality, financial
disclosures, accounting practices or internal control deficiencies.

•

The pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make
estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate accurately our costs,
timing and other matters or we may incur costs if a business combination is not consummated.

•

In order to complete a business combination and investment transaction, we may issue common stock, potentially creating
dilution for existing stockholders.

•

We may borrow to finance business combination and investment transactions, and the amount and terms of any potential
future acquisition-related or other borrowings, as well as other factors, could affect our liquidity and financial condition.

•

Our effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and business combination and investment transactions could
adversely impact our effective tax rate.



•

An announced business combination and investment transaction may not close timely or at all, which may cause our
financial results to differ from expectations in a given quarter.

•

Business combination and investment transactions may lead to litigation.

•

If we fail to identify and successfully complete and integrate business combination and investment transactions that
further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products, services and technology internally, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage.

We
have incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment
transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to
incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. For example, in our third fiscal quarter of 2012, we recorded an $8.0 billion impairment charge relating to the
goodwill associated with our enterprise services reporting unit within our former Services segment and a $1.2 billion impairment charge as a result of an asset impairment analysis of the
"Compaq" trade name acquired in 2002. In addition, in our fourth fiscal quarter of 2012, we recorded an $8.8 billion impairment charge relating to the goodwill and intangible assets associated
with Autonomy. If there are future decreases in our stock price or significant changes in the business climate or results of operations of our reporting units, we may incur additional charges, which
may include goodwill impairment or intangible asset charges.

Integration
issues are often complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business and the acquired business.
The challenges involved in integration include:

•

combining product and service offerings and entering or expanding into markets in which we are not experienced or are
developing expertise;

•

convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus,
persuading customers and distributors to not defer purchasing decisions or switch to other suppliers (which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer
uncertainty), minimizing sales force attrition and expanding and coordinating sales, marketing and distribution efforts;

•

consolidating and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various
acquisitions and integrating software code and business processes;

•

minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;

•

persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees,
engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired company's non-U.S. employees, integrating employees into HP, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring
programs;

•

coordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries,
facilities and relationships with third-parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;

•

achieving savings from supply chain integration; and

•

managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.

While
we do not currently plan to divest any of our major businesses, we do regularly evaluate the potential disposition of assets and businesses that may no longer help us meet our
objectives. When we decide to sell assets or a business, we may encounter difficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, which could delay the
achievement of our strategic



objectives.
We may also dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than we had anticipated. In addition, we may experience greater dis-synergies than expected, and the impact
of the divestiture on our revenue growth may be larger than projected. After reaching an agreement with a buyer or seller for the acquisition or disposition of a business, we are subject to
satisfaction of pre-closing conditions as well as to necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, which, if not satisfied or obtained, may prevent us from completing the
transaction. Dispositions may also involve continued financial involvement in the divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial
obligations. Under these arrangements, performance by the divested businesses or other conditions outside of our control could affect our future financial results.

Our revenue, cost of sales, and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third
parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements
with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the products and services we sell, provide or otherwise use in our operations.
However, any of our intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated, infringed or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage
of current market trends or to otherwise provide competitive advantages, either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other harm to
our competitive position. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be
unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this, too, could adversely affect our competitive position.

Because
of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by
third-parties. We may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third-parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third-parties may demand cross-licenses to
our intellectual property. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third-parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business
may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may
be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.

Third-parties
also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. For example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual
property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from companies such as HP and its customers. The number of these claims has increased in
recent periods and may continue to increase in the future. If we cannot or do not license infringed intellectual property at all or on reasonable terms, or if we are required to substitute similar
technology from another source, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that intellectual property claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend
against and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly
settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing, marketing or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an
agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable or unwilling to uphold its contractual obligations to us.



Finally,
our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition, accrual and payment of
copyright levies or similar fees. In certain countries (primarily in Europe), proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving HP in which groups representing copyright owners have sought or
are seeking to impose upon and collect from HP levies upon equipment (such as PCs, MFDs and printers) alleged to be copying devices under applicable laws. Other such groups have also sought to modify
existing levy schemes to increase the amount of the levies that can be collected from us. Other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing levy
schemes, and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices. The total amount of the copyright levies will depend on the types of
products determined to be subject to the levy, the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy, and the per unit fee for each type of product, all of which are
affected by several factors, including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving us and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries, and
could be substantial. Consequently, the ultimate impact of these copyright levies or similar fees, and our ability to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.

Our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our services business properly.

The risks that accompany our services business differ from those of our other businesses and include the
following:

•

The success of our services business is to a significant degree dependent on our ability to retain our significant
services clients and maintain or increase the level of revenues from these clients. We may lose clients due to their merger or acquisition, business failure, contract expiration or their selection of
a competing service provider or decision to in-source services. In addition, we may not be able to retain or renew relationships with our significant clients. As a result of business downturns or for
other business reasons, we are also vulnerable to reduced processing volumes from our clients, which can reduce the scope of services provided and the prices for those services. We may not be able to
replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost clients or reductions in services. In addition, our contracts may allow a client to terminate the contract for convenience, and we may not be able
to fully recover our investments in such circumstances.

•

The pricing and other terms of some of our IT services agreements, particularly our long-term IT outsourcing services
agreements, require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in
connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable, which could have an adverse
effect on the profit margin of our IT services business.

•

Some of our IT services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered
through billings over the life of the agreement. These agreements often involve the construction of new IT systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies.
Substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics, and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the
development, construction and deployment phases. Any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability, result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation,
which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our IT services business.



•

Some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study
by a mutually acceptable third-party. The benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a
peer comparison group, subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors. Generally, if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range, and the
difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client, then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing. This may result in the reduction of our rates
for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments, which could decrease the cash flows of our IT services business.

•

If we do not hire, train, motivate and effectively utilize employees with the right mix of skills and experience in the
right geographic regions to meet the needs of our services clients, our profitably could suffer. For example, if our employee utilization rate is too low, our profitability and the level of engagement
of our employees could suffer. If that utilization rate is too high, it could have an adverse effect on employee engagement and attrition and the quality of the work performed, as well as our ability
to staff projects. If we are unable to hire and retain a sufficient number of employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current demand, we might need to redeploy existing personnel, increase
our reliance on subcontractors or increase employee compensation levels, all of which could also negatively affect our profitability. In addition, if we have more employees than we need with certain
skill sets or in certain geographies, we may incur increased costs as we work to rebalance our supply of skills and resources with client demand in those geographies.

Failure to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.

Our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with
federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and
performance. Any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil
and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future
government contracting. In addition, we have in the past been, and may in the future be, subject to qui tam litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our
government contracts, which could include claims for up to treble damages. Further, any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them, regardless of its
accuracy, may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. If our customer contracts are terminated, if we are suspended or disbarred from government work, or if our
ability to compete for new contracts is adversely affected, we could suffer a reduction in expected revenue.

HP's stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of HP's stock difficult to predict.

HP's stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. Some of the factors that could affect our stock price
are:

•

speculation, coverage or sentiment in the media or the investment community about, or actual changes in, our business,
strategic position, market share, organizational structure, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost-cutting efforts, value or liquidity of our
investments, exposure to market volatility, prospects, business combination or



investment
transactions, future stock price performance, board of directors, executive team, our competitors or our industry in general;

•

the announcement of new, planned or contemplated products, services, technological innovations, acquisitions,
divestitures or other significant transactions by HP or its competitors;

•

quarterly increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin, earnings or cash flows, changes in estimates by the investment
community or financial outlook provided by HP and variations between actual and estimated financial results;

•

announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by HP's competitors and other companies in the IT industry;

•

developments relating to pending investigations, claims and disputes; and

•

the timing and amount of share repurchases by HP.

General
or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to HP's performance also may
affect the price of HP stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In
addition, as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we are involved in several securities class action litigation matters. Additional volatility in the price of our
securities could result in the filing of additional securities class action litigation matters, which could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.

Failure to maintain our credit ratings could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.

Our credit risk is evaluated by the major independent rating agencies. Two of those rating agencies, Moody's Investors Service and
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, downgraded our ratings once during fiscal 2012, and a third rating agency, Fitch Ratings, downgraded our ratings twice during that fiscal year. In addition,
Moody's Investors Service downgraded our ratings again in November 2012. Our credit ratings remain under negative outlook by Moody's Investors Service. Past downgrades have increased the cost of
borrowing under our credit facilities, have reduced market capacity for our commercial paper, and may require the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. There can be
no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our
ratings are under further review for a downgrade, may further impact us in a similar manner and may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access to capital markets.

We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of HP's Consolidated Financial Statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could
adversely affect our results of operations.

In connection with the preparation of HP's Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on
historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in
Item 7 of this report. In addition, as discussed in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal
proceedings and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are
beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could adversely affect our results of operations.



Unanticipated changes in our tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability.

We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by
the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may
disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to
determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of
audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In
addition, our effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,
changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the
carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, there are
proposals for tax legislation that have been introduced or that are being considered that could have a significant adverse effect on our tax rate, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, or our
deferred tax liabilities. Any of these changes could affect our profitability.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain, train, motivate, develop and transition qualified executives and other key
employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing and IT support positions. Identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retaining qualified executives,
engineers, skilled solutions providers in the IT support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the IT industry can be
intense. In order to attract and retain executives and other key employees in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash- and share-based
compensation. Our share-based incentive awards include stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted units, some of which contain conditions relating to HP's stock price
performance and HP's long-term financial performance that make the future value of those awards uncertain. If the anticipated value of such share-based incentive awards does not materialize, if our
share-based compensation otherwise ceases to be viewed as a valuable benefit, if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, or if we do not obtain the shareholder
approval needed to continue granting share-based incentive awards in the amounts we believe are necessary, our ability to attract, retain, and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened.
The failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations. Further, changes in our management team
may be disruptive to our business, and any failure to successfully transition and assimilate key new hires or promoted employees could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

System security risks, data protection breaches, cyber attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services
provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.

Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our
confidential information or that of third-parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and



deploy
viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and
operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third-parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly
interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities
could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that
may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.

We
manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. In addition, our outsourcing services business routinely processes,
stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent
disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us, our clients or customers, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information
or data as a result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and
potential liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers of outsourcing services or other IT solutions or incur
significant expenses in connection with our customers' system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products and services. In addition, the cost and operational
consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.

Portions
of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes
place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming, disruptive and
resource intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and respond to customer requests and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers
resulting from these disruptions could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts, wars and geopolitical uncertainties may seriously harm our business and revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts or wars (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to our business, our employees,
facilities, partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers or adversely affect our ability to manage logistics, operate our transportation and communication systems or conduct certain other
critical business operations. The potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other actual or potential conflicts
or wars have created many economic and political uncertainties. In addition, as a major multinational company with headquarters and significant operations located in the United States, actions against
or by the United States may impact our business or employees. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences of any such events, if they occur, they could result in a decrease in
demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to provide services or deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our
supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.



Unforeseen environmental costs could adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws
addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of our products and the
recycling, treatment and disposal of our products, including batteries. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and
procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those
products, climate change laws and regulations, and product take-back legislation. If we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non- compliant with
environmental laws, we could incur substantial costs or face other sanctions, which may include restrictions on our products entering certain jurisdictions. Our potential exposure includes fines and
civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage, personal injury claims and clean-up costs. Further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed
retroactively, on a joint and several basis, and without any finding of noncompliance or fault. The amount and timing of costs to comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.

Some anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.

We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or
discouraging an acquisition of HP deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions:

•

authorizing blank check preferred stock, which we could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights
superior to our common stock;

•

limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;

•

specifying that our stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and
otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;

•

requiring advance notice of proposals by our stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for
nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors; and

•

controlling the procedures for conduct of our Board of Directors and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and
removal of our directors.

These
provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or management of HP. As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to
provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of
the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.

Any
provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of HP could limit the opportunity for our
stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of HP stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for HP stock.

On
July 21, 2011, HP's Board of Directors authorized a $10.0 billion share repurchase program. HP may choose to repurchase shares when sufficient liquidity exists and the
shares are trading at a discount relative to estimated intrinsic value. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private
transactions. All share repurchases settled in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 were open market transactions. As of October 31, 2014, HP had remaining authorization of $4.9 billion for
future share repurchases.

October 2014 Announcement of HP Separation Transaction

On October 6, 2014, we announced plans to separate into two independent publicly-traded companies: one comprising our enterprise
technology infrastructure, software, services and financing businesses, which will conduct business as Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and one that will comprise our printing and personal systems
businesses, which will conduct business as HP Inc. The separation is subject to certain conditions, including, among others, obtaining final approval from HP's Board of Directors, receipt of a
favorable opinion and/or rulings with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction for federal income tax purposes and the effectiveness of a Form 10 filing with the SEC. The separation is
expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2015. Under the separation plan, HP shareholders will own shares of both Hewlett-Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. The following chart provides an
overview of the planned separation and segment revenues of the respective businesses based on HP's fiscal 2014 results, excluding Corporate Investments and intercompany eliminations.

HP
net revenue declined 0.8% (decreased 0.4% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The leading contributors to the HP net revenue decline were key
account runoff in ES and lower Printing supplies volume. Partially offsetting the net revenue decline was growth in Personal Systems from commercial personal computers ("PCs"), which experienced
growth across all product categories, along with growth in consumer notebooks. HP's gross margin increased by 0.8 percentage points in fiscal 2014 due primarily to service delivery efficiencies
and improvements in underperforming contracts in ES and favorable currency impacts from the Japanese Yen and continued cost structure improvements in Printing. We continue to experience gross margin
pressures resulting from a competitive pricing environment across our hardware portfolio. HP's operating margin was flat for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due to the gross margin increase,
improved business performance primarily in Printing, ES and Personal Systems, and lower intangible asset amortization, offset by higher restructuring charges, investments in research and development
("R&D"), and higher selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses. The increase in SG&A expenses was partially offset by gains from sales of real estate.

Our
business continues to produce significant cash flow from operations, generating $12.3 billion in fiscal 2014. Additionally, we invested $3.0 billion in property, plant
and equipment net of proceeds from sales, repurchased $2.7 billion of common stock and paid dividends of $1.2 billion to stockholders. As of October 31, 2014, cash and cash
equivalents and short- and long-term investments were $15.5 billion, representing an increase of approximately $3.0 billion from October 31, 2013.

We
continue to experience challenges that are representative of trends and uncertainties that may affect our business and results of operations. One set of challenges relates to
continuing dynamic and accelerating market trends. Another set of challenges relates to changes in the competitive landscape. Our major competitors are expanding their product and service offerings
with integrated products and

solutions,
our business-specific competitors are exerting increased competitive pressure in targeted areas and are entering new markets, our emerging competitors are introducing new technologies and
business models, and our alliance partners in some businesses are increasingly becoming our competitors in others. A third set of challenges relates to business model changes and our go-to-market
execution. The macroeconomic weakness we have experienced has moderated in some geographic regions but remains an overall challenge. A discussion of some of these challenges at the segment level is
set forth below.

•

In Personal Systems, we have been negatively impacted by the market shift towards tablet products within mobility
products, which has reduced the demand for PCs, particularly consumer notebooks. If benefits from our new product investments in this area do not materialize, we will continue to be negatively
impacted by this trend. However, the pace of the market decline is slowing with signs of stabilization and HP is gaining market share. In Personal Systems, we are maintaining our strategic focus on
profitable growth through improved market segmentation with respect to multi-OS, multi-architecture, geography, customer segments and other key attributes. In fiscal 2014, Personal Systems experienced
revenue growth in commercial PCs with growth across all product categories, particularly notebooks, along with growth in consumer notebooks. The increase in demand was due in part to customers
migrating from the Windows XP operating system, benefits from the delayed installed base refresh cycle and new product introductions.

•

In Printing, we are experiencing the impact of the growth in mobility and demand challenges in consumer and commercial
markets, as well as an overall competitive pricing environment. To be successful in addressing these challenges, we need to continue to execute on our key initiatives of focusing on products targeted
at high usage categories, developing emerging market opportunities and introducing new revenue delivery models to consumer customers. In fiscal 2014, Printing experienced a revenue decline and an
increase in operating profit as we continued our print strategies, with a focus on driving high value printer unit placements. In the consumer market, our Ink in the Office products are driving unit
volume due to demand for our OfficeJet Pro product lines, particularly our OfficeJet Pro X printers which leverage our Page-Wide Array technology. The Ink in the Office initiative targets
shifting ink into SMBs more profitably. In the commercial market, our focus is on placing higher value printer units which also offer a positive annuity of toner. We are accomplishing this in two
growth areas, in multi-function printers with recently introduced products that are increasing demand and in managed print services, which presents a strong after-market supplies opportunity. We plan
to continue this focus on replenishing the installed base with value-added units, and expanding our innovative ink and laser programs.

•

In EG, we are experiencing revenue challenges due to multiple market trends, including the increasing demand for
hyperscale computing infrastructure products, the transition to cloud computing and a highly competitive pricing environment. In addition, demand for our Business Critical Systems ("BCS") products
continues to weaken along with the overall market for UNIX products and the effect of lower BCS revenue is impacting Technology Services ("TS"). To be successful in overcoming these challenges, we
must address business model shifts and go-to-market execution challenges, and continue to pursue new product innovation in areas such as cloud and data center computing, software-defined networking,
storage, blade servers and wireless networking. In fiscal 2014, EG experienced a decline in revenue and operating profit due to the previously mentioned challenging market environment, in particular
weak market demand in BCS and market shifts impacting Storage. Elsewhere in EG, we experienced areas of

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

growth
in Industry Standard Servers ("ISS"), Networking and TS, due in part to product innovation and new product introductions in cloud and data center computing. These products build on our existing
capabilities in cloud, security, big data and converged infrastructure and include CloudSystem 8, HP Helion, HP Apollo and support solutions such as Proactive data center and flexible capacity
services.

•

In ES, we are facing execution challenges, including managing the revenue runoff from several large contracts, pressured
public sector spending, a competitive pricing environment and market pressures from a mixed economic recovery in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"). To be successful in addressing these
challenges, we must execute on the ES multi-year turnaround plan, which includes a cost reduction initiative to align our costs to our revenue trajectory, a focus on new logo wins and Strategic
Enterprise Services ("SES") and initiatives to improve execution in sales performance and accountability, contracting practices and pricing. In fiscal 2014 these factors continued to impact both ES
revenue and operating profit.

•

In Software, we are facing challenges, including the market shift to software-as-a-service ("SaaS") and go-to-market
execution challenges. To be successful in addressing these challenges, we must improve our go-to-market execution with multiple product delivery models which better address customer needs and achieve
broader integration across our overall product portfolio as we work to capitalize on important market opportunities in cloud, big data and security. In fiscal 2014 these factors continued to impact
Software revenue and operating profit.

To
address these challenges, we continue to pursue innovation with a view towards developing new products and services aligned with market demand, industry trends and the needs of our
customers and partners. In addition, we need to continue to improve our operations, with a particular focus on enhancing our end-to-end processes and efficiencies. We also need to continue to optimize
our sales coverage models, align our sales incentives with our strategic goals, improve channel execution, strengthen our capabilities in our areas of strategic focus, and develop and capitalize on
market opportunities.

For
a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results, see the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

General

The Consolidated Financial Statements of HP are prepared in accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP"), which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of
contingent liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form
the basis for making judgments about the carrying amount of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure
of these estimates with the Audit Committee of HP's Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting amounts are reasonable; however, actual results may
differ from these estimates. Making estimates and judgments about future events is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should
any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

A
summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. An
accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different
estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the following critical
accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price
or fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured, as well as other revenue recognition principles, including industry specific revenue recognition guidance.

We
enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and while many of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are agreements we enter into which contain
non-standard terms and conditions. Further, many of our arrangements include multiple elements. As a result, significant contract interpretation may be required to determine the appropriate
accounting, including the identification of deliverables considered to be separate units of accounting, the allocation of the transaction price among elements in the arrangement and the timing of
revenue recognition for each of those elements.

We
recognize revenue for delivered elements as separate units of accounting when the delivered elements have standalone value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, we
recognize revenue consistent with the pattern of the associated deliverables. If the arrangement includes a customer-negotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered
items and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially within our control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In
arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change
the total revenue recognized for the contract.

We
establish the selling prices used for each deliverable based on vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price, if available, third-party evidence ("TPE"), if VSOE of
selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP"), if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. We establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable
when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and
interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. ESP is established based on management's judgment considering internal factors such as margin
objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and
industry technology life cycles. We may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting both VSOE of selling price and ESP. In most
arrangements with multiple elements, the transaction price is allocated to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on their relative selling price. However, the
aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of the transaction price to deliverables in multiple element arrangements entered into in future periods. This may change the pattern and
timing of revenue recognition for identical



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

arrangements
executed in future periods, but will not change the total revenue recognized for any given arrangement.

We
reduce revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns. Future market
conditions
and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered. For
certain incentive programs, we estimate the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the incentive.

For
hardware products, we recognize revenue generated from direct sales to end customers and indirect sales to channel partners (including resellers, distributors and value-added
solution providers) when the revenue recognition criteria are satisfied. For indirect sales to channel partners, we recognize revenue at the time of delivery when the channel partner has economic
substance apart from HP and HP has completed its obligations related to the sale.

For
the various software products we sell (e.g., operating system software, network enabling software, IT and management software and enterprise security software), we assess
whether the software products were sold standalone or with hardware products. If the software sold with a hardware product is not essential to the functionality of the hardware and is
more-than-incidental, we treat it as a software deliverable.

We
recognize revenue from the sale of perpetual software licenses at inception of the license term, assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Term-based software
license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license. We use the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception of the arrangement when VSOE of fair
value for all undelivered elements, such as post-contract support, exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates
provided on an if-and-when-available basis is recognized ratably over the period during which such items are delivered.

For
hosting or SaaS arrangements, we recognize revenue as the service is delivered, generally on a straight-line basis, over the contractual period of performance. In hosting
arrangements where software licenses are sold, license revenue is generally recognized according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold, when all other revenue recognition criteria are
satisfied. In hosting arrangements that include software licenses, we consider the rights provided to the customer (e.g., ownership of a license, contract termination provisions and feasibility
of the customer to operate the software) in determining when to recognize revenue for the licenses.

We
recognize revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software post-contract customer support agreements, ratably over the
contract period. For certain fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements, we recognize revenue as work progresses using a proportional performance method. We estimate the total expected
labor costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date. We apply a proportional performance method because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various
stages of a contract can be made. On fixed-price contracts for design and build projects (to design, develop and construct software infrastructure and systems), we recognize revenue as work progresses
using the percentage-of-completion method. We use the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date compared to the total estimated
costs of the project. Total project costs are subject to revision throughout the life of a fixed-price contract. Provisions for estimated losses on fixed-price contracts are recognized in the period
when such



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

losses
become known and are recorded as a component of cost of sales. In circumstances when reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made we recognize revenue using the completed
contract method.

Outsourcing
services revenue is generally recognized in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event. We
recognize revenue using an objective measure of output for per unit-priced contracts. Revenue for fixed-price outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straight-line basis if the
service is provided evenly over the contract term. Provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable and are
recorded as a component of cost of sales.

Warranty

We accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a product
group basis. Our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. While we engage in
extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation on contractual warranty
terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failure outside of our baseline
experience. Warranty terms generally range from 90 days to three years for parts and labor, depending upon the product. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty expense and actual
warranty costs have averaged approximately 2.7% and 2.9% of annual net product revenue, respectively.

Restructuring

We have engaged in restructuring actions which require management to estimate the timing and amount of severance and other employee
separation costs for workforce
reduction and enhanced early retirement programs, fair value of assets made redundant or obsolete, and the fair value of lease cancellation and other exit costs. We accrue for severance and other
employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determining severance accruals are based on
existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements. For a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions of restructuring in "Results of Operations" below and
in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefits

Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions. Our major assumptions relate
primarily to discount rates, mortality rates, expected increases in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets. The discount rate assumption is based on current investment
yields of high-quality fixed-income securities with maturities similar to the expected benefits payment period. Mortality rates help predict the expected life of plan participants and are based on a
historical demographic study of the plan. As a result of a historical study of the U.S. plans, in fiscal 2014, HP adopted a new mortality rate table which incorporated newly released mortality rates
published by the Society of Actuaries. This resulted in an increase to the projected benefit obligation of approximately $870 million for the U.S. defined benefit plans. The



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

expected
increase in the compensation levels assumption reflects our long-term actual experience and future expectations. The expected long-term return on plan assets is determined based on asset
allocations, historical portfolio results, historical asset correlations and management's expected returns for each asset class. In any fiscal year, significant differences may arise between the
actual return and the expected long-term return on plan assets. Historically, differences between the actual return and expected long-term return on plan assets have resulted from changes in target or
actual asset allocation, short-term performance relative to expected long-term performance, and to a lesser extent, differences between target and actual investment allocations, the timing of benefit
payments compared to expectations, and the use of derivatives intended to effect asset allocation changes or hedge certain investment or liability exposures. For the recognition of net periodic
benefit cost, the calculation of the expected long-term return on plan assets uses the fair value of plan assets as of the beginning of the fiscal year.

Our
major assumptions vary by plan, and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated
herein by reference. The following table provides the impact changes in the weighted-average assumptions of discount rates, the expected
increase in compensation levels and the expected long-term return on plan assets would have had on our net periodic benefit cost for fiscal 2014:

Taxes on Earnings

We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the final positions
reflected in our income tax returns. We adjust our current and deferred tax provisions based on income tax returns which are generally filed in the third or fourth quarters of the subsequent fiscal
year.

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse.

We
record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we consider
future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to
determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a
corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the
deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate
sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Our
effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided U.S. federal taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings
indefinitely outside the U.S. We plan distributions of foreign earnings based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long-term investment requirements of our foreign
subsidiaries and our domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we expect to indefinitely invest outside the U.S. and the amounts we expect to distribute to the U.S. and
provide the U.S. federal taxes due on amounts expected to be distributed to the U.S. Further, as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from
manufacturing activities in certain jurisdictions is subject to reduced tax rates and, in some cases, is wholly exempt from taxes for fiscal years through 2024. Material changes in our estimates of
cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact how future earnings are repatriated to the U.S., and our related future
effective tax rate.

We
are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and approximately 105 other countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe
that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities.
Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and
recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in
our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows. Our accrual for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to
uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, intercompany transactions and related interest. For a
further discussion on taxes on earnings, refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Inventory

We state our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first-in, first-out basis. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of
inventory to its net realizable value at the product group level for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, technological
changes, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues.

Goodwill

We review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may
not be recoverable. While we are permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, for our annual goodwill
impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we performed a quantitative test for all of our reporting units.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we changed our reporting units. In connection with continued
operational synergies and interdependencies between the Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking reporting unit and the TS reporting unit within the EG segment, we combined these reporting units to
create the EG reporting unit. As of October 31, 2014, our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

in
Note 2, except for ES, which includes two reporting units: MphasiS Limited; and the remainder of ES.

In
the first step of the goodwill impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a
weighting of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach and, to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit
based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry
and market conditions. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk
associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value
based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. We weight the fair
value derived from the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, we
estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using only the income approach. For the MphasiS Limited reporting unit, we utilized the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value.

In
order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of our reporting units, we compare the aggregate reporting unit fair value to HP's market capitalization and calculate
an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units' fair value over HP's market capitalization). We evaluate the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums
from recent comparable transactions. If the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in light of these recent transactions, we reevaluate reporting unit fair values, which may result
in an adjustment to the discount rate and/or other assumptions. This reevaluation could result in a change to the estimated fair value for certain or all of our reporting units.

Estimating
the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue
growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions and the determination of appropriate comparable
publicly-traded companies. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to individual reporting units to determine the carrying amount of each
reporting unit.

If
the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second step,
the reporting unit's assets, including any unrecognized intangible assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests are measured at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied fair
value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less
than its carrying amount, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.

Our
annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed as of the first day of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, did not result in any impairment charges. The excess of fair value
over carrying amount for our reporting units ranged from 18% to approximately 12,000% of carrying amounts. The Software reporting unit has the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount at 18%.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the estimated fair value of our reporting units in the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to
the fair value of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease resulted in an excess of fair value over carrying amount for our reporting units ranging from 6% to approximately 10,000% of the
carrying amounts with the Software reporting unit having the lowest excess of fair value over carrying amount of 6%. The fair value of the Software reporting unit is estimated using a weighting of
both the income and market approaches. Our Software business is facing multiple challenges including the market shift to SaaS and go-to-market execution challenges. If we are not successful in
addressing these challenges, our projected revenue growth rates could decline resulting in a decrease in the fair value of the Software reporting unit. The fair value of the Software reporting unit
could also be negatively impacted by declines in market multiples of revenue for comparable publicly-traded companies, changes in management's business strategy or significant declines in our stock
price, which could result in an indicator of impairment.

Intangible Assets

We review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount
of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of our finite-lived intangible assets is assessed based on the estimated undiscounted
future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the finite-lived intangible assets are
considered to be impaired. The amount of the impairment loss, if any, is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value. We estimate the fair value of
finite-lived intangible assets by using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market approach.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments

We use derivative instruments to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates. We use forwards, swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. At October 31,
2014, the gross notional of our derivative portfolio was $54.7 billion. Assets and liabilities related to derivative instruments are measured at fair value, and were $980 million and
$405 million, respectively as of October 31, 2014.

Fair
value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In the absence of
active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is
consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about
assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those
differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to the asset or liability being valued. We generally use industry
standard valuation models to measure the fair value of our derivative positions. When prices in active markets are not available for the identical asset or liability, we use industry standard
valuation models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based observable inputs, including
interest rate curves, HP and counterparty credit risk, foreign currency exchange rates, and forward and spot prices.

For
a further discussion on fair value measurements and derivative instruments, refer to Note 10 and Note 11, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Loss Contingencies

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings including those consisting of IP, commercial, securities,
employment, employee benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred
and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both the probability of having incurred a liability and the estimated amount of the liability. We
review these matters at least quarterly and adjust these liabilities to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel and other updated information and events,
pertaining to a particular case. Based on our experience, we believe that any damage amounts claimed in the specific litigation and contingencies matters further discussed in Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, are not a meaningful indicator of HP's potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable.
However, we believe we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by
the resolution of one or more of these contingencies. We believe we have recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2014, it was not reasonably possible that a
material loss had been incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in our financial statements.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our consolidated financial statements see Note 1 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Revenue from our international operations has historically represented, and we expect will continue to represent, a majority of our
overall net revenue. As a result, our revenue growth has been impacted, and we expect will continue to be impacted, by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In order to provide a framework
for assessing performance excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, we present the year-over-year percentage change in revenue on a constant currency basis, which assumes no change in
foreign currency exchange rates from the prior-year period. This information is provided so that revenue can be viewed without the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, which is
consistent with how management evaluates our revenue results and trends. This constant currency disclosure is provided in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the year-over-year percentage change
in revenue on a GAAP basis. Other companies
may calculate and define similarly labeled items differently, which may limit the usefulness of this measure for comparative purposes.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

In fiscal 2014, total HP net revenue declined 0.8% (decreased 0.4% on a constant currency basis) as compared with fiscal 2013. U.S. net
revenue decreased 3.7% to $38.8 billion, while net revenue from outside of the U.S. increased 0.9% to $72.6 billion. The leading contributors to the HP net revenue decline were key
account runoff in ES and lower Printing supplies volume. Partially offsetting the net revenue decline was growth in Personal Systems from commercial PCs, which experienced growth across all product
categories, along with growth in consumer notebooks.

From
a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in HP net revenue for fiscal 2014 compared with fiscal 2013 are summarized as
follows:

•

ES net revenue declined due primarily to revenue runoff in key accounts, weak growth in new and existing accounts,
particularly in EMEA, and contractual price declines;

•

Printing net revenue decreased due primarily to a decline in Supplies;

•

EG net revenue decreased due to net revenue declines in TS, BCS and Storage;

•

Software net revenue decreased due to lower net revenue from licenses, support and professional services;

•

HPFS net revenue decreased due primarily to lower portfolio revenue from lower average portfolio assets and lower asset
management activity, primarily in customer buyouts;

•

Corporate Investments net revenue increased due to the sale of intellectual property ("IP"); and

•

Personal Systems net revenue increased due to growth in commercial PCs, particularly notebooks, along with growth in
consumer notebooks.

Fiscal 2013 compared with Fiscal 2012

In fiscal 2013, total HP net revenue declined 6.7% (decreased 5.5% on a constant currency basis) as compared with fiscal 2012. U.S. net
revenue decreased 4.4% to $40.3 billion, while net revenue from outside of the U.S. decreased 7.9% to $72.0 billion. The net revenue decline was due primarily to declines of
approximately 10%, 7%, 5% and 3% in our Personal Systems, ES, EG and Printing segments, respectively.

From
a segment perspective, the primary factors contributing to the change in HP net revenue for fiscal 2013 compared with fiscal 2012 are summarized as
follows:

•

Personal Systems net revenue declined due to the decline in the overall PC market as a result of a customer shift,
particularly consumers, to tablet products;

•

ES net revenue declined due primarily to net service revenue runoff and contractual price declines in ongoing contracts
due in part to weak public sector spending and enterprise IT demand;

•

EG net revenue declined due to multiple factors, including competitive pricing challenges in ISS, a market decline for
UNIX products impacting BCS, declines in TS due in part to lower support for BCS products, product transitions in Storage and overall weak enterprise IT demand;

•

Printing net revenue declined due to unfavorable currency impacts, particularly the euro, and declines in supplies and
commercial printers;



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

•

HPFS net revenue decreased due primarily to lower rental revenue from a decrease in operating lease assets; and

•

Software net revenue declined due to lower license and professional services revenues from IT/cloud management and
information management products.

A
more detailed discussion of segment revenue is included under "Segment Information" below.

Gross Margin

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

HP's gross margin increased by 0.8 percentage points for fiscal year 2014 compared with fiscal 2013. From a segment perspective,
the primary factors impacting gross margin performance are summarized as follows:

•

ES gross margin increased due primarily to our continued focus on service delivery efficiencies, improving profit
performance in under-performing contracts and labor savings as a result of restructuring;

•

Printing gross margin increased due primarily to favorable currency impacts from the Japanese Yen, continued cost
structure improvements and a favorable mix from a higher proportion of graphics and ink supplies;

•

Corporate Investments gross margin increased due to the sale of IP;

•

Software gross margin increased due to the shift to more profitable contracts and improved workforce utilization in
professional services;

•

HPFS gross margin increased due to a higher portfolio margin, primarily from lower bad debt expense, a lower cost of
funds and improved margins in remarketing sales;

•

Personal Systems gross margin increased due primarily to operational cost improvements, a favorable mix of commercial
products and the sale of IP; and

•

EG gross margin decreased due primarily to the impact of a higher mix of ISS products, lower mix of BCS products and
competitive pricing pressure in ISS and Networking.

Fiscal 2013 compared with Fiscal 2012

HP's gross margin decreased by 0.2 percentage points for fiscal year 2013 compared with fiscal 2012. From a segment perspective,
the primary factors impacting gross margin performance are summarized as follows:

•

EG experienced a gross margin decline due primarily to competitive pricing pressures in ISS, and to a lesser extent, mix
impacts from lower BCS and Storage revenue;

•

Personal Systems experienced a gross margin decline due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and competitive pricing
pressures;

•

ES gross margin decreased due to net service revenue runoff and contractual price declines;

•

Software gross margin decreased slightly due to higher development costs in IT/cloud management products;



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

•

HPFS gross margin increased slightly due primarily to higher portfolio margins from a lower mix of operating leases and
higher margins on early buyouts; and

•

Printing gross margin increased due primarily to improvement in toner gross margins as a result of lower discounting and
higher average revenue per unit ("ARU") in consumer printers.

A
more detailed discussion of segment gross margins and operating margins is included under "Segment Information" below.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

R&D
expense increased 10% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 with increases across each of our segments as we make investments in our strategic focus
areas of cloud, security, big data and mobility.

R&D
expense decreased 8% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to the rationalization of R&D in EG for BCS, cost savings from restructuring and higher value added R&D
tax subsidy credits. The decrease was partially offset by increased R&D expense in our Storage and ISS business units and in Software for innovation-focused spending in the areas of converged
infrastructure and cloud.

Selling, General and Administrative

SG&A
expense increased 1% in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 due primarily to higher compensation costs, litigation expenses and higher selling costs
from investments in the areas of cloud, networking and storage, partially offset by gains from sales of real estate and lower program spending in marketing.

SG&A
expense decreased 2% in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts that impacted all of our segments.
Partially offsetting the decline were higher marketing expenses to support new product introductions and increased administrative expenses due in part to higher consulting project spending.

Amortization of Intangible Assets

Amortization
expense decreased in fiscal 2014 due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their
respective amortization periods.

Amortization
expense decreased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the intangible asset impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 related to Autonomy and certain intangible
assets associated with prior acquisitions reaching the end of their amortization periods.

Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets

In
fiscal 2012, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $8.0 billion and $5.7 billion associated with ES and the acquisition of Autonomy,
respectively. In addition, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $3.1 billion and $1.2 billion associated with the acquisition of Autonomy and the "Compaq" trade name,
respectively. For more information on our impairment charges, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring
charges increased in fiscal 2014 due primarily to higher charges in connection with the multi-year restructuring plan initially announced in May
2012 (the "2012 Plan") and from increases to the 2012 Plan announced in fiscal 2014. During fiscal 2014, HP increased the total for positions expected to be eliminated under the 2012 Plan from 34,000
to 55,000 positions. With these changes, HP expects to recognize additional restructuring charges in fiscal 2015.

Restructuring
charges decreased in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the $2.1 billion charge recorded in fiscal 2012 for the 2012 Plan. Restructuring charges for fiscal 2013 were
approximately $1.0 billion, which included $1.2 billion of charges related to the 2012 Plan that were partially offset by a reversal of $190 million of severance charges related
to our fiscal 2010 ES restructuring plan.

Interest and Other, Net

Interest and other, net expense increased by $7 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was due primarily to higher currency
transaction losses partially offset by lower interest expense from a lower average debt balance.

Interest
and other, net expense decreased by $255 million in fiscal 2013. The decrease was driven primarily by lower currency transaction losses coupled with lower interest
expense due to lower average debt balances and lower investment losses.

Provision for Taxes

Our effective tax rates were 23.5%, 21.5%, and (6.0)% in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our effective tax rate generally
differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates associated with certain earnings from our operations in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world. The jurisdictions
with favorable tax rates that had the most significant effective tax rate impact in the periods presented were Puerto Rico, Singapore, Netherlands, China and Ireland. We plan to reinvest certain
earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the U.S. and therefore have not provided U.S. taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings.

In
addition to the above factors, the effective tax rate in fiscal 2012 was impacted by nondeductible goodwill impairments and increases in valuation allowances against certain deferred
tax assets.

For
a reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our provision for taxes, see Note 6 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Segment Information

A description of the products and services for each segment can be found in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the segments disclosed.

Effective
at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we implemented certain organizational changes to align the segment financial reporting more closely with our current
business structure. These organizational changes include:

•

transferring the HP Exstream business from the Commercial Hardware business unit within the Printing segment to the
Software segment;



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

•

transferring the Personal Systems trade and warranty support business from the TS business unit within the EG segment to
the Other business unit within the Personal Systems segment;

•

transferring the spare and replacement parts supporting the Personal Systems and Printing segments from the TS business
unit within the EG segment to the Other business unit within the Personal Systems segment and the Commercial Hardware business unit within the Printing segment, respectively; and

•

transferring certain cloud-related incubation activities previously reported in Corporate and unallocated costs and
eliminations and in the EG segment to the Corporate Investments segment.

In
addition, we transferred certain intrasegment eliminations from the ES segment and the EG segment to corporate intersegment revenue eliminations.

HP
has reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which has resulted in the transfer of revenue among the Printing, Personal
Systems, EG, ES and Software segments and the transfer of operating profit among the Printing, Personal Systems, EG, Software and Corporate Investments segments. These changes had no impact on the
previously reported financial results for the HPFS segment. In addition, none of these changes impacted HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings, net
EPS or consolidated assets.

Printing and Personal Systems Group

The Personal Systems segment and the Printing segment are structured beneath a broader Printing and Personal Systems Group ("PPS"). We
describe the results of the business segments within PPS below.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

Personal Systems net revenue increased 6.6% (increased 7.2% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. While the Personal Systems
business continues to be challenged by the market shift towards mobility products, the pace of the PC market decline is slowing with signs of stabilization driven by growth in commercial PCs, the
effects of which were partially offset by weakness in consumer PCs. The revenue increase in Personal Systems was due to growth in commercial PCs, particularly notebooks, along with growth in consumer
notebooks. Personal Systems experienced revenue growth across all regions led by double digit revenue growth in EMEA, which experienced improved demand. The revenue increase was driven by an 8.2%
increase in unit volume, the effects of which were partially offset by a 1.5% decline in average selling prices ("ASPs"). The unit volume increase was primarily led by growth in commercial notebooks
as well as strength in commercial desktops, consumer notebooks and thin client products. The decline in ASPs was due primarily to a competitive pricing environment and unfavorable currency impacts,
the effects of which were partially offset by a favorable mix of commercial PCs. Net revenue for commercial clients increased 10.2% due primarily to the benefits from the delayed installed base
refresh cycle, the effects of customers migrating from the Windows XP operating system and growth in all product categories partly driven by new product introductions, including the HP Elite products.
Net revenue for consumer clients remained flat as growth in consumer notebooks, partly driven by our new product lineup including Chromebooks and hybrid products, was offset by a decline in consumer
desktops. For fiscal 2014, net revenue for Notebook PCs increased 9%, Desktop PCs increased 3%, Workstations increased 3% and Other net
revenue increased 16%. The net revenue increase in Other was due to the sale of IP and growth in mobility products, primarily consumer tablets which were introduced in the second half of fiscal 2013.

Personal
Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 0.7 percentage points for fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by an increase in gross margin
and a decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin was due primarily to operational cost improvements, a favorable commercial mix and the sale of IP, the
effects of which were partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased due primarily to our cost structure optimization efforts, the
effects of which were partially offset by increased research and development investments for commercial, mobility and immersive computing products, as well as higher administrative expenses driven by
lower bad debt recoveries as compared to fiscal 2013.

Fiscal 2013 compared with Fiscal 2012

Personal Systems net revenue decreased 10.2% (decreased 9.0% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2013. The Personal Systems
business continued to experience significant challenges due to the overall PC market decline as a result of a customer shift, particularly consumers, to tablet products. The business also experienced
broad-based regional demand weakness, particularly in the EMEA region. The decline in Personal Systems revenue was driven by an 8% decline in unit volume along with a 3% decline in ASPs. The unit
volume decrease was led by declines in consumer and notebook products as a result of the market shift to tablet products. The decline in ASPs was due primarily to a competitive pricing environment.
Net revenue for consumer clients decreased 19%, while net revenue for commercial clients decreased 4%. Notebook PCs net revenue decreased 15%, while Desktop PCs net revenue decreased 8%. Workstations
net revenue growth was flat, while Other net revenue increased 19%. The net revenue increase in Other was related to increased sales of extended warranties and third-party branded options and sales of
consumer tablets.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Personal
Systems earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.8 percentage points in fiscal 2013. The decrease was driven by a decline in gross margin combined
with an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The decline in gross margin was due to unfavorable currency impacts and competitive pricing pressures. These unfavorable impacts
to gross margin were partially offset by lower component and warranty costs and a favorable mix of higher-margin commercial products. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased due
primarily to the size of the revenue decline as well as slightly higher R&D costs. However, operating expenses declined across most other expense categories as a result of benefits from our ongoing
restructuring efforts.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

In fiscal 2014, Printing experienced a decline in revenue and an increase in operating profit as we continued to push our print
strategies, which includes driving high value printer unit placements and expanding our graphics products and managed print services portfolio. Printing net revenue decreased 3.8% (decreased 3.4% on a
constant currency basis) for fiscal 2014. The decline in net revenue was primarily driven by a decline in Supplies, the effects of which were partially offset by growth in graphics products and
managed print services. Net revenue for Supplies decreased 5% driven by demand weakness in toner and ink, and a reduction in channel inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, the effects of
which were partially offset by growth in graphics supplies. Printer unit volume remained flat while average revenue per unit ("ARU") decreased 1%. Printer unit volume was flat due primarily to our
continued efforts to target high value areas of the market, which resulted in a decline in home printer units and low-value LaserJet printer units, the effects of which were offset
by increased units in SMB, multifunction laser and graphics printers. The decline in ARU was due primarily to increased discounting driven by competitive pricing pressures. Net revenue for Commercial
Hardware was flat as a 3% increase in printer unit volume was offset by a 3% decline in printer ARU. The unit volume in Commercial Hardware increased due primarily to growth in our multifunction laser
printers and graphics printers. The ARU decline in Commercial Hardware was due primarily to a decline in



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

LaserJet
and graphics printers driven by a competitive pricing environment. Net revenue for Consumer Hardware decreased 4% driven by a 1% decline in printer unit volume and a 1% decline in ARU, along
with a decline in other peripheral printing solutions. The unit volume decline in Consumer Hardware was due to lower sales of home printers, the effects of which were partially offset by growth in SMB
printers. The ARU decline in Consumer Hardware was due primarily to increased discounting for SMB printers due to a competitive pricing environment, the effects of which were partially offset by a
favorable mix of high value home printers.

Printing
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.7 percentage points for fiscal 2014 as an increase in gross margin more than offset an increase in
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin increase was due to favorable currency impacts primarily driven by the Japanese Yen, continued cost structure improvements and a
favorable mix from a higher proportion of graphics and ink supplies, the effects of which were partially offset by a competitive pricing environment. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue
increased due primarily to higher R&D expenses as a result of our investments in enterprise products and 3-D printing, the effects of which were partially offset by reduced marketing expenses.

Fiscal 2013 compared with Fiscal 2012

Printing net revenue decreased 2.6% (decreased 1% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2013. The decrease was driven by unfavorable
currency impacts, particularly weakness in the euro, and declines in supplies and commercial printers. Net revenue for Supplies decreased 3% due to unfavorable currency impacts and lower volumes of
toner and ink supplies. These effects were partially offset by growth in large format printing supplies. Printer unit volumes declined by 3% while ARU increased by 1%. Printer unit volumes decreased
largely due to declines in low-end consumer printers as we continued our focus on higher-value Ink in the Office and Ink Advantage products. The increase in ARU was driven by a mix shift to high-value
consumer printers, the effect of which was partially offset by higher discounting in commercial printers. Net revenue for Commercial Hardware decreased 3%, which was driven by a 6% decline in ARU that
was partially offset by a volume increase of 2%. The decline in Commercial Hardware net revenue was partially offset by net revenue growth in the graphics services and managed print services
businesses. Net revenue for
Consumer Hardware remained flat due to a 7% increase in ARU, the effect of which was offset by a 5% reduction in volume. Unit volume and ARU increased within high-value consumer printers as a result
of our continued focus on those more profitable printers.

Printing
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.8 percentage points in fiscal 2013 due to an increase in gross margin combined with lower operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin increase was due to improvement in toner gross margins resulting from lower discounting, higher ARU in consumer printers, and lower cost of
sales in toner and commercial printers due to a favorable currency impact from the Japanese Yen. These positive effects were partially offset by an unfavorable mix of lower-margin consumer printers.
Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased due to lower administrative, R&D and field selling costs as a result of benefits from our ongoing restructuring efforts. These effects were
partially offset by higher marketing expenses to support new product introductions.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

EG net revenue decreased 1.0% (decreased 0.6% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. In EG, we continue to experience revenue
challenges due to market trends, including the transition to cloud computing, as well as product and technology transitions, along with a highly competitive pricing environment. The decline in EG net
revenue was due to net revenue declines in TS, BCS and Storage partially offset by net revenue growth in ISS and Networking.

TS
net revenue decreased 4% due primarily to a continued reduction in support for BCS, traditional storage products and lower support in networking services, partially offset by growth
in support solutions for converged storage solutions and ISS. BCS net revenue decreased 22% as a result of ongoing pressures from the overall UNIX market contraction. Storage net revenue decreased by
5% as we continue to experience multiple challenges including product transitions from traditional storage products which include our tape, storage networking and legacy external disk products, to
converged solutions, which include our 3PAR StoreServ, StoreOnce, and StoreVirtual products, other challenges include market weakness in high-end converged solutions and sales execution challenges,
the effects of which were partially offset by revenue growth in our Converged Storage solutions. Networking net revenue increased 4% due to higher switching product revenue as a result of growth in
our data center products, partially offset by lower revenue from wireless local area network products. ISS net revenue increased by 3% due primarily to higher volume and higher average unit prices in
rack and blade server products driven by higher option attach rates for memory, processors and hard drives.

EG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.8 percentage points in fiscal 2014 due to a decrease in gross margin coupled with an increase in
operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin decline was due primarily to a higher mix of ISS products, a lower mix of BCS products and competitive pricing pressure in ISS and
Networking, partially offset

by
supply chain cost optimization and improved cost management in TS. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was driven by higher R&D investments in storage, networking and
ISS, partially offset by continued cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts.

Fiscal 2013 compared with Fiscal 2012

EG net revenue decreased 5.3% (decreased 4.2% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2013 due primarily to the macroeconomic demand
challenges the business faced during the fiscal year. Additionally, new product and technology transitions in Storage and ISS and a competitive pricing environment contributed to the revenue decline.
EG also experienced execution challenges that impacted revenue growth in fiscal 2013, although those challenges moderated in the fourth quarter due to improved sales execution. Each of the business
units within EG experienced year-over-year revenue declines in fiscal 2013 except Networking. ISS net revenue decreased by 4% due to competitive pricing and soft demand. Within ISS, we experienced a
revenue decline in our core mainstream products that was partially offset by revenue growth in our hyperscale server products. TS net revenue decreased by 4% due to revenue declines in the support and
consulting businesses and, to a lesser extent, to unfavorable currency impacts. Support revenue declined due to a reduction in support for BCS products. The consulting revenue decline was a result of
unfavorable currency impacts, the divestiture of a service product line and a shift to more profitable services such as data center and storage consulting. BCS net revenue decreased by 26% as a result
of ongoing pressures from the decline in the overall UNIX market along with lower demand for our Itanium-based servers. Storage net revenue decreased by 9% due to declines in traditional storage
products, which include our tape, storage networking, and legacy external disk products, the effects of which were partially offset by growth in Converged Storage solutions, which include our 3PAR,
StoreOnce, StoreVirtual and StoreAll products. Networking revenue increased by 2% due to higher demand for our switching, routing, and wireless products, the effect of which was partially offset by
the impact of the divestiture of our video surveillance business in the first quarter of fiscal 2012.

EG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 2.1 percentage points in fiscal 2013 driven by a decrease in gross margin and, to a lesser extent, an
increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin decrease was due primarily to competitive pricing pressures in ISS and, to a lesser extent, pricing pressures in Storage
and mix impacts from lower BCS revenue. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased due to the decline in EG net revenue and increased field selling costs and administrative expenses.
R&D expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased due primarily to the rationalization of R&D specifically for BCS and a value-added tax subsidy credit in BCS. EG also benefited from cost savings
resulting from our ongoing restructuring efforts.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

ES net revenue decreased 6.9% (decreased 6.8% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. Performance in ES remains challenged by the
impact of several large contracts winding down and lower public sector spending in EMEA, particularly in the United Kingdom, and several other countries in EMEA. The net revenue decrease in ES was due
primarily to revenue runoff in key accounts, weak growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in EMEA, and contractual price declines. These effects were partially offset by net revenue growth
in our SES portfolio, which includes information management and analytics, security and cloud services. Net revenue in Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing ("ITO") decreased by 8% in fiscal 2014 due
to revenue runoff in key accounts, weak growth in new and existing accounts, particularly in EMEA, and contractual price declines in ongoing contracts partially offset by growth in cloud and security
revenue and favorable currency impacts. Net revenue in Application and Business Services ("ABS") decreased by 5% in fiscal 2014, due to revenue runoff in a key account, weak growth in new and existing
accounts, particularly in EMEA, and unfavorable currency impacts, partially offset by growth in information management and analytics and cloud revenue.

ES
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 0.8 percentage points in fiscal 2014. The increase in operating margin was due to an increase in gross margin,
partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Gross margin increased due primarily to our continued focus on service delivery efficiencies, improving profit
performance in under-performing contracts and labor savings as a result of restructuring, partially offset by unfavorable impacts from revenue runoff in key accounts and weak growth in new and
existing accounts. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily driven by the size of the revenue decline and higher administrative expenses and field selling costs.
The increase in current year administrative expenses was due to the prior-year period containing higher bad debt recoveries and insurance recoveries. The increase in selling costs was the result of
expanding the sales force coverage as we transition from a reactive sales model to a more proactive approach.

Fiscal 2013 compared with Fiscal 2012

ES net revenue decreased 7.4% (decreased 6.3% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2013. Revenue performance in ES continues to be
challenged by several factors that impact the demand environment, including weak public sector spending in the U.S. and austerity measures in other countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, and
weak IT services spend due to the mixed global recovery, particularly in the EMEA region. The net revenue decrease in ES was driven primarily by net service revenue runoff, contractual price declines
in ongoing contracts and unfavorable currency impacts. ITO net revenue decreased by 6% in fiscal 2013, due to net service revenue runoff,

contractual
price declines in ongoing contracts and unfavorable currency impacts, the effects of which were partially offset by net revenue growth in security and cloud offerings. ABS net revenue
declined 10% in fiscal 2013. The net revenue decline was due primarily to net service revenue runoff and unfavorable currency impacts, the effects of which were partially offset by revenue growth in
cloud and information and analytics offerings. Revenue in ABS was also negatively impacted by weakness in public-sector spending.

ES
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased 1.2 percentage points in fiscal 2013. The decrease was due to a decline in gross margin combined with an
increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Gross margin declined due primarily to net service revenue runoff and contractual price declines. These unfavorable impacts to gross
margin were partially offset by our continued focus on improving resource management and profit improvements on under-performing contracts. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased
due to higher administrative, marketing and R&D costs. These effects were partially offset by reduced field selling
costs due to lower headcount-related costs during the year and other savings from our ongoing restructuring efforts.

Software net revenue decreased 2.2% (decreased 2.1% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014. Revenue growth in Software is being
challenged by the overall market and customer shift to SaaS solutions, which is impacting growth in license and support revenue. In fiscal 2014, net revenue from licenses, support and professional
services decreased by 3%, 2% and 5% respectively, while SaaS net revenue increased by 5%.

The
decline in license net revenue was due to the market and customer shift to SaaS solutions, which resulted in lower revenue from IT/cloud management and information management
products, partially offset by strength in some of our key focus areas of big data analytics and security. The decrease in support net revenue was due to past declines in license revenue. Professional
services net revenue decreased as we continue our focus on higher-margin engagements. These declines were partially offset by higher SaaS revenue due to improving demand for our SaaS solutions in
IT/cloud management products and security products.

In
fiscal 2014, Software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.6 percentage points due to an increase in gross margin, the effect of which was
partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin was due to
the shift to more profitable contracts and improved workforce utilization in professional services. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to investments
in R&D partially offset by lower SG&A expenses due to cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts and improved operational expense management.

Fiscal 2013 compared with Fiscal 2012

Software net revenue decreased 3.6% (decreased 2.6% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2013. Net revenue from licenses and
professional services decreased by 16% and 13%, respectively, while net revenue from SaaS and support increased by 10% and 7%, respectively.

The
decline in software revenue was driven primarily by lower license revenue from IT/cloud management and information management products, due primarily to a large deal entered into in
the prior year and the market shift to SaaS offerings. The revenue decline was also due to lower professional services revenue from IT/cloud management and information management products as we manage
the professional services portfolio to focus on higher-margin solutions. These declines were partially offset by higher growth in support revenue from our information management and security products
and higher revenue growth in our SaaS offerings from IT/cloud management and information management products as we shift with the market to providing more SaaS offerings.

Software
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.6 percentage points in fiscal 2013 due to a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net
revenue, the effect of which was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. The decrease in gross margin was due primarily to higher development costs in IT/cloud management products and the
comparative impact of a highly profitable software deal entered into in the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by a lower mix of lower-margin professional services revenue. The decrease
in operating expense as a percentage of revenue was driven primarily by lower field selling costs due to cost savings associated with our ongoing restructuring efforts.

HPFS net revenue decreased by 3.6% (decreased 3.3% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2014 due primarily to lower portfolio
revenue from lower average portfolio assets and lower asset management activity, primarily in customer buyouts.

HPFS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.1 percentage points in fiscal 2014. The increase was due primarily to an increase in gross margin,
partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin was the result of a higher portfolio margin, primarily from lower bad debt expense
and a lower cost of funds and improved margins in remarketing sales. The increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due primarily to higher go-to-market investments.

Fiscal 2013 compared with Fiscal 2012

HPFS net revenue decreased by 5.0% (decreased 4.2% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2013 due primarily to lower rental revenue
from a decrease in average operating lease assets, lower asset recovery services revenue, and unfavorable currency impacts. These effects were partially offset by higher revenue from remarketing sales
and higher finance income from an increase in finance lease assets.

HPFS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.8 percentage points in fiscal 2013. The increase was due primarily to an
increase in gross margin, the effect of which was partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue as a result of higher IT investments. The increase in gross
margin was the result of higher portfolio margin from a lower mix of operating leases, higher margin on early buyouts and lower bad debt expense.

the decrease in fiscal 2013 was primarily driven by lower financing associated with HP product sales and services offerings, and to a lesser extent unfavorable currency impacts.

Portfolio Assets and Ratios

The HPFS business model is asset intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial
services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive HPFS amounts are substantially the same as
those used by HP. However, intercompany loans and certain accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

October 31, 2013, respectively. HPFS equity at both October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013 was $1.5 billion. We believe the HPFS debt-to-equity ratio is comparable to that
of other similar financing companies.

Fiscal 2014 compared with Fiscal 2013

The revenue increase for fiscal 2014 was due primarily to the sale of IP related to the Palm acquisition.

The
decrease in the loss from operations for fiscal 2014 was due primarily to the sale of IP, the benefits of which were partially offset by higher expenses associated with cloud-related
incubation activities, corporate strategy, HP Labs and global alliances.

Fiscal 2013 compared with Fiscal 2012

In fiscal 2013, Corporate Investments net revenue was primarily related to licensing revenue from HP Labs. Net revenue decreased from
fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower residual activity from the webOS device business and lower revenue from business intelligence products.

Costs
and expenses in Corporate Investments are due to activities in the segment from residual activity related to the webOS device business, HP Labs, certain incubation projects,
corporate strategy, and global alliances.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity. We believe that internally generated cash flows are generally
sufficient to support our operating businesses, capital expenditures, restructuring activities, maturing debt, income tax payments and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to investments
and share repurchases. We are able to supplement this short-term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit facilities made available by various domestic and foreign
financial institutions. Our access to capital markets may be constrained and our cost of borrowing may increase under certain business, market and economic conditions; however, our access to a variety
of funding sources to meet our liquidity needs is designed to facilitate continued access to capital resources under all such conditions. Our liquidity is subject to various risks including the risks
identified in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A and market risks identified in the section entitled "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in Item 7A,
which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our
cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, with substantially all of those amounts held outside of the U.S. We utilize a variety of planning and financing
strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available when and where it is needed. Our cash position remains strong, and we expect that our cash balances, anticipated cash flow
generated from operations and access to capital markets will be sufficient to cover our expected near-term cash outlays.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Amounts
held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support non-U.S. liquidity needs, although a portion of those amounts may from time to time be subject to short-term
intercompany loans into the U.S. Most of the amounts held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. but, under current law, some would be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, less
applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign earnings is restricted by local law. Except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., we have
provided for the U.S. federal tax liability on these earnings for financial statement purposes. Repatriation could result in additional income tax payments in future years. Where local restrictions
prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the U.S. and we would meet liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external
borrowings, or both. We do not expect restrictions or potential taxes incurred on repatriation of amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity, financial
condition or results of operations.

Days
of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable,
net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average of net revenue. For fiscal 2014, the decrease in DSO was due primarily to the impact of currency and the expansion of our factoring
programs.

Days
of supply in inventory ("DOS") measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day average of
cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2014, the increase in DOS was due to a higher inventory balance in Personal Systems due in part to strategic and advanced buys.

Days
of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("DPO") measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts
payable by a 90-day average of cost of goods sold. For fiscal 2014, the increase in DPO was primarily the result of an extension of payment terms with our product suppliers.

The
cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO. The cash conversion cycle ended fiscal 2014 below what we expect to be a long-term sustainable rate. Items which may cause
the cash conversion cycle in a particular period to differ from a long-term sustainable rate include, but are not limited to, changes in business mix, changes in payment terms, extent of receivables
factoring, seasonal trends and the timing of revenue recognition and inventory purchases within the period.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was flat for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013, due primarily to higher cash utilization for
purchases of property, plant and equipment offset by cash generated from sales of available-for-sale securities. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $0.7 billion for fiscal 2013
as compared to fiscal 2012, due primarily to lower investments in property, plant and equipment and higher net sales and maturities of available-for-sale securities.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by approximately $1.4 billion for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The
decrease was due primarily to proceeds from the issuance of U.S. Dollar Global Notes in January 2014, partially offset by higher debt repayments and repurchases of common stock. Net cash used in
financing activities increased by $4.1 billion for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. The increase was due primarily to higher maturities of debt and net repayments of commercial paper.

Short-term
debt and long-term debt decreased by $2.5 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively, for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. The net decrease in total debt was
due primarily to maturities of debt. During fiscal 2014, we issued $2.0 billion of U.S. Dollar Global Notes under the 2012 Shelf Registration Statement which mature in 2019 and repaid
$4.9 billion of U.S. Dollar Global Notes. We also issued $11.6 billion and repaid $11.5 billion of commercial paper in fiscal 2014. Short-term debt and long-term debt decreased by
$0.6 billion and $5.2 billion, respectively, for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. Both net decreases were due primarily to maturities of debt and net repayments of commercial
paper. The issuances and repayments of commercial paper were $16.1 billion and $16.2 billion in fiscal 2013 and $12.2 billion and $15.0 billion in fiscal 2012,
respectively.

During
fiscal 2015, $2.5 billion of U.S. Dollar Global Notes are scheduled to mature, of which $650 million matured in December 2014. For more information on our
borrowings, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our
debt-to-equity ratio is calculated as the carrying amount of debt divided by total stockholders' equity. Our debt-to-equity ratio decreased by 0.10x in fiscal 2014, due to a decrease
in total debt balances of $3.1 billion partially offset by a decrease in stockholders' equity by $0.5 billion at the end of fiscal 2014. Our debt-to-equity ratio decreased by 0.43x in
fiscal 2013, due to a decrease in total debt balances of $5.8 billion coupled with an increase in stockholders' equity by $4.8 billion at the end of fiscal 2013.

For
more information on our borrowings, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our
weighted-average interest rate reflects the effective interest rate on our borrowings prevailing during the period and reflects the effect of interest rate swaps. For more
information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Credit Ratings

Our credit risk is evaluated by major independent rating agencies based on publicly available information as well as information
obtained in our ongoing discussions with them. Our credit ratings as of October 31, 2014, were as follows:

Standard & Poor's

Ratings Services

Moody's Investors

Service

Fitch Ratings

Services

Short-term debt ratings

A-2

Prime-2

F2

Long-term debt ratings

BBB+

Baa1

A-

After
the announcement of our separation in October 2014, our credit ratings were assigned a negative outlook by Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Fitch Rating Services.
Additionally, Moody's Investors Service placed us under review for downgrade. In December 2013, Moody's Investors Service affirmed its negative outlook assigned in November 2012. While we do not have
any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt, previous downgrades have increased the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities, have reduced
market capacity for our commercial paper and have required the posting of additional collateral under some of our derivative contracts. In addition, any further downgrade to our credit ratings by any
of these rating agencies may further impact us in a similar manner, and, depending on the extent of the downgrade, could have a negative impact on our liquidity and capital position. We can rely on
alternative sources of funding, including drawdowns under our credit facilities or the issuance of debt or other securities under our existing 2012 Shelf Registration Statement, if necessary, to
offset potential reductions in the market capacity for our commercial paper.

(1)

Amounts
represent the principal cash payments relating to our long-term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments, discounts or
premiums.

(2)

Amounts
represent the expected interest payments relating to our long-term debt. We have outstanding interest rate swap agreements accounted
for as fair value hedges that have the economic effect of changing fixed interest rates associated with some of our U.S. Dollar Global Notes to variable interest rates. The impact of our outstanding
interest rate swaps at October 31, 2014 was factored into the calculation of the future interest payments on long-term debt.

(3)

Purchase
obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all
significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. These purchase obligations are
related principally to inventory and other items. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. Purchase obligations also exclude open purchase orders that are routine
arrangements entered into in the ordinary course of business as they are difficult to quantify in a meaningful way. Even though open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, the
terms generally allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust terms based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services.

(4)

In
fiscal 2015, HP anticipates making contributions of $686 million to its non-U.S. pension plans, expects to pay benefits of
$35 million to its U.S. non-qualified pension plan participants and expects to pay claims of $47 million under its post-retirement benefit plans. Our policy is to fund our pension plans
so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding and taxing authorities. Expected contributions and payments to our pension and
post-retirement benefit plans are excluded from the contractual obligations table because they do not represent contractual cash outflows as they are dependent on numerous factors which may result in
a wide range of outcomes. For more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

(5)

We
expect future cash payments of $1.8 billion in connection with our approved restructuring plans which includes $1.0 billion
expected to be paid in fiscal 2015 with the remaining approximately $800 million cash payments to be made through fiscal 2021. Payments for restructuring have been



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

excluded
from the contractual obligations table, because they do not represent contractual cash outflows and there is uncertainty as to the timing of these payments. For more information on our
restructuring activities, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

(6)

As
of October 31, 2014, we had approximately $3.5 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining
to uncertain tax positions. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include $27 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a
reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters. Payments of these obligations would result from settlements
with taxing authorities. For more information on our uncertain tax positions, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or
other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

We
have third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. The total aggregate maximum capacity of the
financing arrangements was $3.0 billion as of October 31, 2014, including an aggregate maximum capacity of
$1.1 billion in non-recourse financing arrangements and an aggregate maximum capacity of $1.9 billion in partial-recourse facilities. For more information on our third-party revolving
short-term financing arrangements, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.



ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our
financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only
to manage existing underlying exposures. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects
of changes in fair value for each of these exposures is outlined below.

Actual
gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate
movements and our actual exposures and derivatives in place at the time of the change, as well as the effectiveness of the derivative to hedge the related exposure.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and
assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 75 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant foreign currencies to our
operations for fiscal 2014 were the euro, the British pound, Chinese yuan renminbi and the Japanese Yen. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a
weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver of the foreign currency, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely
affect certain expense figures, if taken alone.

We
use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue
and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to
exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives
not designated as hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the risk associated with
our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural hedge for offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or if the currency is too difficult or too expensive to
hedge.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2014 and 2013, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency derivative
contracts offset by underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used in performing the sensitivity analysis were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2014 and 2013.
The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange fair value loss of $62 million and
$80 million at October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013, respectively.

Interest rate risk

We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to debt we have issued and our investment portfolio and financing receivables.

We
issue long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. We often use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the
market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense.



The
swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments. However, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously
executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial.

In
order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. We may use
cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based interest income received on certain variable-rate investments. We may also enter into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest
returns into fixed-rate interest returns.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2014 and 2013, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investments, financing receivables and interest
rate swaps. The analyses use actual or approximate maturities for the debt, investments, financing receivables and interest rate swaps. The discount rates used were based on the market interest rates
in effect at October 31, 2014 and 2013. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our debt,
investments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swaps, of $80 million at October 31, 2014 and $95 million at October 31, 2013.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett-Packard Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2014
and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2014. These
financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries at
October 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Hewlett-Packard Company's internal control over financial
reporting as of October 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission (1992 framework) and our report dated December 17, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett-Packard Company

We have audited Hewlett-Packard Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2014, based on criteria
established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework) (the COSO criteria). Hewlett-Packard
Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting
included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Hewlett-Packard Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2014, based on the COSO
criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard
Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended October 31, 2014 and our report dated December 17, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

HP's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for HP. HP's
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. HP's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of HP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of HP are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of HP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of HP's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the
risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

HP's
management assessed the effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2014, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (1992 framework). Based on the assessment by HP's management, we determined that HP's
internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2014. The effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2014 has been
audited by Ernst & Young LLP, HP's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 82 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Hewlett-Packard Company ("HP") and the subsidiaries and affiliates in
which HP has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. HP accounts for investments in companies over which HP has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not hold
a controlling interest under the equity method, and HP records its proportionate share of income or losses in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. HP presents
non-controlling interests as a separate component within Total stockholder's equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Net earnings attributable to the non-controlling interests are eliminated within
Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and are not presented separately as they were not material for any period presented. HP has eliminated all intercompany accounts and
transactions.

Reclassifications

HP has made certain segment and business unit realignments in order to optimize its operating structure. Reclassifications of certain
prior-year segment and business unit financial information have been made to conform to the current-year presentation. None of the changes impacts HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue,
earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share ("EPS"). See Note 2 for a further discussion of HP's segment reorganization.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States ("U.S.") generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP")
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in HP's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from
those estimates.

Foreign Currency Translation

HP predominately uses the U.S. dollar as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are remeasured
into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities and at historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, costs and expenses denominated in
non-U.S. dollars are recorded in U.S. dollars at monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. HP includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in Interest and other, net
in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries designate the local currency as their functional currency, and HP records the translation of their assets and liabilities into
U.S. dollars at the balance sheet date as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") amended the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. The
amendments are based on the principle that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the
entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. HP is required to adopt the amendments in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

not
permitted. The amendments may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of initial application. HP is
currently evaluating the impact of these amendments and the transition alternatives on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

In
April 2014, the FASB issued guidance which changes the criteria for identifying a discontinued operation. The guidance limits the definition of a discontinued operation to the
disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on an entity's operations
and financial results. HP is required to adopt the guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2016, with early adoption permitted for transactions that have not been reported in financial statements
previously issued.

In
July 2013, the FASB issued a new accounting standard requiring the presentation of certain unrecognized tax benefits as reductions to deferred tax assets rather than as liabilities in
the Consolidated Balance Sheets when a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward exists. HP is required to adopt this new standard on a prospective basis in the
first quarter of fiscal 2015; however, early adoption is permitted as is retrospective application. HP will adopt the new standard in the first fiscal quarter of 2015 on a prospective basis. Adoption
of the new standard is not expected to have a material effect on HP's Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

General

HP recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales
price or fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, HP recognizes hardware revenue on sales to channel partners, including resellers, distributors or
value-added solution providers at the time of delivery when the channel partners have economic substance apart from HP, and HP has completed its obligations related to the sale. HP generally
recognizes revenue for its standalone software sales to channel partners on receipt of evidence that the software has been sold to a specific end user. HP limits the amount of revenue recognized for
delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations or subject to customer-specified refund or return rights.

HP
reduces revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, rebates, promotions, other volume-based incentives and expected returns.
Future market conditions and product transitions may require HP to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the
incentive is offered. For certain incentive programs, HP estimates the number of customers expected to redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of the
incentive.

In
instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor products or services, HP records revenue on a gross basis when HP is a principal to the transaction and on a net
basis when HP is acting as an agent between the customer and the vendor. HP considers several factors to determine whether it is acting as a principal or an agent, most notably whether HP is the
primary obligor to the customer, has established its own pricing and has inventory and credit risks.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

HP
reports revenue net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the
relevant government authority.

Multiple element arrangements

When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements or deliverables, such as hardware and software products, and/or services, HP
allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of selling price, if available,
third party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE of selling price is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP") if neither VSOE of selling price nor TPE is available. HP establishes VSOE of selling price
using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant authority. HP establishes TPE of selling price by
evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. HP establishes ESP based on management judgment considering internal
factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product life cycle. Consideration is also given to market conditions, such as competitor
pricing strategies and technology life cycles. In arrangements with multiple elements, HP allocates the transaction price to the individual units of accounting at inception of the arrangement based on
their relative selling price.

In
multiple element arrangements that include software that is more-than-incidental, HP allocates the transaction price to the individual units of accounting for the non-software
deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling price of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the selling price hierarchy. If the arrangement
contains more than one software deliverable, the transaction price allocated to the group of software deliverables is then allocated to each component software deliverable.

HP
evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has
standalone value to the customer. For elements with no standalone value, HP recognizes revenue consistent with the pattern of the associated deliverables. If the arrangement includes a
customer-negotiated refund or return right or other contingency relative to the delivered items, and the delivery and performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially
within HP's control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In arrangements with combined units of accounting, changes in the allocation of the transaction price between
elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition for the contract but will not change the total revenue recognized for the contract.

Product revenue

Hardware

Under HP's standard terms and conditions of sale, HP transfers title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is delivered
to the customer and recognizes revenue accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations to the customer remain. HP reduces revenue for estimated customer returns, price
protection, rebates and other programs offered under sales agreements established by HP with its distributors and resellers. HP records revenue from the sale of equipment under sales-type leases as
product revenue at the inception of the lease. HP accrues the



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

estimated
cost of post-sale obligations, including standard product warranties, based on historical experience at the time HP recognizes revenue.

Software

HP recognizes revenue from perpetual software licenses at the inception of the license term, assuming all revenue recognition criteria
have been satisfied. Term-based software license revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the license. HP uses the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at inception
of the arrangement when VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements, such as post-contract support, exists and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. HP recognizes revenue
from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates provided on a when-and-if-available basis ratably over the period during which such items are delivered.

HP
recognizes revenue for hosting or software-as-a-service ("SaaS") arrangements as the service is delivered, generally on a straight-line basis, over the contractual period of
performance. In hosting arrangements where software licenses are sold, HP recognizes the license revenue according to whether perpetual or term licenses are sold, when all other revenue recognition
criteria are satisfied. In hosting arrangements that include software licenses, HP considers the rights provided to the customer (e.g., ownership of a license, contract termination provisions
and the feasibility of the customer to operate the software) in determining when to recognize revenue for the licenses.

Services revenue

HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software
post-contract customer support agreements, ratably over the contract period and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred. For time and material contracts, HP recognizes revenue
as services are rendered and recognizes costs as they are incurred.

HP
recognizes revenue from certain fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements, as work progresses over the contract period on a proportional performance basis, as determined
by the percentage of labor costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated contract labor costs of a contract. HP recognizes revenue on fixed-price contracts for design and build projects (to
design, develop and construct software and systems) using the percentage-of-completion method. HP uses the cost-to-cost method to measure progress toward completion as determined by the percentage of
cost incurred to date compared to the total estimated costs of the project. Estimates of total project costs for fixed-price contracts are regularly revised during the life of a contract. Provisions
for estimated losses on fixed-priced contracts are recognized in the period when such losses become known. If reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made, HP uses the completed
contract method and recognizes revenue and costs upon service completion.

HP
generally recognizes outsourcing services revenue in the period when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent on the occurrence of any future event. HP
recognizes revenue using an objective measure of output for unit-priced contracts. Revenue for fixed-price outsourcing contracts with periodic billings is recognized on a straight-line basis if the
service is provided evenly during the contract term. Provisions for estimated losses on outsourcing arrangements are recognized in the period when such losses become probable and estimable.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

HP
recognizes revenue from operating leases on a straight-line basis as service revenue over the rental period.

Financing income

Sales-type and direct-financing leases produce financing income, which HP recognizes at consistent rates of return over the lease term.

Deferred revenue and deferred costs

HP records amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are
satisfied. HP records revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on services contracts as trade receivables.

Deferred
revenue represents amounts invoiced in advance for product support contracts, software customer support contracts, outsourcing startup services work, consulting and integration
projects, product sales or leasing income.

HP
recognizes costs associated with outsourcing contracts as incurred, unless such costs are considered direct and incremental to the startup phase of the contract, in which case HP
defers these costs during the startup phase and subsequently amortizes such costs over the period that outsourcing services are provided, once those services commence. HP amortizes deferred contract
costs on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of the contract unless facts and circumstances of the contract indicate a shorter period is more appropriate. Based on actual and projected
contract financial performance indicators, HP analyzes the recoverability of deferred contract costs using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract over its remaining term. If such
undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of deferred contract costs and long-lived assets directly associated with the contract, the deferred contract costs are first
impaired. If a cash flow deficiency remains after reducing the carrying amount of the deferred contract costs to zero, HP evaluates any remaining long-lived assets related to that contract for
impairment.

Shipping and Handling

HP includes costs related to shipping and handling in cost of sales.

Stock-Based Compensation

HP determines stock-based compensation expense based on the measurement date fair value of the award. HP recognizes compensation cost
only for those awards expected to meet the service and performance vesting conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. HP determines compensation costs at the
aggregate grant level for service-based awards and at the individual vesting tranche level for awards with performance and/or market conditions. HP estimates the forfeiture rate based on its
historical experience.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans

HP has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory retirement and post-retirement plans. HP generally amortizes
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the average remaining estimated service life of participants. In some cases, HP amortizes actuarial



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

gains
and losses using the corridor approach. See Note 4 for a full description of these plans and the accounting and funding policies.

Advertising

Costs to produce advertising are expensed as incurred during production. Costs to communicate advertising are expensed when the
advertising is first run. Such costs totaled approximately $784 million in fiscal 2014, $878 million in fiscal 2013 and $1.0 billion in fiscal 2012.

Restructuring

HP records charges associated with management-approved restructuring plans to reorganize one or more of HP's business segments, to
remove duplicative headcount and infrastructure associated with business acquisitions or to simplify business processes and accelerate innovation. Restructuring charges can include severance costs to
eliminate a specified number of employees, infrastructure charges to vacate facilities and consolidate operations, and contract cancellation costs. HP records restructuring charges based on estimated
employee terminations and site closure and consolidation plans. HP accrues for severance and other employee separation costs under these actions when it is probable that benefits will be paid and the
amount is reasonably estimable. The rates used in determing severance accruals are based on existing plans, historical experiences and negotiated settlements.

Taxes on Earnings

HP recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. HP records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax
assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

HP
records accruals for uncertain tax positions when HP believes that it is not more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities
based on the technical merits of the position. HP makes adjustments to these accruals when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate. The
provision for income taxes includes the effects of adjustments for uncertain tax positions, as well as any related interest and penalties.

Accounts Receivable

HP establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable. HP records a specific reserve for individual accounts when
HP becomes aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If there are additional
changes in circumstances related to the specific customer, HP further adjusts estimates of the recoverability of receivables. HP maintains bad debt reserves for all other customers based on a variety
of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk
models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, the financial condition of customers, the length of time receivables are past due, trends in the
weighted-average risk rating for the portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, information derived from competitive benchmarking, significant one-time events and historical experience. The past due or
delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

HP
has third-party revolving short-term financing arrangements intended to facilitate the working capital requirements of certain customers. These financing arrangements, which in
certain cases provide for partial recourse, result in the transfer of HP's trade receivables to a third party. HP reflects amounts transferred to, but not yet collected from, the third party in
accounts receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For arrangements involving an element of recourse, the fair value of the recourse obligation is measured using market data from similar
transactions and reported as a current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Concentrations of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject HP to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents, investments, receivables from trade customers and contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.

HP
maintains cash and cash equivalents, investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These financial institutions are located in
many different geographic regions, and HP's policy is designed to limit exposure from any particular institution. As part of its risk management processes, HP performs periodic evaluations of the
relative credit standing of these financial institutions. HP has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at these financial institutions. HP utilizes derivative contracts to protect
against the effects of foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result in a material loss.

HP
sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant receivable balances with these parties.
If the financial condition or operations of these distributors' and resellers' aggregated business deteriorates substantially, HP's operating results could be adversely affected. The ten largest
distributor and reseller receivable balances, which were concentrated primarily in North America and Europe, collectively represented approximately 20% and 21% of gross accounts receivable at
October 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. No
single customer accounts for more than 10% of gross accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable and financing receivables is generally diversified due to the large
number of entities comprising HP's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic regions. HP performs ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of its
third-party distributors, resellers and other customers and may require collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances.

HP
utilizes outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. HP may purchase product components from suppliers and sell those components to its outsourced
manufacturers thereby creating receivable balances from the outsourced manufacturers. The three largest outsourced manufacturer receivable balances collectively represented 90% and 82% of HP's
supplier receivables of $1.0 billion and $1.0 billion at October 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. HP includes the supplier receivables in Other current assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets on a gross basis. HP's credit risk associated with these receivables is mitigated wholly or in part, by the amount HP owes to these outsourced manufacturers, as HP generally has the
legal right to offset its payables to the outsourced manufacturers against these receivables. HP does not reflect the sale of these components in revenue and does not recognize any profit on these
component sales until the related products are sold by HP, at which time any profit is recognized as a reduction to cost of sales.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

HP
obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. The loss of a single source supplier,
the deterioration of HP's relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which HP is supplied components by a single source supplier could
adversely affect HP's revenue and gross margins.

Inventory

HP values inventory at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first-in,
first-out basis. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolete or impaired balances.

Property, Plant and Equipment

HP states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. HP capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses
maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are five to 40 years for
buildings and improvements and three to 15 years for machinery and equipment. HP depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. HP depreciates
equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. The estimated useful lives of assets used solely to support a customer services contract
generally do not exceed the term of the customer contract. On retirement or disposition, the asset cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the Consolidated Balance Sheets with any
gain or loss recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

HP
capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and
installation and testing of the software. HP amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally from three to
five years.

Software Development Costs

HP capitalizes costs incurred to acquire or develop software for resale subsequent to establishing technological feasibility for the
software, if significant. HP amortizes capitalized software development costs using the greater of the straight-line amortization method or the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to
the total current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product. The estimated useful life for capitalized software for resale is generally three years or less. Software development costs
incurred subsequent to establishing technological feasibility are generally not significant.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Business Combinations

HP includes the results of operations of acquired businesses in HP's consolidated results prospectively from the date of acquisition.
HP allocates the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity generally based on their fair values at the
acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of these assets acquired, liabilities assumed and non-controlling interests in the acquired entity is
recorded as goodwill. The primary items that generate goodwill include the value of the synergies between the acquired company and HP and the value of the acquired assembled workforce, neither of
which qualifies for recognition as an intangible asset. Acquisition-related expenses and post-acquisition restructuring costs are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed
as incurred.

Goodwill

HP reviews goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill
may not be recoverable. While HP is permitted to conduct a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test, for its annual
goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, HP performed a quantitative test for all of its reporting units.

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. At the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2014, HP made a change to its reporting units. In connection with continued
operational synergies and interdependencies between the Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking reporting unit and the Technology Services ("TS") reporting unit within the Enterprise Group ("EG")
segment, HP combined these reporting units to create the EG reporting unit. As of October 31, 2014, HP's reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2,
except for Enterprise Services ("ES"), which consists of two reporting units: MphasiS Limited and the remainder of ES.

In
the first step of the impairment test, HP compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount. HP estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a weighting
of fair values derived most significantly from the income approach, and to a lesser extent, the market approach. Under the income approach, HP estimates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the
present value of estimated future cash flows. HP bases cash flow projections on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market
conditions. HP bases the discount rate on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the
reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, HP estimates fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable
publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit. HP weights the fair value derived from
the market approach depending on the level of comparability of these publicly-traded companies to the reporting unit. When market comparables are not meaningful or not available, HP estimates the fair
value of a reporting unit using only the income approach. For the MphasiS Limited reporting unit, HP utilized the quoted market price in an active market to estimate fair value.

In
order to assess the reasonableness of the estimated fair value of HP's reporting units, HP compares the aggregate reporting unit fair value to HP's market capitalization and
calculates an implied control premium (the excess of the sum of the reporting units' fair value over HP's market



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

capitalization).
HP evaluates the control premium by comparing it to observable control premiums from recent comparable transactions. If the implied control premium is not believed to be reasonable in
light of these recent transactions, HP reevaluates reporting unit fair values, which may result in an adjustment to the discount rate and/or other assumptions. This reevaluation could result in a
change to the estimated fair value for certain or all reporting units.

If
the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the
fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then HP performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. In the second
step, HP measures the reporting unit's assets, including any unrecognized intangible assets, liabilities and non-controlling interests at fair value in a hypothetical analysis to calculate the implied
fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is
less than its carrying amount, the difference is recorded as an impairment loss.

Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets

HP reviews intangible assets with finite lives and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. HP assesses the recoverability of assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and
eventual disposition of the asset. If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount, the asset is impaired. HP measures the amount of impairment loss, if any, as the difference
between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value using an income approach or, when available and appropriate, using a market approach. HP amortizes intangible assets with finite lives using
the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from one to ten years.

Debt and Marketable Equity Securities Investments

Debt and marketable equity securities are generally considered available-for-sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains
and losses, net of applicable taxes, in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are calculated based on the
specific identification method and included in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. HP monitors its investment portfolio for potential impairment on a quarterly basis.
When the carrying amount of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary (i.e., when HP does not intend to sell the
debt securities and it is not more likely than not that HP will be required to sell the debt securities prior to anticipated recovery of its amortized cost basis), HP records an impairment charge to
Interest and other, net in the amount of the credit loss and the balance, if any, is recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivatives

HP uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and options, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate
exposures. HP also may use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges, such as forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. HP



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

does
not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 11 for a full description of HP's derivative financial instrument activities and related accounting policies.

Loss Contingencies

HP is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP records a
liability for contingencies when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. See Note 15 for a full description of
HP's loss contingencies and related accounting policies.

Note 2: Segment Information

HP is a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses ("SMBs") and large enterprises,
including customers in the government, health and education sectors. HP's offerings span personal computing and other access devices; imaging- and printing-related products and services; enterprise
information technology ("IT") infrastructure, including enterprise server and storage technology, networking products and solutions, and technology support and maintenance; multi-vendor customer
services, including technology consulting, outsourcing and support services across infrastructure, applications and business process domains; and IT management software, application testing and

HP's
operations are organized into seven segments for financial reporting purposes: Personal Systems, Printing, the EG, ES, Software, HP Financial Services ("HPFS") and Corporate
Investments. HP's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that management uses to evaluate, view and run its business operations, which include, but are not limited to, customer base
and homogeneity of products and technology. The segments are based on this organizational structure and information reviewed by HP's management to evaluate segment results.

The
Personal Systems segment and the Printing segment are structured beneath a broader Printing and Personal Systems Group ("PPS"). While PPS is not a reportable segment, HP may provide
financial data aggregating the Personal Systems and the Printing segments in order to provide a supplementary view of its business.

A
summary description of each segment follows.

Segment Policy

HP derives the results of the business segments directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting
policies HP uses to derive segment results are substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. Management measures the performance of each segment based on several metrics,
including earnings from operations. Management uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to allocate resources to, each of the segments.

Segment
revenue includes revenues from sales to external customers and intersegment revenues that reflect transactions between the segments on an arm's-length basis. Intersegment
revenues primarily consist of sales of hardware and software that are sourced internally and, in the majority of the cases, are financed as operating leases by HPFS. HP's consolidated net revenue is
derived and reported after the elimination of intersegment revenues from such arrangements.

HP
periodically engages in intercompany licensing arrangements that may result in advance payments between subsidiaries. Revenues from intercompany licensing arrangements are deferred
and recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement by the legal entities involved in such transactions; however,
these payments are eliminated from revenues as reported by HP and its business segments. As disclosed in Note 6, during fiscal 2014, HP executed a multi-year intercompany licensing



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 2: Segment Information (Continued)

arrangement
on which advanced royalty payments of $10.4 billion were received in the U.S. from a foreign consolidated affiliate. Deferred intercompany royalty revenues of $9.9 billion will be
recognized over the life of the arrangement through 2029 in the respective legal entities, but eliminated from both HP consolidated and segment revenues.

Financing
interest in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings reflects interest expense on debt attributable to HPFS. Debt attributable to HPFS consists of intercompany equity that is
treated as debt for segment reporting purposes, intercompany debt, and borrowing- and funding-related activity associated with HPFS and its subsidiaries.

HP
does not allocate to its segments certain operating expenses, which it manages at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include certain corporate governance costs, stock-based
compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring charges and acquisition-related charges.

Segment Realignment

Effective at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2014, HP implemented certain organizational changes to align its segment
financial reporting more closely with its current business structure. These organizational changes include:

•

transferring the HP Exstream business from the Commercial Hardware business unit within the Printing segment to the
Software segment;

•

transferring the Personal Systems trade and warranty support business from the TS business unit within the EG segment to
the Other business unit within the Personal Systems segment;

•

transferring the spare and replacement parts business supporting the Personal Systems and Printing segments from the TS
business unit within the EG segment to the Other business unit within the Personal Systems segment and the Commercial Hardware business unit within the Printing segment, respectively;

•

transferring certain cloud-related incubation activities previously reported in Corporate and unallocated costs and
eliminations and in the EG segment to the Corporate Investments segment.

In
addition, HP transferred certain intrasegment eliminations from the ES segment and the EG segment to corporate intersegment revenue eliminations.

HP
has reflected these changes to its segment information retrospectively to the earliest period presented, which has resulted in the transfer of revenue among the Printing, Personal
Systems, EG, ES and Software segments and the transfer of operating profit among the Printing, Personal Systems, EG, Software and Corporate Investments segments. These changes had no impact on the
previously reported financial results for the HPFS segment. In addition, none of these changes impacted HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net
EPS.

Fiscal 2012 Restructuring Plan

On May 23, 2012, HP adopted a multi-year restructuring plan (the "2012 Plan") designed to simplify business processes,
accelerate innovation and deliver better results for customers, employees and stockholders. As of October 31, 2013, HP estimated that it would eliminate approximately 34,000 positions in
connection with the 2012 Plan through fiscal 2014, with a portion of those employees exiting the company as part of voluntary enhanced early retirement ("EER") programs in the U.S. and in certain
other countries. As of October 31, 2013, HP estimated that it would recognize approximately $4.1 billion in aggregate charges in connection with the 2012 Plan.

In
fiscal 2014, HP increased the expected number of positions to be eliminated to 55,000 as HP continued to optimize the workforce and reengineer business processes to be more
competitive and meet its objectives. As a result, as of October 31, 2014, HP estimates that it will recognize approximately $5.5 billion in aggregate charges in connection with the 2012
Plan. As of October 31, 2014, HP had recorded $4.9 billion in aggregate charges of which $4.4 billion related to workforce reductions and $515 million related to
infrastructure, including data center and real estate consolidation, and other items. As of October 31, 2014, HP had eliminated approximately 40,900 positions for which a severance payment has
been or will be made as part of the 2012 Plan. The severance- and infrastructure-related cash payments associated with the 2012 Plan are expected to be paid out through fiscal 2021.

Note 3: Restructuring (Continued)

Other Plans

Restructuring plans initiated by HP in fiscal 2008 and 2010 were substantially completed as of October 31, 2014. Severance- and
infrastructure-related cash payments associated with the other plans are expected to be paid out through fiscal 2019.

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Defined Benefit Plans

HP sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans worldwide, of which the most significant are in the United States. Both the HP
Pension Plan ("Pension Plan"), a defined benefit pension plan under which benefits are based on pay and years of service, and the HP Company Cash Account Pension Plan ("Cash Account Pension Plan"),
under which benefits are accrued pursuant to a formula based on a percentage of pay plus interest, were frozen effective January 1, 2008. The Cash Account Pension Plan was merged into the HP
Pension Plan in 2005 for
certain funding and investment purposes. Effective October 30, 2009 the Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") U.S. qualified pension plan was also merged into the Pension Plan. The EDS
pension plan was frozen effective January 1, 2009.

HP
reduces the benefit payable to certain U.S. employees under the Pension Plan for service before 1993, if any, by any amounts due to the employee under HP's frozen defined contribution
Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("DPSP"). HP closed the DPSP to new participants in 1993. The DPSP plan obligations are equal to the plan assets and are recognized as an offset to the Pension Plan when
HP calculates its defined benefit pension cost and obligations. The fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit plans combined with the DPSP were as
follows:

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

HP sponsors retiree health and welfare benefit plans, of which the most significant are in the U.S. Under the HP Retiree Welfare
Benefits Plan, certain pre-2003 retirees and grandfathered participants with continuous service to HP since 2002 are eligible to receive partially-subsidized medical coverage based on years of service
at retirement. Former grandfathered employees of Digital Equipment Corporation also receive partially-subsidized medical benefits that are not service-based. HP's share of the premium cost is capped
for all subsidized medical coverage provided under the HP Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan. HP currently leverages the employer group waiver plan process to provide HP Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan
post-65 prescription drug coverage under Medicare Part D, thereby giving HP access to federal subsidies to help pay for retiree benefits.

Certain
employees not grandfathered under the above programs, as well as employees hired after 2002 but before August 2008, are eligible for credits under the HP Retirement Medical
Savings Account Plan ("RMSA") upon attaining age 45. Credits offered after September 2008 are provided in the form of matching credits on employee contributions made to a voluntary employee
beneficiary association. On retirement, former employees may use these credits for the reimbursement of certain eligible medical expenses, including premiums required for coverage.

Defined Contribution Plans

HP offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution expense was
$573 million in fiscal 2014, $603 million in fiscal 2013 and $628 million in fiscal 2012. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Company 401(k) Plan ("HP
401(k) Plan") when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation.

The
quarterly employer matching contributions in the HP 401(K) Plan are 100% of an employee's contributions, up to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation.

For
the U.S. defined benefit plan, HP adopted a new mortality rate table in fiscal 2014 to better reflect expected lifetimes of its U.S. plan participants. The table used is based on a
historical demographic study of the plans and increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $870 million. The increase in the projected benefit obligation was recognized as a part
of the net actuarial loss as included in the other comprehensive loss which will be amortized over the remaining estimated life of plan participants (approximately 26.5 years).

The
net amounts recognized for HP's defined benefit and post-retirement benefit plans in HP's Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:

Retirement Incentive Program

As part of the 2012 restructuring plan, the company announced a voluntary enhanced early retirement program for its U.S employees.
Participation in the EER program was limited to those employees whose combined age and years of service equaled 65 or more. Approximately 8,500 employees elected to participate in the EER program and
left the company on dates designated by the company, with the majority of the EER participants having left the company on August 31, 2012 and others exiting through August 31, 2013. The
HP Pension Plan was amended to provide for an EER benefit from the plan for electing EER participants who were current participants in the plan. The retirement incentive benefit was calculated as a
lump sum and ranged between five and fourteen months of pay depending on years of service at the time of retirement under the program. As a result of this retirement incentive, HP recognized a special
termination benefit ("STB") of $833 million, which reflected the present value of all additional benefits that HP would distribute from the HP Pension Plan. HP recorded these expenses as a
restructuring charge. In addition, the HP Pension Plan was remeasured on June 30, 2012, which resulted in no material change to the 2012 net periodic benefit cost or funded status.

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

HP extended to all employees participating in the EER program the opportunity to continue health care coverage at active employee contribution rates for up to 24 months following
retirement. In addition, for employees not grandfathered into certain employer-subsidized retiree medical plans, HP provided up to $12,000 in employer credits under the RMSA. These items resulted in
an additional special termination benefit STB expense of $227 million, which was offset by net curtailment gains of
$37 million, due primarily to the resulting accelerated recognition of the existing prior service benefit. The entire STB and approximately $30 million in curtailment gains were
recognized in fiscal 2012. HP reported this net expense as a restructuring charge in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

The
following is a description of the valuation methodologies used to measure plan assets at fair value. There have been no changes in the methodologies used during the reporting period.

Investments
in publicly-traded equity securities are valued using the closing price on the measurement date as reported on the stock exchange on which the individual securities are
traded. For corporate, government and asset-backed debt securities, fair value is based on observable inputs of comparable market transactions. For corporate and government debt securities traded on
active exchanges, fair value is based on observable quoted prices. The valuation of alternative investments, such as limited partnerships and joint ventures, may require significant management
judgment. For alternative investments, valuation is based on net asset value ("NAV") as reported by the Asset Manager and adjusted for cash flows, if necessary. In making such an assessment, a variety
of factors are reviewed by management, including, but not limited to, the timeliness of NAV as reported by the asset manager and changes in general economic and market conditions subsequent to the
last NAV reported by the asset manager. Depending on the amount of management judgment, the lack of near-term liquidity, and the absence of quoted market prices, these assets are classified in
Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Further, depending on how quickly HP can redeem its hedge fund investments, and the extent of any adjustments to NAV, hedge funds are
classified in either Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Common collective trusts, interests in 103-12 entities and registered investment companies are valued at NAV. The
valuation for some of these assets requires judgment due

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

to
the absence of quoted market prices, and these assets are generally classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Cash and cash equivalents includes money market funds, which are valued
based on NAV. Other assets, including insurance group annuity contracts, were classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input (e.g., quoted prices and observable inputs)
that is significant to the fair value measure in its entirety.

Investment Policy

HP's investment strategy is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk depending on the funded
status of each plan and the timing of expected benefit payments. The majority of the plans' investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad
markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the
plans' investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and HP may utilize derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment
or liability exposures.

The
target asset allocation selected for each U.S. plan reflects a risk/return profile HP believes is appropriate relative to each plan's liability structure and return goals. HP
conducts periodic asset-liability studies for U.S. plans in order to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plan's forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs. HP invests a
portion of the U.S. defined benefit
plan assets and post-retirement benefit plan assets in private market securities such as private equity funds to provide diversification and a higher expected return on assets.

Outside
the U.S., asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees for the specific plan. As in the U.S., investment objectives are designed to generate
returns that will enable the plan to meet its future obligations. In some countries, local regulations may restrict asset allocations, typically leading to a higher percentage of investment in fixed
income securities than would otherwise be deployed. HP reviews the investment strategy and provides a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions on asset
allocation and investment managers made by the board of trustees for the specific plan.

Note 4: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests
and the weight of each asset class in the target mix. Expected asset returns reflect the current yield on government bonds, risk premiums for each asset class and expected real returns which considers
each country's specific inflation outlook. Because HP's investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the expected returns are adjusted
to reflect the expected additional returns net of fees.

Future Contributions and Funding Policy

In fiscal 2015, HP expects to contribute approximately $686 million to its non-U.S. pension plans and approximately
$35 million to cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants. HP expects to pay approximately $47 million to cover benefit claims for HP's post-retirement benefit plans.
HP's policy is to fund its pension plans so that it makes at least the minimum contribution required by local government, funding and taxing authorities.

Estimated Future Benefits Payments

As of October 31, 2014, HP estimates that the future benefits payments for the retirement and post-retirement plans are as
follows:

received from option exercises and purchases under the Hewlett-Packard Company 2011 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "2011 ESPP") was $0.3 billion in fiscal 2014,
$0.3 billion in fiscal 2013 and $0.7 billion in fiscal 2012. The benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $51 million,
$13 million and $57 million, respectively.

Stock-Based Incentive Compensation Plans

HP's stock-based incentive compensation plans include equity plans adopted in 2004, 2000 and 1995, as amended ("principal equity
plans"), as well as various equity plans assumed through acquisitions under which stock-based awards are outstanding. Stock-based awards granted from the principal equity plans include restricted
stock awards, stock options and performance-based awards. Employees meeting certain employment qualifications are eligible to receive stock-based awards.

Restricted
stock awards are non-vested stock awards that may include grants of restricted stock or restricted stock units. Restricted stock awards and cash-settled awards are generally
subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the lapse of the restrictions. Such awards generally vest one to three years from the date of grant. During the vesting period, ownership of the
restricted stock cannot be transferred. Restricted stock has the same dividend and voting rights as common stock and is considered to be issued and outstanding upon grant. The dividends paid on
restricted stock are non-forfeitable. Restricted stock units have forfeitable dividend equivalent rights equal to the dividend paid on common stock. Restricted stock units do not have the voting
rights of common stock, and the shares underlying restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding upon grant. However, shares underlying restricted stock units are included in the
calculation of diluted net EPS. HP expenses the fair value of restricted stock awards ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.

Stock
options granted under the principal equity plans are generally non-qualified stock options, but the principal equity plans permit some options granted to qualify as incentive stock
options under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Stock options generally vest over three to four years from the date of grant. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the closing price of HP's
stock on the option grant date. The majority of stock options issued by HP contain only service vesting conditions. However, starting in fiscal 2011, HP began granting performance-contingent stock
options that vest only on the satisfaction of both service and market conditions prior to the expiration of the awards.

The
total grant date fair value of restricted stock awards vested in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $234 million, $247 million and $229 million, respectively, net of
taxes. As of October 31, 2014, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to non-vested restricted stock awards was $511 million, which is expected to be
recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.4 years.

Stock Options

HP utilizes the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock options subject to service-based
vesting conditions. HP estimates the fair value of stock options subject to performance-contingent vesting conditions using a combination of a Monte Carlo simulation model and a lattice model as these
awards contain market conditions. The weighted-average fair value and the assumptions used to measure fair value were as follows:

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that option holders would have received had all option holders exercised their options on
the last trading day of fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. The aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between HP's closing stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal year and the exercise price,
multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $151 million, $36 million and $176 million,
respectively. The total grant date fair value of options vested in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $53 million, $64 million and $104 million, respectively, net of taxes.

As
of October 31, 2014, total unrecognized pre-tax stock-based compensation expense related to stock options was $61 million, which is expected to be recognized over a
weighted-average vesting period of 2.0 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

HP sponsors the 2011 ESPP, pursuant to which eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of base compensation, subject to certain
income limits, to purchase shares of HP's common stock.

Pursuant
to the terms of the 2011 ESPP, employees purchase stock under the 2011 ESPP at a price equal to 95% of HP's closing stock price on the purchase date. No stock-based compensation
expense was recorded in connection with those purchases because the criteria of a non-compensatory plan were met.

Shares Reserved

Shares available for future grant and shares reserved for future issuance under the stock-based incentive compensation plans and the

Note 6: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)

The
jurisdictions with favorable tax rates that have the most significant impact on HP's effective tax rate in the periods presented include Puerto Rico, Singapore, Netherlands, China
and Ireland. HP plans to reinvest some of the earnings of these jurisdictions indefinitely outside the U.S. and therefore has not provided U.S. taxes on those indefinitely reinvested earnings.

In
fiscal 2014, HP recorded $53 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year.

In
fiscal 2013, HP recorded $471 million of net income tax charges related to items unique to the year. These amounts included $214 million of net increases to valuation
allowances, $406 million of tax charges for adjustments to uncertain tax positions and the settlement of tax audit matters and $47 million of tax charges for various prior period
adjustments. In addition, HP recorded $146 million of tax benefits from adjustments to prior year foreign income tax accruals and a tax benefit of $50 million arising from the
retroactive research and development credit resulting from the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which was signed into law in January 2013.

In
fiscal 2012, HP recorded a $1.3 billion income tax charge to record valuation allowances on certain U.S. deferred tax assets related to the ES segment, which was unique to the
year. Other unique items included charges of $297 million for various foreign valuation allowances, as well as $26 million of income tax benefits related to adjustments to prior year
foreign income tax accruals, settlement of tax audit matters, and miscellaneous other items.

As
a result of certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in
some cases is wholly exempt from taxes, through 2024. The gross income tax benefits attributable to these actions and investments were estimated to be $1.2 billion ($0.61 diluted net EPS) in
fiscal 2014, $827 million ($0.42 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2013 and $900 million ($0.46 diluted net EPS) in fiscal 2012.

recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits in Provision for taxes in the Consolidated Statements of
Earnings. HP had accrued $254 million and $196 million for interest and penalties as of October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013, respectively.

HP
engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in various jurisdictions. HP does not expect complete resolution of any U.S. Internal
Revenue Service ("IRS") audit cycle within the next 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that certain federal, foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next
12 months, including issues involving transfer pricing and other matters. Accordingly, HP believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by an
amount up to $1.4 billion within the next 12 months.

HP
is subject to income tax in the U.S. and approximately 105 other countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. In addition, HP is
subject to numerous ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The IRS is conducting an audit of HP's
2009, 2010 and 2011 income tax returns. HP has received from the IRS Notices of Deficiency for its fiscal 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005 tax years, and Revenue Agent Reports ("RAR") for its fiscal
2001, 2002, 2006, 2007 and 2008 tax years. The proposed IRS adjustments for these tax years would, if sustained, reduce the benefits of tax refund claims HP has filed for net operating loss carrybacks
to earlier fiscal years and tax credit carryforwards to subsequent years by approximately $445 million. In addition, HP expects the IRS to issue an RAR for 2009 relating to certain tax
positions taken on the filed tax returns, including matters related to the U.S. taxation of certain intercompany loans. While the RAR may be material in amount, HP believes it has valid positions
supporting its tax returns and, if necessary, it will vigorously defend such matters.

HP
has filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court regarding certain proposed IRS adjustments regarding tax years 1999 through 2003 and is continuing to contest additional adjustments
proposed by the IRS for other tax years. The U.S. Tax Court ruled in May 2012 against HP regarding one of the IRS adjustments for which HP has filed a formal Notice of Appeal. The Court proceedings
are expected to begin in fiscal 2015.

Pre-acquisition
tax years of HP's U.S. group of subsidiaries providing enterprise services through 2004 have been audited by the IRS, and all proposed adjustments have been resolved.
RARs have been received for tax years 2005, 2006, 2007 and the short period ended August 26, 2008, proposing total tax deficiencies of $274 million. HP is contesting certain of these
issues.

The
IRS began an audit in fiscal 2013 of the 2010 income tax return for HP's U.S. group of subsidiaries providing enterprise services, and has issued an RAR for the short period ended
October 31, 2008 and the period ending October 31, 2009 proposing a total tax deficiency of $62 million. HP is contesting certain of these issues.

With
respect to major foreign and state tax jurisdictions, HP is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 1999. HP is subject to a foreign tax audit concerning
an intercompany transaction for fiscal 2009. The relevant taxing authority has proposed an assessment of approximately $680 million. HP is contesting this proposed assessment.

HP
believes it has provided adequate reserves for all tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from federal, state and foreign tax audits. HP regularly assesses
the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of HP's tax provision. HP adjusts its uncertain

Note 6: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)

tax
positions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular audit. However, income tax audits are
inherently unpredictable and there can be no assurance that HP will accurately predict the outcome of these audits. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different
from the amounts previously included in the Provision for taxes and therefore the resolution of one or more of these uncertainties in any particular period could have a material impact on net income
or cash flows.

HP
has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $42.9 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of October 31, 2014 because
HP intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If HP were to distribute these earnings, foreign tax credits may become available under current law to reduce the resulting U.S.
income tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. HP will remit non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of its
non-U.S. subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. federal and withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and HP determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax
or cash management reasons.

Tax
deficits of approximately $43 million, $149 million and $175 million were recorded as a result of employee stock program activity and exercise of employee stock
options, as a decrease in stockholders' equity in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

HP
periodically engages in intercompany licensing arrangements that may result in advance payments between subsidiaries in different tax jurisdictions. When the local tax treatment of
the intercompany licensing arrangements differs from their U.S. GAAP treatment, deferred taxes are recognized. During fiscal 2014, HP executed a multi-year intercompany licensing arrangement on
which advanced royalty payments of $10.4 billion were received in the U.S., the result of which was the recognition of net U.S. long-term deferred tax assets of $1.3 billion. The
remaining intercompany royalty revenues of $9.9 billion will be recognized over the life of the arrangement through 2029 in the respective legal entities and eliminated in consolidation. The
amortization expense related to the licensing rights will also be eliminated in consolidation. The decrease in deferred tax assets for credit carryforwards and increase in deferred tax assets for
intercompany transactions excluding inventory include the deferred tax attributable to this transaction. This results in an increase in long-term deferred tax assets which is presented as a component
of HP's long-term deferred tax liabilities due to the effects of jurisdictional netting.

As
of October 31, 2014, HP had $858 million, $4.2 billion and $29.7 billion of federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, respectively.
Amounts included in federal net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2021 and amounts included in state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in
2015. HP also has a capital loss carryforward of approximately $272 million which will expire in fiscal 2015. HP has provided a valuation allowance of $133 million and $8.7 billion for
deferred tax assets related to state and foreign net operating losses carryforwards, respectively and $104 million for deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards that HP does not
expect to realize.

Note 8: Financing Receivables and Operating Leases (Continued)

Credit Quality Indicators

Due to the homogenous nature of its leasing transactions, HP manages its financing receivables on an aggregate basis when assessing and
monitoring credit risk. Credit risk is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising HP's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographic
regions. HP evaluates the credit quality of an obligor at lease inception and monitors that credit quality over the term of a transaction. HP assigns
risk ratings to each lease based on the creditworthiness of the obligor and other variables that augment or mitigate the inherent credit risk of a particular transaction. Such variables include the
underlying value and liquidity of the collateral, the essential use of the equipment, the term of the lease, and the inclusion of credit enhancements, such as guarantees, letters of credit or security
deposits.

The
credit risk profile of gross financing receivables, based on internally assigned ratings, was as follows:

Accounts
rated low risk typically have the equivalent of a Standard & Poor's rating of BBB- or higher, while accounts rated moderate risk generally have the equivalent
of BB+ or lower. HP classifies accounts as high risk when it considers the financing receivable to be impaired or when management believes there is a significant near-term risk of impairment.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts for financing receivables is comprised of a general reserve and a specific reserve. HP maintains
general reserve percentages on a regional basis and bases such percentages on several factors, including consideration of historical credit losses and portfolio delinquencies, trends in the overall
weighted-average risk rating of the portfolio, current economic conditions and information derived from competitive benchmarking. HP excludes accounts evaluated as part of the specific reserve from
the general reserve analysis. HP establishes a specific reserve for financing receivables with identified exposures, such as customer defaults, bankruptcy or other events, that make it unlikely HP
will recover its investment. For individually evaluated receivables, HP determines the expected cash flow for the receivable, which includes consideration of estimated proceeds from disposition of the
collateral, and calculates an estimate of the potential loss and the probability of loss. For those accounts where a loss is considered probable, HP records a specific reserve. HP generally writes off
a receivable or records a specific reserve when a receivable becomes 180 days past due, or sooner if HP determines that the receivable is not collectible.

Non-Accrual and Past-Due Financing Receivables

HP considers a financing receivable to be past due when the minimum payment is not received by the contractually specified due date. HP
generally places financing receivables on non-accrual status, which is suspension of interest accrual, and considers such receivables to be non-performing at the earlier of the time at which full
payment of principal and interest becomes doubtful or the receivable becomes 90 days past due. Subsequently, HP may recognize revenue on non-accrual financing receivables as payments are
received, which is on a cash basis, if HP deems the recorded financing receivable to be fully collectible; however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of the recorded financing
receivable, all cash receipts are applied to the carrying amount of the financing receivable, which is the cost recovery method. In certain circumstances, such as when HP deems a delinquency to be of
an administrative nature, financing receivables may accrue interest after becoming 90 days past due. The non-accrual status of a financing receivable may not impact a customer's risk rating.
After all of a customer's delinquent principal and interest balances are settled, HP may return the related financing receivable to accrual status.

Goodwill
is net of accumulated impairment losses of $14.5 billion. Of that amount, $8.0 billion relates to the ES segment,
$5.7 billion relates to Software, and the remaining $0.8 billion relates to Corporate Investments.

Effective
at the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2014, HP implemented certain organizational changes to align its segment financial
reporting more closely with its current business structure. As a result of these organizational realignments, HP transferred $126 million of goodwill related to the transfer of the Printing spare and
replacement parts business from the EG segment to the Printing segment, $48 million of goodwill related to the transfer of the Personal Systems spare and replacement parts business from the EG segment
to the Personal Systems segment, $42 million of goodwill related to the transfer of the Personal Systems trade and warranty support business from the EG segment to the Personal Systems segment and $22
million of goodwill related to the transfer of the HP Exstream business from the Printing segment to the Software segment. See Note 2 for a full description of the segment realignments.

Goodwill
relates to the MphasiS Limited reporting unit.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 9: Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Continued)

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level. At the beginning of its first quarter of fiscal 2014, HP made a change to its reporting units. In connection with continued
operational synergies and interdependencies between the Enterprise Servers, Storage and Networking reporting unit and the TS reporting unit within the EG segment, HP combined these reporting units to
create the EG reporting unit. As of October 31, 2014, HP's reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 2, except for ES, which includes two reporting
units: MphasiS Limited; and the remainder of ES.

Based
on the results of its annual impairment tests, HP determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of August 1, 2014. However, future goodwill impairment tests could
result in a charge to earnings. HP will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there
may be a potential impairment.

Goodwill impairments

There were no goodwill impairments in fiscal 2014 and 2013.

During
fiscal 2012, HP determined that sufficient indicators of potential impairment existed to require an interim goodwill impairment analysis for the ES reporting unit. These
indicators included the trading values of HP's stock at the time of the impairment test, coupled with market conditions and business trends within ES. The fair value of the ES reporting unit was based
on the income approach. The decline in the fair value of the ES reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the risk factor
that was included in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows. The increase in the discount rate was due to the implied control premium resulting from trading values of HP stock
at the time of the impairment test. The resulting adjustments to discount rates caused a significant reduction in the fair value for the ES reporting unit. Based on the step one and step two analyses,
HP recorded an $8.0 billion goodwill
impairment charge in fiscal 2012, and there was no remaining goodwill in the ES reporting unit as of October 31, 2012. Prior to completing the goodwill impairment test, HP tested the
recoverability of the ES long-lived assets (other than goodwill) and concluded that such assets were not impaired.

Also
during fiscal 2012, the Software segment included two reporting units, which were Autonomy and the legacy HP Software business. HP initiated its annual goodwill impairment analysis
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and concluded that fair value was below carrying amount for the Autonomy reporting unit. The fair value of the Autonomy reporting unit was based on the income
approach.

The
decline in the estimated fair value of the Autonomy reporting unit resulted from lower projected revenue growth rates and profitability levels as well as an increase in the risk
factor that was included in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows. The increase in the discount rate was due to the implied control premium that resulted from trading values of
HP stock at the time of the impairment test. The lower projected operating results reflected changes in assumptions related to organic revenue growth rates, market trends, business mix, cost
structure, expected deal synergies and other expectations about the anticipated short-term and long-term operating results of the Autonomy business. These assumptions incorporated HP's analysis of
what it believes were accounting improprieties, incomplete disclosures and misrepresentations at Autonomy that occurred prior to the Autonomy acquisition with respect to Autonomy's pre-acquisition
business and related operating results. In addition, as noted above, when estimating the fair value of a reporting unit HP may need to adjust



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 9: Acquisitions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets (Continued)

discount
rates and/or other assumptions in order to derive a reasonable implied control premium when comparing the sum of the fair values of HP's reporting units to HP's market capitalization. Due to
the trading values of HP stock at the time of the impairment test, the resulting adjustments to the discount rate to arrive at an appropriate control premium caused a significant reduction in the fair
value for the Autonomy reporting unit as well as the fair values for HP's other reporting units.

Prior
to conducting step one of the goodwill impairment test for the Autonomy reporting unit, HP first evaluated the recoverability of the long-lived assets, including intangible assets.
When indicators of impairment are present, HP tests long-lived assets (other than goodwill) for recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of an asset group to its undiscounted cash flows. HP
considered the lower-than-expected revenue and profitability levels over a sustained period of time, the trading values of HP stock and downward revisions to management's short- and long-term
forecasts for the Autonomy business to be indicators of impairment for the Autonomy long-lived assets. Based on the results of the recoverability test, HP determined that the carrying amount of the
Autonomy asset group exceeded its undiscounted cash flows and was therefore not recoverable. HP then compared the fair value of the asset group to its carrying amount and determined the impairment
loss. The impairment loss was allocated to the carrying values of the long-lived assets but not below their individual fair values. Based on the analysis, HP recorded an impairment charge of
$3.1 billion on intangible assets, which resulted in a remaining carrying amount of approximately $0.8 billion as of October 31, 2012. The decline in the fair
value of the Autonomy intangible assets was attributable to the same factors as discussed above for the fair value of the Autonomy reporting unit.

The
decline in the fair value of the Autonomy reporting unit and Autonomy intangibles, as well as fair value changes for other assets and liabilities in the step two goodwill impairment
test, resulted in an implied fair value of goodwill substantially below the carrying amount of the goodwill for the Autonomy reporting unit. As a result, HP recorded a goodwill impairment charge of
$5.7 billion, which resulted in a $1.2 billion remaining carrying amount of Autonomy goodwill as of October 31, 2012. Both the goodwill impairment charge and the intangible assets
impairment charge, totaling $8.8 billion, were included in the Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets line item in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Subsequent
to the Autonomy purchase price allocation period, which concluded in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, and in conjunction with HP's annual goodwill impairment testing, HP
identified certain indicators of impairment. The indicators of impairment included lower-than-expected revenue and profitability levels over a sustained period of time, the trading values of HP stock
and downward revisions to management's short- and long-term forecasts for the Autonomy business. HP revised its multi-year forecast for the Autonomy business, and the timing of this forecast revision
coincided with the timing of HP's overall forecasting process for all reporting units, which is completed each year in the fourth fiscal quarter in conjunction with the annual goodwill impairment
analysis. The change in assumptions used in the revised forecast and the fair value estimates utilized in the impairment testing of the Autonomy goodwill and long-lived assets incorporated insights
gained from having owned the Autonomy business for the preceding year. The revised forecast reflected changes related to organic revenue growth rates, current market trends, business mix, cost
structure, expected deal synergies and other expectations about the anticipated short- and long-term operating results of the Autonomy business, driven by HP's analysis regarding certain accounting
improprieties, incomplete disclosures and misrepresentations at Autonomy that occurred prior to the Autonomy acquisition with respect to Autonomy's pre-acquisition business and related operating
results. Accordingly, the change in fair values represented a change in accounting estimate that occurred outside the purchase price allocation period, resulting in the recorded impairment charge.

Based
on the results of the annual impairment test for all other reporting units, HP concluded that no other goodwill impairment existed as of August 1, 2012, apart from the
impairment charges discussed above.

For
fiscal 2014, $855 million of intangible assets became fully amortized and have been eliminated from gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization. HP also eliminated
gross intangible assets and accumulated amortization related to the sale of a portfolio of intellectual property ("IP") in the first quarter of fiscal 2014.

For
fiscal 2013, the majority of the decrease in gross intangible assets was related to $1.7 billion of fully amortized intangible assets that were eliminated from both the gross
and accumulated amounts.

In
fiscal 2012, HP recorded total intangible asset impairment charges of $4.3 billion, of which $3.1 billion was related to the Autonomy reporting unit as described above.
The remaining $1.2 billion was related to a change in the Compaq branding strategy. In May 2012, HP approved a change to its branding strategy for PCs, which has resulted in a more limited and
focused use of the "Compaq" trade name acquired in fiscal 2002. In conjunction with the change in branding strategy, HP revised its assumption as to the useful life of that intangible asset, which
resulted in a reclassification of the asset from an indefinite-lived intangible to a finite- lived intangible. These changes triggered an impairment review of the "Compaq" trade name intangible asset.
In conducting an impairment review of an intangible asset, HP compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying amount. If the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying amount, the
difference is recorded as an impairment loss. HP estimated the fair value of the "Compaq" trade name by calculating the present value of the royalties saved that would have been paid to a third party
had HP not owned the trade name. Following the completion of that analysis, HP determined that the fair value of the trade name asset was less than the carrying amount due primarily to the change in
the useful life assumption and a decrease in expected future revenues related to Compaq-branded products resulting from the more focused branding strategy. As a result, HP recorded an impairment
charge of $1.2 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2012, which was included in the Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets line item in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.

Note 10: Fair Value

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants at the
measurement date.

Fair Value Hierarchy

HP uses valuation techniques that are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are developed using market data
such as publicly available information and reflect the assumptions market participants would use, while unobservable inputs are developed using the best information available about the assumptions
market participants would use. Assets and liabilities are classified in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1—Quoted
prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2—Quoted
prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active,
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs.

Level 3—Unobservable
inputs for the asset or liability.

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to observable inputs and lowest priority to unobservable inputs.

For

Valuation Techniques

Cash Equivalents and Investments:    HP holds time deposits, money market funds, mutual funds, other debt securities
primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and bonds, and common stock and equivalents. HP values cash equivalents and equity investments using quoted market prices, alternative
pricing sources, including NAV, or models utilizing market observable inputs. The fair value of debt investments was based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using inputs primarily
derived from or corroborated by observable market data, and, in certain instances, valuation models that utilize assumptions which cannot be corroborated with observable market data.

Derivative
Instruments:    HP uses forward contracts, interest rate and total return swaps and option contracts to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
HP uses industry standard valuation models to measure fair value. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to present value using market-based
observable inputs, including interest rate curves, HP and counterparty credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and interest rates. See Note 11 for a
further discussion of HP's use of derivative instruments.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 10: Fair Value (Continued)

Other Fair Value Disclosures

Short- and Long-Term Debt:    HP estimates the fair value of its debt primarily using an expected present value technique,
which is based on observable market inputs using interest rates currently available to companies of similar credit standing for similar terms and remaining maturities, and considering its own credit
risk. The portion of HP's debt that is hedged is reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as an amount equal to the debt's carrying amount and a fair value adjustment representing changes in the
fair value of the hedged debt obligations arising from movements in benchmark interest rates. The estimated fair value of HP's short- and long-term debt was $19.9 billion at October 31,
2014, compared to its carrying amount of $19.5 billion at that date. The estimated fair value of HP's short- and long-term debt was $22.7 billion at October 31, 2013, compared to
its carrying amount of $22.6 billion at that date. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, short- and long-term debt would be classified in Level 2 of the fair
value hierarchy.

Other
Financial Instruments:    For the balance of HP's financial instruments, primarily accounts receivable, accounts payable and financial liabilities included in other
accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these other financial instruments would be
classified in Level 2 or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

Non-Marketable
Equity Investments and Non-Financial Assets:    HP's non-marketable equity investments and non-financial assets, such as intangible assets, goodwill and
property, plant and equipment, are recorded at fair value in the period an impairment charge is recognized. If measured at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, these would generally be
classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

In
fiscal 2012, HP recognized a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of $8.8 billion associated with the Autonomy reporting unit, a goodwill impairment charge of
$8.0 billion associated with the ES reporting unit, and an intangible asset impairment charge of $1.2 billion associated with the Compaq trade name. The fair value of these reporting
units was classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy due to the significance of unobservable inputs developed using company-specific information. HP used the income approach to measure
the fair value of the ES and Autonomy reporting units. Under the income approach, HP calculated the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Cash
flow projections were based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used was based on the
weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash
flows. The discount rate also reflected adjustments required when comparing the sum of the fair values of HP's reporting units to HP's market capitalization as discussed in Note 9. The
unobservable inputs used to estimate the fair value these reporting units included projected revenue growth rates, profitability and the risk factor added to the discount rate.

The
inputs used to estimate the fair value of the intangible assets of Autonomy and the "Compaq" trade name were largely unobservable, and, accordingly, these measurements were
classified in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the intangible assets for Autonomy were estimated using an income approach, which is based on management's cash flow
projections of revenue growth rates and operating margins, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. HP estimated the fair value of the "Compaq" trade name by calculating the present
value of the royalties saved that would

Note 10: Fair Value (Continued)

have
been paid to a third party had HP not owned the trade name. The discount rates used in the fair value calculations for the Autonomy intangibles and the "Compaq" trade name were based on a
weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with those assets. The unobservable inputs used in these valuations include projected revenue growth rates, operating
margins,
royalty rates and the risk factor added to the discount rate. The discount rates ranged from 11% to 16%. Projected revenue growth rates ranged from (61)% to 13%. The (61)% rate reflected the
significant decline in expected future revenues for Compaq-branded products from fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2014 due to the change in branding strategy discussed in Note 9.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 11: Financial Instruments (Continued)

All
highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. As of October 31, 2014 and
October 31, 2013, the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximated fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Interest income related to cash, cash equivalents and debt
securities was approximately $136 million in fiscal 2014, $148 million in fiscal 2013 and $155 million in fiscal 2012. Time deposits were primarily issued by institutions outside
the U.S. as of October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013. The estimated fair value of the available-for-sale investments may not be representative of values that will be realized in the
future.

The
gross unrealized loss as of October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013 was due primarily to decline in the fair value of a debt security of $14 million and
$15 million, respectively, that has been in a continuous loss position for more than twelve months. HP does not intend to sell this debt security, and it is not likely that HP will be required
to sell this debt security prior to the recovery of the amortized cost.

Contractual
maturities of investments in available-for-sale debt securities were as follows:

Equity
securities in privately held companies include cost basis and equity method investments and are included in Long-term financing receivables and other assets in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. These amounted to $97 million and $50 million at October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013, respectively.

Derivative Instruments

HP is a global company exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of its
business. As part of its risk management strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, option contracts, interest rate swaps and total return swaps, to hedge certain foreign
currency, interest rate and, to a lesser extent, equity exposures. HP's objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to
hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting the fair value of assets and liabilities. HP does not have any leveraged derivatives and does not use derivative contracts for
speculative purposes. HP may designate its derivative contracts as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation ("net
investment hedges"). Additionally, for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, HP categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. HP recognizes all derivative instruments at fair
value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. HP classifies cash flows from its derivative programs as operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

As
a result of its use of derivative instruments, HP is exposed to the risk that its counterparties will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate counterparty credit risk,
HP has a policy of only entering into derivative contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based on their



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 11: Financial Instruments (Continued)

credit
ratings and other factors, and HP maintains dollar risk limits that correspond to each financial institution's credit rating and other factors. HP's established policies and procedures for
mitigating credit risk include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and periodically re-assessing the creditworthiness of its counterparties. Master netting agreements further
mitigate credit exposure to counterparties by permitting HP to net amounts due from HP to counterparty against amounts due to HP from the same counterparty under certain conditions.

To
further mitigate credit exposure to counterparties, HP has collateral security agreements that allow HP to hold collateral from, or require HP to post collateral to, counterparties
when aggregate derivative fair values exceed contractually established thresholds which are generally based on the credit ratings of HP and its counterparties. If HP's or the counterparty's credit
rating falls below a specified credit rating, either party has the right to request full collateralization of the derivatives' net liability position. Collateral is generally posted within two
business days. The fair value of derivatives with credit contingent features in a net liability position was $38 million and $207 million at October 31, 2014 and
October 31, 2013, respectively, all of which were fully collateralized within two business days.

Under
HP's derivative contracts, the counterparty can terminate all outstanding trades following a covered change of control event affecting HP that results in the surviving entity being
rated below a specified credit rating. This credit contingent provision did not affect HP's financial position or cash flows as of October 31, 2014 and October 31, 2013.

Fair Value Hedges

HP issues long-term debt in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. HP may enter into fair value hedges, such
as interest rate swaps, to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving a primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating
interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, HP may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest
payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial.

When
investing in fixed-rate instruments, HP may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest payments into variable interest payments and may designate these swaps as
fair value hedges.

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, HP recognizes the change in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in
the fair value of the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.

Cash Flow Hedges

HP uses a combination of forward contracts and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency
exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expenses, and intercompany loans denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. HP's
foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within twelve months; however, hedges related to longer term procurement arrangements extend several years and forward contracts associated with
sales-type and direct-financing leases and intercompany loans extend for the duration of the lease or loan term, which typically range from two to five years.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 11: Financial Instruments (Continued)

For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, HP initially records changes in fair value for the effective portion of the derivative instrument in
Accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during
which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. HP reports the effective portion of its cash flow hedges in the same financial statement line item as changes in the fair value of the hedged
item.

Net Investment Hedges

HP uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is the local currency. HP records the effective portion of such derivative instruments together with changes in the fair value of the hedged items in Cumulative translation adjustment as a
separate component of stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Other Derivatives

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign
currency-denominated balance sheet exposures. HP also uses total return swaps and, to a lesser extent, interest rate swaps, based on equity or fixed income indices, to hedge its executive deferred
compensation plan liability.

For
derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, HP recognizes changes in fair value of the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting change in the fair value of
the hedged item, in Interest and other net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period of change.

Hedge Effectiveness

For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the
hedged instrument with the change in fair value of the derivative. For foreign currency options and forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness
by comparing the cumulative change in fair value of the hedge contract with the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. HP recognizes any
ineffective portion of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the same period in which ineffectiveness occurs. Amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in
the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period they arise.

or net investment hedges. As of October 31, 2012 the portion of the hedging instruments' gain or loss excluded from the assessment of effectiveness was not material for fair value, cash flow or
net investment hedges. Hedge ineffectiveness for fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges was not material for fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012.

As
of October 31, 2014, HP expects to reclassify an estimated net Accumulated other comprehensive gain of approximately $185 million, net of taxes, to earnings in the next
twelve months along with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions associated with cash flow hedges.

The
pre-tax effect of derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings for fiscal years ended October 31, 2014, 2013 and

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 12: Borrowings (Continued)

As disclosed in Note 11, HP uses interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure of its debt portfolio to changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates by achieving
a primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense. Interest rates shown in the table of long-term debt have not been adjusted to reflect the impact of any interest rate swaps.

In
May 2012, HP filed a shelf registration statement (the "2012 Shelf Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to enable the company to offer for
sale, from time to time, in one or more offerings, an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants.

HP's
Board of Directors has authorized the issuance of up to $16.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper by HP. HP's subsidiaries are authorized to issue up to
an additional $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of commercial paper. HP maintains two commercial paper programs, and a wholly-owned subsidiary maintains a third program. HP's U.S.
program provides for the issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion. HP's euro commercial paper program provides for the
issuance of commercial paper outside of the U.S. denominated in U.S. dollars, euros or British pounds up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion or the equivalent in those
alternative currencies. The combined aggregate principal amount of commercial paper outstanding under those programs at any one time cannot exceed the $16.0 billion authorized by HP's Board of
Directors. The HP subsidiary's Euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Programme provides for the issuance of commercial paper in various currencies of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount
of $500 million.

HP
maintains senior unsecured committed credit facilities primarily to support the issuance of commercial paper. HP has a $3.0 billion five-year credit facility that expires in
March 2017 and a $4.5 billion five-year credit facility that expires in April 2019. The $4.5 billion credit facility expiring in April 2019 was executed in the second quarter of fiscal
2014 and replaced a previous $4.5 billion credit facility that was to expire in February 2015. Both facilities support the U.S. commercial paper program and the euro commercial paper program.
Commitment fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit facilities vary based on HP's external credit ratings. HP's ability to have an outstanding U.S. commercial paper balance
that exceeds the $7.5 billion supported by these credit facilities is subject to a number of factors, including liquidity conditions and business performance. In addition, the
$3.0 billion five-year credit facility was amended in September 2012 to permit borrowings in euros and British pounds, with the amounts available in euros and British pounds being limited to
the U.S. dollar equivalent of $2.2 billion and $300 million, respectively.

Note 14: Net Earnings Per Share

HP calculates basic net EPS using net earnings (loss) and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted net EPS includes any dilutive effect of
restricted stock awards, stock options, performance-based awards and shares purchased under the 2011 ESPP.

The
reconciliations of the numerators and denominators of each of the basic and diluted net EPS calculations were as follows:

earnings allocated to participating securities were not significant in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012. HP considers restricted stock awards

For
fiscal 2012, HP excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share 10 million shares potentially issuable under
stock-based incentive compensation plans and the 2011 ESPP, as their effect, if included, would have been anti-dilutive.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 14: Net Earnings Per Share (Continued)

(3)

HP
excludes options where the assumed proceeds exceed the average market price from the calculation of diluted net EPS, because their effect
would be anti-dilutive. The assumed proceeds of an option include the sum of its exercise price, average unrecognized compensation cost and excess tax benefits.

Note 15: Litigation and Contingencies

HP is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of IP, commercial, securities, employment, employee benefits and
environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP accrues a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss
can be reasonably estimated. HP believes it has recorded adequate provisions for any such matters and, as of October 31, 2014, it was not reasonably possible that a material loss had been
incurred in excess of the amounts recognized in HP's financial statements. HP reviews these matters at least quarterly and adjusts its accruals to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,
rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Based on its experience, HP believes that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters
discussed below are not a meaningful indicator of HP's potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, HP believes it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending
against it. Nevertheless, cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of these contingencies.

Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations

Copyright Levies

.

As described below, proceedings are ongoing or have been concluded involving HP in certain European
Union ("EU") member countries, including litigation in Germany, Belgium and
Austria, seeking to impose or modify levies upon equipment (such as multi-function devices ("MFDs"), personal computers ("PCs") and printers) and alleging that these devices enable producing private
copies of copyrighted materials. Descriptions of some of the ongoing proceedings are included below. The levies are generally based upon the number of products sold and the per-product amounts of the
levies, which vary. Some EU member countries that do not yet have levies on digital devices are expected to implement similar legislation to enable them to extend existing levy schemes, while some
other EU member countries have phased out levies or are expected to limit the scope of levy schemes and applicability in the digital hardware environment, particularly with respect to sales to
business users. HP, other companies and various industry associations have opposed the extension of levies to the digital environment and have advocated alternative models of compensation to rights
holders.

VerwertungsGesellschaft
Wort ("VG Wort"), a collection agency representing certain copyright holders, instituted legal proceedings against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court seeking to
impose levies on printers. On December 22, 2004, the court held that HP is liable for payments regarding all printers using ASCII code sold in Germany but did not determine the amount payable
per unit. HP appealed this decision in January 2005 to the Stuttgart Court of Appeals. On May 11, 2005, the Stuttgart Court of Appeals issued a decision confirming that levies are due. On
June 6, 2005, HP filed an appeal to the German Federal Supreme Court in Karlsruhe. On December 6, 2007, the German Federal Supreme Court issued a judgment that printers are not subject
to levies under existing law. VG Wort appealed the decision by filing a claim with the German Federal Constitutional Court challenging the ruling that printers are not subject to levies. On
September 21, 2010, the Constitutional Court published a decision holding that the German Federal Supreme Court erred by not referring questions on interpretation of German copyright law to the
Court of Justice of the European Union ("CJEU") and therefore revoked



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 15: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

the
German Federal Supreme Court decision and remitted the matter to it. On July 21, 2011, the German Federal Supreme Court stayed the proceedings and referred several questions to the CJEU
with regard to the interpretation of the European Copyright Directive. On June 27, 2013, the CJEU issued its decision responding to those questions. The German Federal Supreme Court
subsequently scheduled a joint hearing on this matter with other cases relating to reprographic levies on printers and PCs that was held on October 31, 2013. The German Federal Supreme Court
issued a decision on July 3, 2014 partially granting the claim of VG Wort. The German Federal Supreme Court decision provides that levies are due where the printer is used with a PC to make
permitted reprographic copies in a single process under the control of the same person, but no levies are due on a printer for reprographic copies made with a "scanner-PC-printer" product chain. The
case has been remitted to lower courts to assess the amount to be paid per printer unit.

In
September 2003, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against Fujitsu Technology Solutions GmbH ("Fujitsu") in the Munich Civil Court in Munich, Germany seeking to impose levies on PCs. This
is an industry test case in Germany, and HP has agreed not to object to the delay if VG Wort sues HP for such levies on PCs following a final decision against Fujitsu. On December 23, 2004, the
Munich Civil Court held that PCs are subject to a levy and that Fujitsu must pay €12 plus compound interest for each PC sold in Germany since March 2001. Fujitsu appealed this decision
in January 2005 to the
Munich Court of Appeals. On December 15, 2005, the Munich Court of Appeals affirmed the Munich Civil Court decision. Fujitsu filed an appeal with the German Federal Supreme Court in February
2006. On October 2, 2008, the German Federal Supreme Court issued a judgment that PCs were not photocopiers within the meaning of the German copyright law that was in effect until
December 31, 2007 and, therefore, were not subject to the levies on photocopiers established by that law. VG Wort subsequently filed a claim with the German Federal Constitutional Court
challenging that ruling. In January 2011, the Constitutional Court published a decision holding that the German Federal Supreme Court decision was inconsistent with the German Constitution and
revoking the German Federal Supreme Court decision. The Constitutional Court also remitted the matter to the German Federal Supreme Court for further action. On July 21, 2011, the German
Federal Supreme Court stayed the proceedings and referred several questions to the CJEU with regard to the interpretation of the European Copyright Directive. On June 27, 2013, the CJEU issued
its decision responding to those questions. The German Federal Supreme Court subsequently scheduled a joint hearing on that matter with other cases relating to reprographic levies on printers that was
held on October 31, 2013. The German Federal Supreme Court issued a decision on July 3, 2014 partially granting the claim of VG Wort. The German Federal Supreme Court decision provides
that levies are due for audio-visual copying of standing text and pictures using a PC as the last device in a single reproduction process under the control of the same person, but no levies are due on
a PC for reprographic copies made using a "PC-printer" or a "scanner-PC-printer" chain. The case has been remitted to lower courts to assess the amount to be paid per PC unit.

Reprobel,
a cooperative society with the authority to collect and distribute the remuneration for reprography to Belgian copyright holders, requested by extra-judicial means that HP
amend certain copyright levy declarations submitted for inkjet MFDs sold in Belgium from January 2005 to December 2009 to enable it to collect copyright levies calculated based on the generally higher
copying speed when the MFDs are operated in draft print mode rather than when operated in normal print mode. In March 2010, HP filed a lawsuit against Reprobel in the French-speaking chambers of the
Court of First Instance of Brussels seeking a declaratory judgment that no copyright levies are payable on sales of MFDs in Belgium or, alternatively, that copyright levies payable on such MFDs must
be assessed based



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 15: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

on
the copying speed when operated in the normal print mode set by default in the device. On November 16, 2012, the court issued a decision holding that Belgium law is not in conformity with EU
law in a number of respects and ordered that, by November 2013, Reprobel substantiate that the amounts claimed by Reprobel are commensurate with the harm resulting from legitimate copying under the
reprographic exception. HP subsequently appealed that court decision to the Courts of Appeal in Brussels seeking to confirm that the Belgian law is not in conformity with EU law and that, if Belgian
law is interpreted in a manner consistent with EU law, no payments by HP are required or, alternatively, the payments already made by HP are sufficient to comply with its obligations under Belgian
law. On October 23, 2013, the Court of Appeal in Brussels stayed the proceedings and referred several questions to the CJEU relating to whether the Belgian reprographic copyright levies system
is in conformity with EU law.

Based
on industry opposition to the extension of levies to digital products, HP's assessments of the merits of various proceedings and HP's estimates of the number of units impacted and
the amounts of the levies, HP has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the matters described above. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters and the associated financial
impact on HP, including the number of units impacted and the amount of levies imposed, remains uncertain.

Fair Labor Standards Act Litigation

.

HP is involved in several lawsuits in which the plaintiffs are seeking unpaid
overtime compensation and other damages based on allegations that various employees of Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") or HP have been misclassified as exempt employees under the Fair
Labor Standards Act and/or in violation of the California Labor Code or other state laws. Those matters include the following:

•

Cunningham and Cunningham, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

is a purported collective action filed on May 10, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York claiming that
current and former EDS employees allegedly involved in installing and/or maintaining computer software and hardware were misclassified as exempt employees. Another purported collective action,

Steavens, et al. v. Electronic
Data Systems Corporation

, was filed on October 23, 2007 in the same court alleging
similar facts. The

Steavens

case has been consolidated for pretrial purposes with the

Cunningham

case. On December 14, 2010, the court
granted conditional certification of a class consisting of
employees in 20 legacy EDS job codes in the consolidated

Cunningham

and

Steavens

matter. On December 11, 2013, HP and plaintiffs'
counsel in the consolidated

Cunningham/Steavens

matter, and the

Salva

matter described below, mediated these cases and reached a
settlement agreement. The court preliminarily approved the settlement on November 4, 2014. The final approval hearing is scheduled for June 8, 2015.

•

Salva v. Hewlett-Packard Company

is a
purported collective action filed on June 15, 2012 in the United States District Court for the Western District of New York alleging that certain information technology employees allegedly
involved in installing and/or maintaining computer software and hardware were misclassified as exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act. On December 11, 2013, HP and plaintiffs'
counsel in the consolidated

Cunningham/Steavens

matter and the

Salva

matter mediated these cases and
reached a settlement agreement. The court consolidated the

Salva

matter into the

Cunningham/Steavens

matter and preliminarily approved the settlement on November 4, 2014. The final approval hearing is scheduled for June 8, 2015.

•

Karlbom, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

is a class action filed on March 16, 2009 in California Superior Court alleging facts similar to the

Cunningham

and

Steavens

matters. The parties are currently engaged in discovery.

•

Blake, et al. v. Hewlett-Packard Company

was
filed as a purported nationwide collective action on February 17, 2011 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas claiming that a class of information technology
support personnel had been misclassified as exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act. On February 10, 2012, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that the court conditionally
certify the case as a collective action. On July 11, 2013, the court denied the plaintiffs' motion for conditional certification in its entirety. Following the denial of class certification,
the case has continued as an individual action on behalf of the named plaintiff and one other employee. The parties have reached an agreement to resolve this matter with the two plaintiffs agreeing to
settle their individual claims and release any other claims they may have against HP. The court approved the settlement on August 19, 2014, and dismissed the case with prejudice on
September 9, 2014.

•

Benedict v. Hewlett-Packard Company

is a
purported collective action filed on January 10, 2013 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California alleging that certain technical support employees allegedly
involved in installing, maintaining and/or supporting computer software and/or hardware for HP were misclassified as exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act. The plaintiff has also alleged
that HP violated California law by, among other things, allegedly improperly classifying these employees as exempt. On February 13, 2014, the court granted the plaintiff's motion for
conditional class certification. The parties are engaged in discovery.

State of South Carolina Department of Social Services Contract Dispute

.

In October 2012, the State of South Carolina
Department of Social Services and related government agencies ("SCDSS") filed a proceeding before South Carolina's Chief Procurement Officer ("CPO") against Hewlett-Packard State & Local
Enterprise Services, Inc., a subsidiary of HP ("HPSLES"). The dispute arises from a contract between SCDSS and HPSLES for the design, implementation and maintenance of a Child Support
Enforcement and a Family Court Case Management System (the "CFS System"). SCDSS seeks aggregate damages of approximately $275 million, a declaration that HPSLES is in material breach of the
contract and, therefore, that termination of the contract for cause by SCDSS would be appropriate, and a declaration that HPSLES is required to perform certain additional disputed work that expands
the scope of the original contract. In November 2012, HPSLES filed responsive pleadings asserting defenses and seeking payment of past-due invoices totaling more than $12 million. On
July 10, 2013, SCDSS terminated the contract with HPSLES for cause, and, in its termination notice, SCDSS asserted that HPSLES is responsible for all future federal penalties until the CFS
System achieves federal certification, sought an immediate order requiring HPSLES to transfer to SCDSS all work completed and in progress, and indicated that it intends to seek suspension and
debarment of HPSLES from
contracting with the State of South Carolina. HPSLES is disputing the termination as improper and defective. In addition, on August 9, 2013, HPSLES filed its own affirmative claim within the
proceeding alleging that SCDSS materially breached the contract by its improper termination and that SCDSS was a primary and material cause of the project delays. On September 4, 2013, the CPO
denied SCDSS's motion for injunctive relief seeking immediate transfer of the system assets to SCDSS and indicated that the CPO would address that request following a hearing on the merits. The
hearing on the merits before the CPO concluded on February 25, 2014 and closing briefs were submitted on July 18, 2014.

India Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Proceedings

.

On April 30 and May 10, 2010, the India Directorate
of Revenue Intelligence (the "DRI") issued show cause notices to Hewlett-Packard India Sales Private Ltd ("HPI"), a subsidiary of HP, seven then-current HP employees and one former HP employee
alleging that HP underpaid customs duties while importing products and spare parts into India and seeking to recover an aggregate of approximately $370 million, plus penalties. Prior to the
issuance of the show cause notices, HP deposited approximately $16 million with the DRI and agreed to post a provisional bond in exchange for the DRI's agreement to not seize HP products and
spare parts and to not interrupt the transaction of business by HP in India.

On
April 11, 2012, the Bangalore Commissioner of Customs issued an order on the products-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HPI and the named
individuals of approximately $386 million, of which HPI had already deposited $9 million. On December 11, 2012, HPI voluntarily deposited an additional $10 million in
connection with the products-related show cause notice.

On
April 20, 2012, the Commissioner issued an order on the parts-related show cause notice affirming certain duties and penalties against HPI and certain of the named individuals
of approximately $17 million, of which HPI had already deposited $7 million. After the order, HPI deposited an additional $3 million in connection with the parts-related show
cause notice so as to avoid certain penalties.

HPI
filed appeals of the Commissioner's orders before the Customs Tribunal along with applications for waiver of the pre-deposit of remaining demand amounts as a condition for hearing
the appeals. The Customs Department has also filed cross-appeals before the Customs Tribunal. On January 24, 2013, the Customs Tribunal ordered HPI to deposit an additional $24 million
against the products order, which HPI deposited in March 2013. The Customs Tribunal did not order any additional deposit to be made under the parts order. In December 2013, HPI filed applications
before the Customs Tribunal seeking early hearing of the appeals as well as an extension of the stay of deposit as to HP and the individuals already granted until final disposition of the appeals. On
February 7, 2014, the application for extension of the stay of deposit was granted by the Customs Tribunal until disposal of the appeals. On October 27, 2014, the Customs Tribunal
commenced hearings on the cross-appeals of the Commissioner's orders. The Customs Tribunal rejected HP's request to remand the matter to the Commissioner on procedural grounds, and is scheduled to
reconvene hearings on the merits beginning on April 6, 2015.

Russia GPO and Other FCPA Investigations

.

The German Public Prosecutor's Office ("German PPO") has been
conducting an investigation into allegations that current and former employees of HP engaged in bribery, embezzlement and tax evasion relating to a transaction between Hewlett-Packard ISE GmbH
in Germany, a former subsidiary of HP, and the General Prosecutor's Office of the Russian Federation. The approximately €35 million transaction, which was referred to as the
Russia GPO deal, spanned the years 2001 to 2006 and was for the delivery and installation of an IT network. The



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 15: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

German
PPO has issued an indictment of four individuals, including one current and two former HP employees, on charges including bribery, breach of trust and tax evasion. The German PPO has also
requested that HP be made an associated party to the case, and, if that request is granted, HP would participate in any portion of the court proceedings that could ultimately bear on the question of
whether HP should be subject to potential disgorgement of profits based on the conduct of the indicted current and former employees. The Polish Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is also conducting an
investigation into potential corruption violations by an employee of Hewlett-Packard Polska Sp. z o.o., an indirect subsidiary of HP, in connection with certain public-sector transactions in Poland.
HP is cooperating with these investigating agencies.

The
DOJ and the SEC also conducted an investigation into the Russia GPO deal and potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act ("FCPA"). In addition, the same U.S.
enforcement agencies conducted investigations into certain other public-sector transactions in Russia, Poland, the Commonwealth of Independent States and Mexico, among other countries. On
April 9, 2014, HP announced a resolution of the DOJ and SEC FCPA investigations. Pursuant to the terms of the resolution of the DOJ and SEC FCPA investigation announced in April 2014, on
September 11, 2014, an HP subsidiary in Russia, ZAO Hewlett Packard A.O., entered a guilty plea in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, to criminal violations of
the FCPA. HP paid the SEC approximately $31 million, and paid approximately $77 million in fines and penalties pursuant to its
agreements with the DOJ. HP also has agreed to undertake certain compliance, reporting and cooperation obligations.

On
December 2, 2014, plaintiffs Petroleos Mexicanos and Pemex Exploracion filed a complaint against HP and HP Mexico in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of California alleging violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO Act), fraudulent concealment, tortious interference, and violations of the California Unfair
Competition Law in connection with alleged improper payments provided to Pemex officials by third-parties retained by HP Mexico. These allegations arise from the same subject-matter as a previously
disclosed 2014 Non-Prosecution Agreement between HP Mexico and the DOJ and a simultaneous cease-and-desist order against HP issued by the SEC. HP is investigating this claim, however, HP does not
believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material impact on its financial statements.

ECT Proceedings

.

In January 2011, the postal service of Brazil, Empresa Brasileira de Correios e
Telégrafos ("ECT"), notified an HP subsidiary in Brazil ("HP Brazil") that it had initiated administrative proceedings to consider whether to suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and
contract with ECT related to alleged improprieties in the bidding and contracting processes whereby employees of HP Brazil and employees of several other companies allegedly coordinated their bids and
fixed results for three ECT contracts in 2007 and 2008. In late July 2011, ECT notified HP Brazil it had decided to apply the penalties against HP Brazil and suspend HP Brazil's right to bid and
contract with ECT for five years, based upon the evidence before it. In August 2011, HP Brazil appealed ECT's decision. In April 2013, ECT rejected HP Brazil's appeal, and the administrative
proceedings were closed with the penalties against HP Brazil remaining in place. In parallel, in September 2011, HP Brazil filed a civil action against ECT seeking to have ECT's decision revoked. HP
Brazil also requested an injunction suspending the application of the penalties until a final ruling on the merits of the case. The court of first instance has not issued a decision on the merits of
the case, but it has denied HP Brazil's request for injunctive relief. HP Brazil appealed the denial of its request for injunctive relief to the intermediate appellate court, which issued a
preliminary ruling denying the request for injunctive relief

but
reducing the length of the sanctions from five to two years. HP Brazil appealed that decision and, in December 2011, obtained a ruling staying enforcement of ECT's sanctions until a final ruling
on the merits of the case. HP expects this decision to be issued in 2015 and any subsequent appeal on the merits to last several years.

Autonomy-Related Legal Matters

Investigations

.

As a result of the findings of an ongoing investigation, HP has provided information to the U.K. Serious
Fraud Office, the DOJ and the SEC related to the accounting improprieties, disclosure failures and misrepresentations at Autonomy that occurred prior to and in connection with HP's acquisition of
Autonomy. On November 21, 2012, representatives of the U.S. Department of Justice advised HP that they had opened an investigation relating to Autonomy. On February 6, 2013,
representatives of the U.K. Serious Fraud Office advised HP that they had also opened an investigation relating to Autonomy. HP is cooperating with the three investigating agencies.

Litigation

.

As described below, HP is involved in various stockholder litigation relating to, among other things, its
November 20, 2012 announcement that it recorded a non-cash charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets within its Software segment of approximately $8.8 billion in the
fourth quarter of its 2012 fiscal year and HP's statements that, based on HP's findings from an ongoing investigation, the majority of this impairment charge related to accounting improprieties,
misrepresentations to the market and disclosure failures at Autonomy that occurred prior to and in connection with HP's acquisition of Autonomy and the impact of those improprieties, failures and
misrepresentations on the expected future financial performance of the Autonomy business over the long term. This stockholder litigation was commenced against, among others, certain current and former
HP executive officers, certain current and former members of HP's Board of Directors, and
certain advisors to HP. The plaintiffs in these litigation matters are seeking to recover certain compensation paid by HP to the defendants and/or other damages. These matters include the

Environmental

HP's operations and products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental
protection, including laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content
of HP's products and the recycling, treatment and disposal of those products. In particular, HP faces increasing complexity in its product design and procurement operations as it adjusts to new and
future requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of its products, their safe use, and the energy consumption associated with those products, including requirements relating to
climate change. HP is also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for
specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). HP could incur substantial costs, its products
could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if its products become non-compliant with
environmental laws. HP's potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims and clean-up costs. The amount and timing of costs to
comply with environmental laws are difficult to predict.

HP
is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
("CERCLA"), known as "Superfund," or state laws similar to CERCLA, and may become a party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by private parties for contribution towards clean-up costs.
HP is also conducting environmental investigations or remediations at several current or former operating sites pursuant to administrative orders or consent agreements with state environmental
agencies.

Note 16: Guarantees

Guarantees

In the ordinary course of business, HP may issue performance guarantees to certain of its clients, customers and other parties pursuant
to which HP has guaranteed the performance obligations of third parties. Some of those guarantees may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, HP would be obligated to
perform over the term of the guarantee in the event a specified triggering event occurs as defined by the guarantee. HP believes the likelihood of having to perform under a material guarantee is
remote.

HP
has entered into service contracts with certain of its clients that are supported by financing arrangements. If a service contract is terminated as a result of HP's non-performance
under the contract or failure to comply with the terms of the financing arrangement, HP could, under certain circumstances, be required to acquire certain assets related to the service contract. HP
believes the likelihood of having to acquire a material amount of assets under these arrangements is remote.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify a third party to such

they
perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past performance. HP
also provides indemnifications to certain vendors and customers against claims of IP infringement made by third parties arising from the vendor's and customer's use of HP's software products and
services and certain other matters. Some indemnifications may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.

Warranty

HP accrues the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. HP engages in extensive product quality programs
and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, contractual warranty terms, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call,
current period product shipments and ongoing product failure rates, as well as specific product class failures outside of HP's baseline experience, affect the estimated warranty obligation.

HP's
aggregate product warranty liabilities and changes during the fiscal years were as follows:

and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and (ii) is accumulated and communicated to HP's management, including our principal executive officer and principal
financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of any changes

quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that there has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting during
that quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
