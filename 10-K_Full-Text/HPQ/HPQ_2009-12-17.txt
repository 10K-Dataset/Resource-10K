PART I

ITEM 1.    Business.

HP is a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and
medium-sized businesses ("SMBs") and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. Our offerings span:

•

multi-vendor customer services, including infrastructure technology and business process outsourcing, technology support
and maintenance, application development and support services and consulting and integration services;

•

enterprise information technology infrastructure, including enterprise storage and server technology, networking products
and resources, and software that optimizes business technology investments;

•

personal computing and other access devices; and

•

imaging and printing-related products and services.

HP
was incorporated in 1947 under the laws of the State of California as the successor to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard. Effective in May 1998, we
changed our state of incorporation from California to Delaware.

HP Products and Services; Segment Information

During fiscal 2009, our operations were organized into seven business segments: Services, Enterprise Storage and Servers ("ESS"), HP
Software, the Personal Systems Group ("PSG"), the Imaging and Printing Group ("IPG"), HP Financial Services ("HPFS"), and Corporate Investments.



Services,
ESS and HP Software are reported collectively as a broader HP Enterprise Business (formerly the Technology Solutions Group). While the HP Enterprise Business is not an operating segment, we
sometimes provide financial data aggregating the segments within it in order to provide a supplementary view of our business. In each of the past three fiscal years, notebooks, desktops and printing
supplies each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue. In fiscal 2009, infrastructure technology outsourcing also accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue, and
in fiscal 2007 industry standard servers also accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue.

A
summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our segments and business units is found in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. A discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

HP Enterprise Business

The HP Enterprise Business provides servers, storage, software and information technology ("IT") services that enable enterprise and
midmarket business customers to better manage their current IT environments and transform IT into a business enabler. HP Enterprise Business products and services help accelerate growth, minimize risk
and reduce costs to optimize the business value of customers' IT investments. Companies around the globe leverage HP's infrastructure solutions to deploy next generation data centers and address
business challenges ranging from
compliance to business continuity. The HP Enterprise Business's modular IT systems and services are primarily standards-based and feature differentiated technologies in areas including power and
cooling, unified management, security, virtualization and automation. Each of the three financial reporting segments within the HP Enterprise Business are described in detail below.

Services

Services, formerly HP Services, was renamed after the reorganization of the business units subsequent to the acquisition of Electronic
Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") in August 2008. Services provides consulting, outsourcing and technology services across infrastructure, applications and business process domains. Services delivers
to its clients by leveraging investments in consulting and support professionals, infrastructure technology, applications, standardized methodologies, and global supply and delivery. It is divided
into four main business units: infrastructure technology outsourcing, applications services, business process outsourcing and technology services.

Infrastructure Technology Outsourcing.

Infrastructure technology outsourcing delivers comprehensive services that streamline and
optimize our
clients' infrastructure to efficiently enhance performance, reduce costs, mitigate risk and enable business change. These services encompass the data center and the workplace (desktop); network and
communications; and security, compliance and business continuity. We also offer a set of managed services, providing a cross-section of our broader infrastructure services for smaller discrete
engagements.

Application Services.

Applications services help clients revitalize and manage their applications assets through flexible,
project-based, consulting
services and longer-term outsourcing contracts. These full lifecycle services encompass application development, testing, modernization, system integration, maintenance and management.
Applications projects open doors to new infrastructure technology outsourcing and business process outsourcing opportunities and represent attractive cross-selling opportunities to current HP clients.

Business Process Outsourcing.

Business process outsourcing is powered by a platform of underlying infrastructure technology,
applications and
standardized methodologies and is supplemented by IT



experience
and in-depth, industry-specific knowledge. These services encompass both industry-specific and cross-industry solutions. Our cross-industry solutions include a broad array of
enterprise shared services, customer relationship management services, financial process management services and administrative services.

Technology Services.

HP provides consulting and support services, as well as warranty support across HP's product lines. HP specializes
in keeping
technology running with mission critical services, converged infrastructure services, networking services, data center transformation services and infrastructure services for storage, server and
unified communication environments. HP's technology services offerings are available in the form of service contracts, pre-packaged offerings (HP Care Pack services) or on an individual
basis.

Enterprise Storage and Servers

The server market continues to shift towards standards-based architectures as proprietary hardware and operating systems are replaced
by industry standard server platforms that typically offer compelling price and performance advantages by leveraging standards-based operating systems and microprocessor designs. At the same time,
critical business functions continue to demand scalability and reliability. By providing a broad portfolio of storage and server solutions, ESS aims to optimize the combined product solutions required
by different customers and provide solutions for a wide range of operating environments, spanning both the enterprise and the SMB markets. ESS provides storage and server products in a number of
categories.

Industry Standard Servers.

Industry standard servers include primarily entry-level and mid-range ProLiant servers, which run primarily
Windows®,

(1)

Linux and Novell operating systems and leverage Intel Corporation ("Intel") and Advanced Micro Devices ("AMD") processors. The business spans a range of product
lines that include pedestal-tower servers, density-optimized rack servers and HP's BladeSystem family of server blades. In fiscal 2009, HP's industry standard server business continued to lead the
industry in terms of units shipped and factory revenue. HP also has a leadership position in server blades, the fastest growing segment of the market.

Business Critical Systems.

Business critical systems include Itanium®

(2)

-based Integrity servers running on the
HP-UX, Windows®, Linux, OpenVMS and NonStop operating systems, including the high-end Superdome servers and fault-tolerant Integrity NonStop servers. Business
critical systems also include the Reduced Instruction Set Computing ("RISC")-based servers with the HP 9000 line running on the HP-UX operating system, HP AlphaServers running on both
Tru64 UNIX®

(3)

and OpenVMS, and MIPs-based NonStop servers. During 2009, we continued to transition all business critical systems platforms to Itanium-based
servers.

HP Software

HP Software is a leading provider of enterprise and service-provider software and services. Our portfolio consists of:

Enterprise IT management software.

Enterprise IT management solutions, including support and professional services, allow customers to
manage IT
infrastructure, operations, applications, IT services,



and
business processes. These solutions also include tools to automate data center operations and IT processes. We market them as the HP business technology optimization suite, and we deliver them in
the form of traditional software licenses and, in some cases, via a software-as-a-service distribution model.

Information management and business intelligence solutions.

Our information management and business intelligence solutions include
information data
strategy, enterprise data warehousing, data integration, data protection, archiving, compliance, e-discovery and records management products. These solutions enable businesses to extract
more value from their structured and unstructured information.

Communications and media solutions.

Our communications and media industry solutions address the creation, delivery and management of
consumer and
enterprise communications services, with offerings in service delivery infrastructure and applications, real-time business support systems, next-generation operations support
systems and digital media. These solutions enable operators, media companies, and network equipment providers to drive incremental revenue, enable new business models and reduce infrastructure costs.

Personal Systems Group

PSG is the leading provider of personal computers ("PCs") in the world based on unit volume shipped and annual revenue. PSG provides
commercial PCs, consumer PCs, workstations, handheld computing devices, calculators and other related accessories, software and services for the commercial and consumer markets. We group commercial
desktops, commercial notebooks and workstations into commercial clients and consumer desktop and consumer notebooks into consumer clients when describing our performance in these markets. Like the
broader PC market, PSG continues to experience a shift toward mobile products such as notebooks. Both commercial and consumer PCs are based predominately on the Windows® operating system
and use Intel and AMD processors.

Commercial PCs.

PSG offers a variety of personal computers optimized for commercial uses, including enterprise and SMB customers, and
for
connectivity and manageability in networked environments. These commercial PCs include primarily the HP Compaq business desktops, notebooks, tablet PCs, mini notebooks and mobile workstations, as well
as the thin clients, retail point of sale systems, displays and the new TouchSmart all-in-one PC for business.

Consumer PCs.

Consumer PCs include the HP and Compaq series of multi-media consumer desktops, notebooks and mini notebooks, including
the TouchSmart
line of touch-enabled all-in-one desktops and notebooks.

Workstations.

Workstations are individual computing products designed for users demanding enhanced performance, such as computer
animation,
engineering design and other programs requiring high-resolution graphics. PSG provides workstations that run on both Windows® and Linux-based operating systems.

Handheld Computing.

PSG provides a series of HP iPAQ Pocket PC handheld computing devices that run on Windows® Mobile software.
These
products range from basic PDAs to advanced "smartphone" devices with voice and data capability.

Imaging and Printing Group

IPG is the leading imaging and printing systems provider in the world for consumer and commercial printer hardware, printing supplies,
printing media and scanning devices. IPG is also focused on imaging and printing solutions in the commercial markets, from managed print services solutions to addressing new growth opportunities in
commercial printing and capturing high-value pages



in
areas such as industrial applications, outdoor signage and the graphic arts business. When describing our performance in this segment, we group inkjet printer units and retail products and services
into consumer hardware, LaserJet and enterprise solutions and graphics solutions into commercial hardware and break out printer supplies separately.

Inkjet and Web Solutions.

This unit delivers our consumer and SMB inkjet solutions (hardware, ink, media) as well as developing our
retail and web
businesses. It includes single function and all-in-one inkjet printers targeted toward consumers and SMBs as well as retail publishing solutions, Snapfish and Logoworks.

LaserJet and Enterprise Solutions.

This unit is focused on delivering products and services to the enterprise segment. It includes
LaserJet printers
and supplies, multi-function printers, scanners and enterprise software solutions such as Exstream Software and Web Jetadmin.

Managed Enterprise Solutions.

This unit is focused on delivering managed print services products and solutions to Enterprise customers.
This unit
partners with third-party software providers to offer workflow solutions in the enterprise environment.

Graphics Solutions.

Graphics solutions include large format printing (Designjet, Scitex, ColorSpan and NUR), large format supplies,
inkjet
high-speed production (WebPress) solutions and supplies, Indigo printing and specialty printing systems.

Printer Supplies.

Printer supplies include LaserJet toner, inkjet cartridges, graphic solutions ink products, including inks for our
large format,
super-wide and digital press products, and other printing-related media. These supplies include HP-branded Vivera and ColorSphere ink and HP Premium and Premium Plus photo
papers, which are designed to work together as a system to produce faster prints with improved resistance to fading, increased print quality and better affordability.

HP Financial Services

HPFS supports and enhances HP's global product and service solutions, providing a broad range of value-added financial
life-cycle management services. HPFS enables our worldwide customers to acquire complete IT solutions, including hardware, software and services. The group offers leasing, financing,
utility programs and asset recovery services, as well as financial asset management services for large global and enterprise customers. HPFS also provides an array of specialized financial services to
SMBs and educational and governmental entities. HPFS offers innovative, customized and flexible alternatives to balance unique customer cash flow, technology obsolescence and capacity needs.

Corporate Investments

Corporate Investments includes Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, also known as HP Labs, and certain business incubation projects. Revenue
in this segment is attributable to the sale of certain network infrastructure products, including Ethernet switch products that enhance computing and enterprise solutions under the brand ProCurve
Networking. Corporate Investments also derives revenue from licensing specific HP technology to third parties.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We manage our business and report our financial results based on the principal business segments described above. Our customers are
organized by consumer and commercial customer groups, and distribution is organized by direct and channel. Within the channel, we have various types of partners that we utilize for various customer
groups. The partners include:

•

retailers that sell our products to the public through their own physical or Internet stores;

•

resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted
customer groups;

•

distribution partners that supply our solutions to smaller resellers with which we do not have direct relationships;



•

independent distributors that sell our products into geographies or customer segments in which we have little or no
presence;

•

original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") that integrate our products with their own hardware or software and sell the
integrated products;

•

independent software vendors ("ISVs") that provide their clients with specialized software products, frequently driving
sales of additional non-HP products and services, and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products; and

•

systems integrators that provide various levels and kinds of expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions
and often partner with HPS to extend their expertise or influence the sale of our products and services.

The
mix of HP's business by channel or direct sales differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions
necessitate sales, marketing and distribution to be tailored accordingly. HP is focused on driving the depth and breadth of its coverage in addition to efficiencies and productivity gains in both the
direct and indirect business.

The
HP Enterprise Business manages most of our enterprise and public sector customer relationships and also has primary responsibility for simplifying sales processes across our segments
to improve speed and effectiveness of customer delivery. In this capacity, the HP Enterprise Business manages our direct sales for value products including UNIX®, enterprise storage and
software and pre-sales technical consultants, as well as our direct distribution activities for commercial products and go-to-market activities with systems
integrators and ISVs. The HP Enterprise Business also drives HP's vertical sales and marketing approach in the communication, media and entertainment, financial services, manufacturing and
distribution and public sector industries.

PSG
manages SMB customer relationships and commercial reseller channels, due largely to the significant volume of commercial PCs that HP sells through these channels. In addition to
commercial channel relationships, the Volume Direct organization, which is charged with the management of direct sales for volume products, is hosted within PSG. In addition, PSG manages direct online
sales through the Consumer Exchange and the Small Business Exchange.

IPG
manages HP's overall consumer-related sales and marketing activities, including our annual consumer product launch for the back-to-school and holiday seasons.
IPG also manages consumer channel relationships with third-party retail locations for imaging and printing products, as well as other consumer products, including consumer PCs, which provides for a
bundled sale opportunity between PCs and IPG products.

Manufacturing and Materials

We utilize a number of outsourced manufacturers ("OMs") around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. The use of
OMs is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for certain HP-designed products. Third-party OEMs manufacture some products that we purchase and resell
under the HP brand. In addition to our use of OMs, we currently manufacture finished products from components and sub-assemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.

We
utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We employ building products to order capabilities to
maximize manufacturing efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Configuring products to order permits configuration of units to the particular hardware and software
customization requirements of certain customers. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory
holding



periods
by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers.

We
purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such sources
are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines, LaserJet supplies and parts for products with short life cycles (although some of these sources have operations in
multiple locations). We are dependent upon Intel as a supplier of processors and Microsoft for various software products. However, we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in
industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors. We also have a valued relationship with AMD, and we have continued to see
solid acceptance of AMD processors in the market during fiscal 2009.

Like
other participants in the high technology industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our
requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we experience significant price volatility and supply constraints of certain components that are not available from
multiple sources. Frequently, we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an impact on gross margin but does not disrupt production. On
occasion, we acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of
supply. See "Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly," in Item 1A, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

International

Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis
for both consumer and enterprise customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides
revenue streams to offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. In addition,
we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that target developing countries. In this regard, we believe that our broad geographic presence
gives us a solid base upon which to build such future growth.

A
summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property, plant and equipment is set forth in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8,
which is incorporated herein by reference. Approximately 64% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2009 came from outside the United States. The substantial majority of our net revenue originating
outside the United States was from customers other than foreign governments.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to HP's foreign operations, see "Risk Factors—Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other
factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition," in Item 1A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk" in Item 7A and Note 10
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Research and Development

We remain committed to innovation as a key element of HP's culture. Our development efforts are focused on designing and developing
products, services and solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can
make a unique contribution and the areas where



partnering
with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences.

HP
Labs, together with the various research and development groups within the five principal business segments, are responsible for our research and development efforts. HP Labs is part
of our Corporate Investments segment.

Expenditures
for research and development were $2.8 billion in fiscal 2009, $3.5 billion in fiscal 2008 and $3.6 billion in fiscal 2007. We anticipate that we will
continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services to maintain and enhance our
competitive position.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see "Risk Factors—If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and
services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Patents

Our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products
and services or where proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At October 31, 2009, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 33,000 patents, which was slightly above the
number of patents in our patent portfolio at the end of both fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007.

Patents
generally have a term of twenty years from the time they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms on the individual patents vary. While we
believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and maximizing our return on research and development investments, no single
patent is in itself essential to us as a whole or any of our principal business segments.

In
addition to developing our patents, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses under
patents owned by us when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors—Our revenue, cost of sales, and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or
enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein
by reference.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the diversity of our products and services
portfolio, including the large volume of products delivered from shelf or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles.
Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material to an understanding of our overall business.

Seasonality

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our
products experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales often are weaker
in the summer months and consumer sales often are stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand during the spring and early summer months also may



be
adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. See "Risk Factors—Our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less
predictable," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

We encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity. We compete primarily on the basis of technology,
performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support,
security and availability of application software and our Internet infrastructure offerings.

The
markets for each of our business segments are characterized by vigorous competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and
rapidly growing firms. Product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete
effectively on the basis of the factors listed above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and often market their
products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will continue to be critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have
to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.

On
a revenue basis we are the largest company offering our range of general purpose computers and personal information, imaging and printing products for industrial, scientific, business
and consumer applications, and IT services. We are the leader or among the leaders in each of our principal business segments.

The
competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below:

Enterprise Storage and Servers.

The areas in which ESS operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid and ongoing
technological
innovation and price reductions. Our competitors range from broad solution providers such as International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") to more focused competitors such as EMC Corporation
("EMC") and Network Appliance, Inc. in storage and Dell, Inc. ("Dell") in industry standard servers. We believe that our important competitive advantages in this segment include the six
technology components of our converged infrastructure initiatives: IT systems, power and cooling, security, management, virtualization and automation. We believe that our competitive advantages also
include our global reach and our significant intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities, which will contribute to further enhancements of our product and service
offerings and our ability to cross-sell our portfolio and leverage scale advantages in everything from brand to procurement leverage.

Services.

Our service businesses including HP Enterprise Services and Technology Services compete in IT support services, consulting and
integration,
infrastructure technology outsourcing, business process outsourcing and application services. The IT support services and consulting and integration markets have been under significant pressure as our
customers have reduced their IT budgets. However, this trend has benefited the outsourcing services business as customers drive toward lower IT management costs to enable more strategic investments.
Our competitors include IBM Global Services, Computer Sciences Corporation, systems integration firms such as Accenture Ltd. and offshore companies such as Fujitsu and India-based competitors
Wipro Ltd, Infosys Technologies Ltd. and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. We also compete with other traditional hardware providers, such as Dell, which are increasingly offering
services to support their products. Many of our competitors are able to offer a wide range of global services, and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition. Our service businesses
team with many companies to offer services, and those arrangements allow us to extend our reach and augment our capabilities. Our competitive advantages are evident in our deep technology expertise,
which includes multi-vendor environments, virtualization



and
automation, our strong track record of collaboration with clients and partners, and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global resources in SAP, Oracle and
Microsoft platforms.

HP Software.

The areas in which HP Software operates are fueled by rapidly changing customer requirements and technologies. We market
enterprise IT
management software in competition with IBM, Computer Associates International ("CAI"), BMC Software, Inc. and others. Our information management and business intelligence solutions compete with
products from companies like Symantec, IBM, EMC, CAI, and Teradata. We also deliver communications and media solutions that compete with products from IBM and various other competitors. As new
delivery mechanisms such as software-as-a-service come on the scene, we're also confronting less traditional competitors. Our differentiation lies in the breadth
and depth of our software and services portfolio and the scope of our market coverage.

Personal Systems Group.

The areas in which PSG operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid price reductions and
inventory
depreciation. Our primary competitors for the branded personal computers are Dell, Acer Inc., ASUSTeK Computer Inc., Apple Inc., Lenovo Group Limited and Toshiba Corporation. In
particular regions, we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or "white box" manufacturers. Our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio, our
innovation and research and development capabilities, our brand and procurement leverage, our ability to cross-sell our portfolio of offerings, our extensive service and support offerings and the
availability of our broad-based distribution of products from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.

Imaging and Printing Group.

The markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive, especially with respect to
pricing and
the introduction of new products and features. IPG's key competitors include Canon USA, Inc., Lexmark International, Inc., Xerox Corporation, Seiko Epson Corporation, Samsung
Electronics Co. Ltd. and Brother Industries, Ltd. In addition, independent suppliers offer refill and remanufactured alternatives for our supplies which, although generally offering
lower print quality and reliability, may be offered at lower prices and put pressure on our supplies sales and margins. Other companies also have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for
HP's laser and inkjet products, particularly in jurisdictions outside of the United States where adequate intellectual property protection may not exist. In recent years, we and our competitors have
regularly lowered prices on printer hardware both to reach new customers and in response to the competitive environment. Important areas for future growth include printer-based multi-function devices
in the office space, digital presses in our imaging and graphics space and driving color printing expansion in the office. We believe we will provide important new contributions in the home, the
office and publishing environments by providing comprehensive solutions.

HP Financial Services.

In our financing business, our competitors are captive financing companies, mainly IBM Global Financing, as well
as banks and
financial institutions. We believe our competitive advantage in this business over banks and financial institutions is our ability to finance products, services and total solutions.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors, see "Risk Factors—The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margin and prospects," in
Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Environment

Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including
laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the cleanup of



contaminated
sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become
liable under environmental laws.

Many
of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use, including laws regulating the manufacture
and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. Some of our products also are, or may in the future be, subject to requirements
applicable to their energy consumption. We face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the chemical and
materials composition of our products, their safe use, and their energy efficiency, including those that may result from climate change legislation. In the event our products become
non-compliant with these laws, they could be enjoined from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions, including fines.

We
also are subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for
specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). There is no assurance that such
existing or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on HP's operations or financial condition, although HP does not anticipate that effects of product take-back legislation
will be different or more severe for HP than the impacts on others in the electronics industry.

We
are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of
our business. We
meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services.

The
liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when HP considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs. Environmental costs and accruals
are presently not material to our operations or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws applicable to our operations or products will not have a
material adverse effect on HP's operations or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance may not be a
reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margin and prospects.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors may target
our key market segments. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our
products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security, availability of application software, and Internet infrastructure offerings. If our products, services, support and
cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our operations, results and prospects could be harmed.

Unlike
many of our competitors, we have a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of
these product lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources
available to them than our businesses that compete against them. Industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the
markets in which we compete, and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers.

We
may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin. The



markets
in which we do business, particularly the personal computer and printing markets, are highly competitive, and we encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services
from numerous companies globally. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers, printers and related products has been particularly intense as competitors have
aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for these products. In addition, competitors in some of
the markets in which we compete with a greater presence in lower-cost jurisdictions may be able to offer lower prices than we are able to offer. Our results of operations and financial
condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide pricing pressures.

Because
our business model is based on providing innovative and high quality products, we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our
competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and, therefore, our profitability could be
adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain
areas, which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects.

Even
if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry. Revenue and margins also could
decline due to increased competition from other types of products. For example, refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of HP's LaserJet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with HP's supplies
business. In addition, other companies have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for HP's LaserJet and inkjet products, particularly in jurisdictions outside of the United States where
adequate intellectual property protection may not exist. HP expects competitive refill and remanufacturing and cloned cartridge activity to continue to pressure margins in IPG, which in turn has a
significant impact on HP margins and profitability overall.

If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may
suffer.

The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and
uncertain, and any failure by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. We must make
long-term investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand
for our products and services. After we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low costs. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes
of products and configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at doing so at all or within a given product's life cycle. Any delay in the development, production or marketing
of a new product could result in our not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position.

In
the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and
manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third-party components included in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in
product testing to determine the cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions. However, we may have limited ability to control quality issues, particularly with respect to faulty
components manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or "patch"), we may delay shipment to customers, which would
delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other
costs, adversely affecting our profits. If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products, our operating margins could be



adversely
affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers' expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and
adversely affect our brand and reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

Economic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin and expenses.

Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions and the demand for computing and imaging products
and services in the markets in which we compete. Economic weakness and uncertainty have resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and
difficulty managing inventory levels. For example, we have recently experienced reduced revenue from our product businesses due to slowing global economic growth, declines in the availability of
credit, weakening consumer and business confidence, increased unemployment, reduced levels of capital expenditures and other challenges currently affecting the global economy. Sustained uncertainty
about current global economic conditions may result in our customers continuing to postpone spending, which could adversely affect demand for our products and services. Economic weakness and
uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to make accurate forecasts of revenue, gross margin and expenses.

We
also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross margin declines in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures, inventory
write downs and increases in component and manufacturing costs resulting from higher labor and material costs borne by our manufacturers and suppliers that, as a result of competitive pricing
pressures or other factors, we are unable to pass on to our customers. In addition, our business may be disrupted if we are unable to obtain equipment, parts and components from our
suppliers—and our suppliers from their suppliers—due to the insolvency of key suppliers or the inability of key suppliers to obtain credit.

Economic
weakness and uncertainty could cause our expenses to vary materially from our expectations. Any renewed financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets or
any significant financial services institution failures could negatively impact our treasury operations, as the financial condition of such parties may deteriorate rapidly and without notice in times
of market volatility and disruption. Poor financial performance of asset markets could lead to increased pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Other income and expense could vary
materially from expectations depending on changes in interest rates, borrowing costs, currency exchange rates, hedging expenses and the fair value of derivative instruments. Economic downturns also
may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses.

We depend on third-party suppliers, and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly.

Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services and our suppliers' ability to
deliver sufficient quantities of quality components, products and services at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical schedules. Given the wide variety of systems, products and services that
we offer, the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe, and the long lead times that are required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain
components and products, problems could arise in planning production and managing inventory levels that could seriously harm us. Other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages,
excess supply, risks related to the terms of our contracts with suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers, and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers, as described
below.

•

Shortages.

Occasionally we may experience a shortage of,
or a delay in receiving, certain components as a result of strong demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets, disputes
with suppliers (some of



whom
are also customers), disruptions in the operations of component suppliers, other problems experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers. In particular, our PC
business relies heavily upon outsourced manufacturers ("OMs") to manufacture its products and is therefore dependent upon the continuing operations of those OMs to fulfill demand for our PC products.
HP represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these OMs, and any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by HP with a particular OM could adversely affect the
operations and financial condition of the OM and lead to shortages or delays in receiving products from that OM. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these components may increase, we may be
exposed to quality issues or the components may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide
services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the specifications needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose time-sensitive sales, incur
additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to reengineer some products or service offerings,
resulting in further costs and delays.

•

Oversupply.

In order to secure components for the
provision of products or services, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition, we may purchase components
strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about the availability of future components. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a
temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our gross margin.

•

Contractual terms.

As a result of binding price or
purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase components or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond
to changing market conditions. In the event that we become committed to purchase components or services for prices in excess of the current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who
have access to components or services at lower prices, and our gross margin could suffer. In addition, many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same OMs and suppliers that we
utilize. Our competitors may obtain better pricing and other terms and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, and our ability to engage in
relationships with certain OMs and suppliers could be limited. The practice employed by our PC business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its OMs may
create large supplier receivables with the OMs that, depending on the financial condition of the OMs, may have risk of uncollectability. In addition, certain of our OMs and suppliers may decide
in the future to discontinue conducting business with us. Any of these actions by our competitors, OMs or suppliers could adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition.

•

Contingent workers.

We also rely on third-party suppliers
for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims
relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent
workers, as described above. Our ability to manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.

•

Single source suppliers.

Our use of single source
suppliers for certain components could exacerbate our supplier issues. We obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other
considerations. For example, we rely on Intel Corporation to provide us with a sufficient supply of processors for many of our



PCs,
workstations, handheld computing devices and servers, and some of those processors are customized for our products. New products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained from only
one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers. Replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers
initially may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations. For some components, such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from Intel, alternative
sources may not exist or those alternative sources may be unable to produce the quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase
components from single source suppliers under short-term agreements that contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with
limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single source suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect
the quality, quantity and price of components to HP. The loss of a single source supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the
contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins.

Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.

Our worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis,
floods, hurricanes, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics or pandemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly
self-insured. The occurrence of any of these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our corporate headquarters,
and a portion of our research and
development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults. In addition, all
six of our worldwide IT data centers are located in the southern United States, making our operations more vulnerable to natural disasters or other business disruptions occurring in that geographical
area. The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Shanghai, Singapore and India.
We also rely on major logistics hubs primarily in Asia to manufacture and distribute our products and in the southwestern United States to import products into the Americas region. Our operations
could be adversely affected if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations are disrupted for any reason, including natural disasters, information technology system failures,
military actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located
near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical areas is unknown, but our revenue, profitability and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake or
other natural disaster.

System security risks, data protection breaches and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to
customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.

Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential
information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software
programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce
or procure from third parties may contain defects in design



or
manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, bugs, viruses,
worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of
existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.

We
manage and store various proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data relating to our business. In addition, our outsourcing services business routinely processes,
stores and transmits large amounts of data for our clients, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent
disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our clients, including the potential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a
result of fraud, trickery or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential
liability for us, damage our brand and reputation or otherwise harm our business. We also could lose existing or potential customers for outsourcing services
or other information technology solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers' system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products. In
addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.

Portions
of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes
place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and
resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions
have adversely affected in the past, and in the future could adversely affect, our financial results, stock price and reputation.

The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable.

Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will
likely be different in future periods than our current results. Our revenue depends on the overall demand for our products and services. Delays or reductions in IT spending could materially adversely
affect demand for our products and services, which could result in a significant decline in revenues. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the
product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net revenue. In particular, IPG and certain of its business units such as printer supplies contribute significantly to our gross margin
and profitability. In addition, our services business has contributed significantly to our revenue and operating profit in recent periods. Competition, lawsuits, investigations and other risks
affecting those businesses therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. Certain segments, and ESS in particular, have a higher fixed cost structure and more
variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis. In addition, newer
geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the
operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, seasonal rebates, increased
component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period, which may necessitate
adjustments to our operations.



HP's stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of HP's stock difficult to predict.

HP's stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. Some of the factors that could affect our stock price
are:

•

speculation in the press or investment community about, or actual changes in, our business, strategic position, market
share, organizational structure, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost cutting efforts, value or liquidity of our investments, exposure to market
volatility, prospects, business combination or investment transactions, or executive team;

•

the announcement of new products, services, technological innovations or acquisitions by HP or its competitors;

•

quarterly increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin, earnings or cash flow from operations, changes in estimates by
the investment community or guidance provided by HP, and variations between actual and estimated financial results;

•

announcements of actual and anticipated financial results by HP's competitors and other companies in the IT industry; and

•

the timing and amount of share repurchases by HP.

General
or industry specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to HP's performance also may
affect the price of HP common stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In
addition, following periods of volatility in a company's securities, securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted. If instituted against HP, this type of litigation
could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.

Our revenue, cost of sales, and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend or if third
parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States, similar laws in other countries, and agreements
with our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain intellectual property rights in the technology and products we sell, provide or otherwise use in our operations.
However, any of our direct or indirect intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take
advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, either of which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other
competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to
protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use; this too could adversely affect our competitive position.

Because
of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by
third parties. We may not be able to obtain or continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses to
our intellectual property. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition, third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business
may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction. Consequently, we may lose a competitive



advantage
with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.

Third
parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. For example, in recent years individuals and groups have begun
purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies such as HP. If we cannot or do not license
the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms, or substitute similar technology from another source, our operations could be adversely affected. Even if we believe that the claims are without
merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and may divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might
require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements, pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from importing,
marketing or selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual obligations to us.

Finally,
our results of operations and cash flows could be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition, accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees.
In certain countries (primarily in Europe), proceedings are ongoing against HP in which groups representing copyright owners seek to impose upon and collect from HP levies upon equipment (such as PCs,
multifunction devices and printers) that they allege are copying devices under applicable laws. Other countries that have not imposed levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing
levy schemes, and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices. If imposed, the total amount of the copyright levies would depend
on the types of products determined to be subject to the levy, the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy, and the per unit fee for each type of product, all of
which may be affected by several factors, including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving HP and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable
countries, which could be substantial. Consequently, the ultimate impact of these potential copyright levies or similar fees, and the ability of HP to recover such amounts through increased prices,
remain uncertain.

Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition.

Sales outside the United States make up approximately 64% of our net revenue. In addition, an increasing portion of our business
activity is being conducted in emerging markets, including Brazil, Russia, India and China. Our future revenue, gross margin, expenses and financial condition could suffer due to a variety of
international factors, including:

•

ongoing instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation,
recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;

•

longer accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers;

•

trade regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products;

•

local labor conditions and regulations;

•

managing a geographically dispersed workforce;

•

changes in the regulatory or legal environment;

•

differing technology standards or customer requirements;



•

import, export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments,
which could increase our cost of doing business in certain jurisdictions, prevent us from shipping products to particular countries or markets, affect our ability to obtain favorable terms for
components, increase our operating costs or lead to penalties or restrictions;

•

difficulties associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes
in tax laws; and

•

fluctuations in freight costs, limitations on shipping and receiving capacity, and other disruptions in the transportation
and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and shipments.

The
factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we rely on manufacturers in
Taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture.

As
approximately 64% of our sales are from countries outside of the United States, other currencies, particularly the euro, the British pound, Chinese Yuan Renminbi and the Japanese yen,
can have an impact on HP's results (expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. Accordingly, fluctuations
in foreign currency rates, most notably the strengthening of the dollar against the euro, could have a material impact on our revenue growth in future periods. In addition, currency variations can
adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the
United States. We use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. The effectiveness of our hedges depends on
our ability to accurately forecast future cash flows, which is particularly difficult during periods of uncertain demand for our products and services and highly volatile exchange rates. As a result,
we could incur significant losses from our hedging activities if our forecasts are incorrect. In addition, our hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset any or more than a portion of the
adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial
condition.

In
many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us,
such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those
companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse
effect on our business and reputation.

If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margin and profitability could suffer.

We use a variety of different distribution methods to sell our products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors
and both direct and indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer
segments for our products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in
the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability. Other distribution risks are described below.



•

Our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of
our channel partners were to weaken.

Our
future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels, the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or
the loss of retail shelf space. Moreover, some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions,
including economic weakness and industry consolidation. Many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures. Considerable
trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could
experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors' financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken.

•

Our inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors.

We
must manage inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues. Distributors may increase orders during periods of
product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and
the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues, and
therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may
limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in
order to price our products effectively.

If we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions, our revenue may suffer.

Many of the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance and software
features and functionality; frequent introduction of new products; short product life cycles; and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance. Among the
risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing, variations in costs, delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing
products in anticipation of new introductions, difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated
demand, risks associated with customer qualification and evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application
software. If we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings, our revenue may decline.

Our
revenue and gross margin also may suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors. This is especially challenging when a product has a
short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction. Furthermore, sales of our new products and services may replace sales, or result in discounting of
some of our current offerings, offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction. There also may be overlaps in the current products and services of HP and portfolios acquired through mergers
and acquisitions that we must manage. In addition, it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue, margin and cost estimates and to achieve
operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates. Given the competitive nature of our industry, if any



of
these risks materializes, future demand for our products and services and our results of operations may suffer.

Our revenue and profitability could suffer if we do not manage the risks associated with our IT services business properly.

The size and significance of the IT services portion of our business has increased in recent periods. The risks that accompany that
business differ from those of our other businesses and include the following:

•

The pricing and other terms of some of our IT services agreements, particularly our long-term IT outsourcing
services agreements, require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts that could differ from actual results. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated
delays in connection with the performance of these engagements, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable, which would have an
adverse affect on the profit margin of our IT services business.

•

Some of our IT services agreements require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered
through billings over the life of the agreement. These agreements often involve the construction of new IT systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of new technologies.
Substantial performance risk exists in each agreement with these characteristics, and some or all elements of service delivery under these agreements are dependent upon successful completion of the
development, construction and deployment phases. Any failure to perform satisfactorily under these agreements may expose us to legal liability, result in the loss of customers and harm our reputation,
which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our IT services business.

•

Some of our outsourcing services agreements contain pricing provisions that permit a client to request a benchmark study
by a mutually acceptable third-party. The benchmarking process typically compares the contractual price of our services against the price of similar services offered by other specified providers in a
peer comparison group, subject to agreed upon adjustment and normalization factors. Generally, if the benchmarking study shows that our pricing has a difference outside a specified range, and the
difference is not due to the unique requirements of the client, then the parties will negotiate in good faith any appropriate adjustments to the pricing. This may result in the reduction of our rates
for the benchmarked services performed after the implementation of those pricing adjustments, which could decrease the revenues and profitability of our IT services business.

If we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations, our revenue could suffer.

Our contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with
federal, state, provincial and local governmental customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and
performance. Any failure by us to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil
and criminal penalties, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future
government contracting. In addition, we are currently, and in the future may be, subject to

qui tam

litigation brought by private individuals on behalf
of the government relating to our government contracts, which could include claims for up to treble damages. Further, any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings
surrounding them, regardless of its



accuracy,
may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. If our customer contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to
compete for new contracts is adversely affected, we could suffer a material reduction in expected revenue.

We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of HP's Consolidated Financial Statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have
a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

In connection with the preparation of HP's Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on
historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this report.
In addition, as discussed in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to provisions for legal proceedings and other
contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should
any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Unanticipated changes in HP's tax provisions, the adoption of a new U.S. tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts
we charge for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items in intercompany transactions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our
intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the
appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could
be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. In addition, our
effective tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the
valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of
deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition, President Obama's administration has
recently announced proposals for a new U.S. tax legislation that, if adopted, could adversely affect our tax rate. Any of these changes could affect our profitability.

Our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.

In some of our segments, our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's
total sales occur towards the end of such quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult,
increases the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially
greater than orders, there will be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of
each quarter. Other developments late in a quarter, such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions, could adversely



impact
inventory levels and results of operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.

We
experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition. For example, sales to governments
(particularly sales to the
United States government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are the
same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year. European sales are often
weaker during the summer months. Demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. Moreover, to the extent that we introduce new
products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches. Typically, our third
fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.

Any failure by us to execute on our strategy for operational efficiency successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected.

We have adopted an operating framework that includes a disciplined focus on operational efficiency. As part of this framework, we have
adopted several initiatives, including a multi-year program announced in 2006 to reduce real estate costs by consolidating several hundred HP real estate locations worldwide to fewer core
sites, and a multi-year process of examining every function and every one of our businesses and functions in order to optimize efficiency and reduce cost. We have also implemented a
workforce restructuring program in fiscal 2008 relating to our services business and a workforce restructuring program in fiscal 2009 relating to our product businesses.

Our
ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions, including
estimates and assumptions regarding the cost of consolidating real estate locations, the amount of accelerated depreciation or asset impairment to be incurred when we vacate facilities or cease using
equipment before the end of their respective lease term or asset life, and the costs and timing of other activities in connection with these initiatives. These estimates and assumptions are subject to
significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. In addition, there are significant risks associated with our workforce restructuring programs,
including potential delays in the implementation of those programs in highly regulated locations outside of the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia, decreases in employee morale, and the
failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial,
technical, sales, marketing and IT support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, skilled solutions providers in the IT
support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and competition for experienced employees in the IT industry can be intense. The failure to hire executives and key
employees or the loss of executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations.



Changes to our compensation and benefit programs could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.

Like other companies, HP has implemented changes to its compensation programs intended to reduce fixed costs, create a high performance
culture at all levels and provide an opportunity for employees to earn significant rewards if HP delivers strong financial results. These changes included reducing base pay for many employees;
lowering the cap on matching contributions under the HP 401(k) Plan; making the funding of the HP 401(k) Plan matching contributions fully discretionary depending on quarterly business results; and
eliminating the purchase price discount for shares purchased under the HP Share Ownership Plan, all of which were announced in February 2009. HP also has reduced the total number of share-based
payment awards granted to employees and the number of employees who receive share-based payment awards. Due to these changes in our compensation programs, we may find it difficult to attract, retain
and motivate employees, and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business. Moreover, any difficulty relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans could
limit our ability to grant share-based payment awards to employees in the future.

Terrorist acts, conflicts and wars may seriously harm our business and revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts or wars (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to HP, our employees, facilities,
partners, suppliers, distributors, resellers or customers. The potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other
actual or potential conflicts or wars, including the ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have created many economic and political uncertainties. In addition, as a major multi national
company with headquarters and significant operations located in the United States, actions against or by the United States may impact our business or employees. Although it is impossible to predict
the occurrences or consequences of any such events, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive
components from our suppliers, create delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and
interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.

Any failure by us to identify, manage, complete and integrate acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results,
business and prospects, and the costs, expenses and other financial and operational effects associated with managing, completing and integrating acquisitions may result in financial results that are
different than expected.

As part of our business strategy, we frequently acquire complementary companies or businesses, divest non-core businesses
or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business (collectively, "business combination and investment transactions"). In order to pursue this
strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions, some of which may be large and complex, and manage
post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business combination and investment
transaction, and the timeframe for achieving benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, suppliers or other third parties. In
addition, the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter into these contracts, and,
during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate our costs accurately. Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated delays or failure to achieve
contractual obligations could make these transactions less profitable or unprofitable. Moreover, if we fail to identify and complete



successfully
business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at
a competitive disadvantage or we may be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin and profitability.

Integration
issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. The challenges
involved in integration include:

•

combining product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;

•

convincing customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus,
preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers (which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer
uncertainty), minimizing sales force attrition and coordinating sales, marketing and distribution efforts;

•

consolidating and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various
acquisitions and integrating software code;

•

minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;

•

persuading employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees,
engaging with employee works councils representing an acquired company's non-U.S. employees, integrating employees into HP, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing
restructuring programs;

•

coordinating and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries,
facilities and relationships with third parties in accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;

•

achieving savings from supply chain integration; and

•

managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.

Integration
and other risks associated with business combination and investment transactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions. For example, in August
2008, we completed our acquisition of EDS, and we are in the process of integrating EDS into our company. The size of the acquisition of EDS increases both the scope and consequence of ongoing
integration risks. We may not successfully address the integration challenges in a timely manner, or at all, and we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of the EDS
acquisition. If we fail to realize such anticipated benefits or synergies, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.

Managing
business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. These business
combination and investment transactions also have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early
retirement costs, employee benefit costs, asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, in-process research and development charges,
inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.
Moreover, HP has incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment
transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired,
we may be required to incur additional material charges



relating
to the impairment of those assets. In order to complete an acquisition, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders. In addition, we may borrow to
finance an acquisition, and the amount and terms of any potential future acquisition-related borrowings, as well as other factors, could affect our liquidity and financial condition and potentially
our credit ratings. Any potential future downgrades in our credit rating associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow and cost of borrowing and result in more
restrictive borrowing terms. In addition, HP's effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and business combination and investment transactions could impact our effective tax rate. We also
may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a business combination and investment transaction and the risk that an announced business combination and investment transaction
may not close. As a result, any completed, pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment community's expectations in a given quarter.

Unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws
addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of our products and the
recycling, treatment and disposal of our products including batteries. In particular, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future
requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products and product take-back legislation. We
could incur substantial costs, our products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and we could face other sanctions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws
or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws. Our potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury
claims and clean up costs. Further, liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively, on a joint and several basis, and without any finding of
noncompliance or fault. The amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict.

Some anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.

We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or
discouraging an acquisition of HP deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions:

•

authorizing blank check preferred stock, which HP could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior
to our common stock;

•

limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, HP's directors and officers;

•

specifying that HP stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and
otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;

•

requiring advance notice of proposals by HP stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for
nominations of candidates for election to our Board of Directors;

•

requiring a vote by the holders of two-thirds of HP's outstanding shares to amend certain bylaws relating to
HP stockholder meetings, the Board of Directors and indemnification; and

•

controlling the procedures for conduct of HP Board and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of HP
directors.



These
provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or management of HP. As a Delaware corporation, HP also is subject to
provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of
the holders of substantially all of HP's outstanding common stock.

Any
provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of HP could limit the opportunity for our
stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of HP common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for HP common stock.

ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

ITEM 2. Properties.

As of October 31, 2009, we owned or leased a total of approximately 77 million square feet of space worldwide. We owned
45% of this space and leased the remaining 55%. Included in these amounts are 10 million square feet of vacated space, of which 3 million square feet is leased to non HP interests. We
believe that our existing properties are in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business.

As
of October 31, 2009, HP core sales and support operations occupied approximately 12 million square feet. We own 40% of the space used for sales and support activities
and lease the remaining 60%.

HP
core manufacturing plants, research and development facilities and warehouse and administrative facilities occupied approximately 55 million square feet. We own 46% of our
manufacturing, research and development, warehouse and administrative space and lease the remaining 54%. Our plants are equipped with machinery, most of which we own and which, in part, we developed
to meet the special requirements of our manufacturing processes. At the end of fiscal 2009, we are continuing to execute on our plan to reduce our real estate costs and increase our productive
utilization by consolidating several hundred HP core real estate locations worldwide.

As
indicated above, we have seven business segments: Services, ESS, HP Software, PSG, IPG, HPFS, and Corporate Investments. Because of the interrelation of these segments, a majority of
these segments use substantially all of the properties at least in part, and we retain the flexibility to use each of the properties in whole or in part for each of the segments.

HP
repurchased shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 under an ongoing program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans as well as to repurchase
shares opportunistically. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. All shares repurchased in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2009 were purchased in open market transactions.

As
of October 31, 2009, HP had remaining authorization of approximately $4.0 billion for future share repurchases under the $8.0 billion repurchase authorization

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere in this document.

OVERVIEW

We are a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and
medium-sized businesses, and large enterprises, including customers in the government, health and education sectors. Our offerings span:

•

multi-vendor customer services, including infrastructure technology and business process outsourcing, technology support
and maintenance, application development and support services, and consulting and integration services;

•

enterprise information technology infrastructure, including enterprise storage and server technology, networking products
and resources, and software that optimizes business technology investments;

•

personal computing and other access devices; and

•

imaging and printing-related products and services.

We
have seven business segments for financial reporting purposes: Services, Enterprise Storage and Servers ("ESS"), HP Software, the Personal Systems Group ("PSG"), the Imaging and
Printing Group ("IPG"), HP Financial Services ("HPFS"), and Corporate Investments. Services, ESS and HP Software are reported collectively as a broader HP Enterprise Business (formerly referred to as
the Technology Solutions Group). While the HP Enterprise Business is not an operating segment, we sometimes provide financial data aggregating the segments within it in order to provide a
supplementary view of our business.

Our
strategy and operations are currently focused on the following initiatives:

Competitive Positioning

We are positioning our businesses to take advantage of important trends in the markets for our products and services. For example, we
are aligning our printing business to capitalize on key market trends such as the shift from analog to digital printing and the growth in printable content by developing innovative products for
consumers such as the first web-connected home printer, working to enable web and mobile printing, expanding our presence in high-usage annuity businesses including graphics
and retail photo printing, and growing our managed print services business. We are also positioning our enterprise business to capitalize on the trend towards converged infrastructure products that
integrate storage, networking, servers and management software. In addition, we have developed IT management software offerings that seek to satisfy the increasing demand for virtualization management
and increased automation.

Driving Operational Efficiency

We have implemented an ongoing program to optimize efficiency and reduce cost across the company. As part of those efforts, we are
continuing to execute on our multi-year program to consolidate real estate locations worldwide to fewer core sites in order to reduce our IT spending and



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

real
estate costs. In addition, we are continuing to implement the restructuring plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 to optimize the cost structure of our services business and the
restructuring plan announced in May 2009 to structurally change and improve the effectiveness of several of our product businesses. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8 for further discussion of these restructuring plans and the associated restructuring charges.

We
also took actions in fiscal 2009 to further improve our cost structure and further shift our employee compensation structure from fixed to variable. As part of those actions, we
reduced base pay for many of our employees, we reduced the matching contributions under the HP 401(k) Plan for all U.S. employees and began funding these matching contributions quarterly on a
discretionary basis based on our financial performance, and we modified our employee stock purchase plan to eliminate the discount applicable to purchases made under the plan. We are continuing to
evaluate our businesses and market conditions and may consider additional restructuring or other actions in future periods.

Investing for Growth

We are investing some of the savings derived from our efficiency initiatives for growth. For example, we are increasing our sales
coverage to expand the size of the market that we cover, including expanding into emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil. We are creating innovative new products and developing new channels
to connect with our customers, particularly in our PC business. In addition, we are expanding our portfolio of products and services that we can offer to our customers, both through acquisitions and
through organic growth. A critical component of this strategy was our acquisition of Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") in August 2008, which has increased the size and breadth of our
services business and enabled us to provide comprehensive IT product and services solutions to our customers.

In
November 2009, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 3Com Corporation, a global enterprise provider of networking switching, routing and security solutions, at a price of
$7.90 per share in cash or an enterprise value of approximately $2.7 billion. The acquisition is subject to customary
closing conditions, including the receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and the approval of 3Com's stockholders. The transaction is expected to close in our second fiscal quarter of
2010.

Leveraging our Portfolio and Scale

We now offer one of the IT industry's broadest portfolios of products and services, and we are working to leverage that portfolio as a
strategic advantage. For example, in our enterprise business, we are able to provide servers, storage and networking packaged with services that can be delivered to customers in the manner of their
choosing, be it in-house, outsourced or as a service via the Internet. Our portfolio of management software completes the package by allowing our customers to manage their IT operations in
an efficient and cost-effective manner. In addition, we are working to optimize our supply chain by eliminating complexity, reducing fixed costs, and leveraging our scale to ensure the
availability of components at favorable prices even during shortages. We are also expanding our use of industry standard components in our enterprise products to further leverage our scale.

Cash
and cash equivalents at October 31, 2009 totaled $13.3 billion, an increase of $3.1 billion from the October 31, 2008 balance of $10.2 billion.
The increase for fiscal 2009 was due primarily to $13.4 billion of cash provided from operations and $1.8 billion of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock
plans, which were partially offset by $5.1 billion of cash used to repurchase common stock, $3.2 billion net investment in property, plant and equipment, and $2.8 billion net
payment of our debt.

We
intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements,
the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and
estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment.

For
a further discussion of trends, uncertainties and other factors that could impact our operating results, see the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, which is
incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

General

The Consolidated Financial Statements of HP are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"),
which require management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of
these estimates with the Audit Committee of HP's Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

reasonable;
however, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

An
accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is
made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes the
following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and, while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and
conditions, there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine
the appropriate accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if
so, how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered elements have standalone
value, uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customer-negotiated refund or return rights for the delivered elements. If the arrangement includes a
customer-negotiated refund or return right relative to the delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control, the
delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting.
Changes in the allocation of the sales price between elements may impact the timing of revenue recognition but will not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.

We
recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements. Using a proportional performance method, we estimate the total expected labor
costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date. We follow this basis because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be
made. Total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of the contract. We record changes in revenue to income, as a result of revisions to cost estimates, in the period in which the
facts that give rise to the revision become known.

We
recognize revenue on certain design and build (design, development and/or construction of software and/or systems) projects using the percentage-of-completion
method. We use the cost-to-cost method of measurement towards completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the total estimated costs of the project. In circumstances when
reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made, we recognize revenue using the completed contract method.

We
record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, promotions, other volume-based incentives and
expected returns. Future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at
the time the incentive is offered. Additionally, certain incentive programs require us to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive.

In
October 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2009-13, "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements"



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

("ASU 2009-13").
The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement
consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price. The selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if available, third-party evidence
("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

Concurrently
to issuing ASU 2009-13, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2009-14, "Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements"
("ASU 2009-14"). ASU 2009-14 excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to
the tangible product's functionality.

HP
early adopted the provisions of ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 for new and materially modified deals originating
after November 1, 2008; therefore the previously reported quarterly results have been restated to reflect the impact of adoption.

We
establish VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant
authority. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. The best estimate
of selling price is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle. Consideration is
also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles. When determining our best estimate of selling price, we apply management judgment when
establishing margin objectives and pricing strategies and evaluating market conditions and product lifecycles. We may modify or develop new go-to-market practices in the
future. As these go-to-market strategies evolve, we may modify our pricing practices in the future, which may result in changes in selling prices, impacting both VSOE and ESP.
The aforementioned factors may result in a different allocation of revenue to the deliverables in multiple element arrangements from the current fiscal year, which may change the pattern and timing of
revenue recognition for these elements but will not change the total revenue recognized for the arrangement.

The
adoption of ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 was not material to our financial results, increasing net revenues and net earnings by $255 million and
$55 million, respectively for fiscal 2009. The primary driver of the impact was the number of new or materially modified deals, particularly impacting the second half of the fiscal year, which
was driven by economic and customer-specific factors. An additional driver of the impact was the extent of hardware or shorter-term service projects sold into longer-term
complex service arrangements in a particular quarter, which may vary significantly on a deal-by-deal basis. We are not able to reasonably estimate the effect of adopting these standards on future
financial periods as the impact will vary based on the nature and volume of new or materially modified deals in any given period.

Business Combinations

We allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets
acquired, including in-process research and development ("IPR&D"), based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over these fair values is recorded as goodwill. We
engage independent third-party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Such valuations require management to make significant estimates
and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. The significant



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

purchased
intangible assets recorded by us include customer contracts and lists, developed and core technology and the Compaq trade name. The fair values assigned to the identified intangible assets
are discussed in detail in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Critical
estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited to: future expected cash flows from customer contracts, customer lists, distribution agreements, and
acquired developed technologies and patents; expected costs to develop IPR&D into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed; Compaq brand awareness and market
position, as well as assumptions about the period of time the brand will continue to be used in our product portfolio; and discount rates. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon
assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates.

Other
estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as more
fully discussed in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Restructuring

We have engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates
related to expenses for severance and other employee separation costs, realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete, lease cancellation and other exit costs. If the actual amounts differ
from our estimates, the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted. For a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions of restructuring in the Results
of Operations section and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

We recognize stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards, net of an estimated forfeiture rate. We recognize
compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award.

Determining
the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards requires subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share-based
payment awards and stock price volatility. We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the stock options granted under our principal option plans. To implement this model, we examined
our historical pattern of option exercises to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations. From this analysis, we identified three employee
populations to which to apply the Black-Scholes model. We determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on HP common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility
and future stock price trends than historical volatility. Therefore, expected volatility used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007 was based on market-based
implied volatility.

We
issue performance-based restricted units ("PRUs") representing hypothetical shares of HP common stock. Each PRU award reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the
award recipient. We determine the actual number of shares the recipient receives at the end of a three-year performance period based on results achieved versus goals based on our annual
cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue and average total shareholder return ("TSR") relative to the S&P 500 over the performance period. We use historic volatility for PRU awards
as implied volatility



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

cannot
be used when simulating multivariate prices for companies in the S&P 500. We estimate the fair value of PRUs using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as the TSR modifier contains a market
condition. We update the estimated expense, net of forfeitures, for the cashflow performance against the goal for that year at the end of each reporting period.

The
assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the
application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we
are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the
stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period. See Note 2
to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion on stock-based compensation.

Taxes on Earnings

We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results
reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year. We record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them, which is generally in the third and
fourth quarters of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions, respectively.

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely
than not to realize. We have considered future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax
planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future,
we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than
not to realize the net deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able
to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

Our
effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided U.S. taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely
outside the United States. We plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long-term investment requirements of our
foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we will distribute to the United States and provide the U.S. federal taxes due on these amounts.
Further, as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments we have undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some
cases is wholly exempt from taxes, for fiscal years through 2022. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term investment requirements in the various
jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

We
are subject to income taxes in the United States and over sixty foreign countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe
that our tax return positions are fully supported, but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions, which may not be fully sustained. However, our income tax expense includes amounts
intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities
requires management judgments and estimates. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the guidance for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. We believe that our reserve for
uncertain tax positions, including related interest, is adequate. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income
tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. Our reserve for uncertain tax positions is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning
the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of income among different jurisdictions, and related interest. We review our reserves quarterly, and we may adjust such
reserves because of proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations or new case law, previously unavailable information obtained during the
course of an examination, negotiations between tax authorities of different countries concerning our transfer prices, execution of Advanced Pricing Agreements, resolution with respect to individual
audit issues, the resolution of entire audits, or the expiration of statutes of limitations.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we have not overstated our trade and
financing receivables balances due to uncollectibility. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all customers based on a variety of factors, including the use of third-party credit risk
models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, the financial condition of customers, the length of time receivables are past due, trends in overall
weighted-average risk rating of the total portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, significant one-time events and historical experience. Also, we record specific provisions for individual
accounts when we become aware of specific customer circumstances, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances
related to customers change, we would further adjust our estimates of the recoverability of receivables either upward or downward. The annual general provision for doubtful accounts has averaged
approximately 0.06% of net revenue over the last three fiscal years. Using our third-party credit risk model at October 31, 2009, a 50-basis-point deterioration in the
weighted-average default probabilities of our significant customers would have resulted in an approximately $36 million increase to our trade allowance at the end of fiscal year 2009.

Inventory

We state our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value,
if required, at the product group level for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, rapid technological changes, product
life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues. Revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our
estimates.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Valuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The provisions of Accounting Standards Codification Topic 350, "Intangibles—Goodwill and Other" require that
we perform a two-step impairment test on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the
reportable segments identified in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market
approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value
based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not
impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform
the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair
value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We also compare the fair value of purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives to their carrying value. We estimate the fair
value of these intangible assets using an income approach. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.

Determining
the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates,
future economic and
market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain.
Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of
our reporting units.

Our
annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of fair value over carrying value
for each of HP's reporting units as of August 1, 2009, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately $750 million to approximately $35 billion. In order to evaluate the
sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease would
result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $550 million to approximately $31 billion for each of HP's reporting units.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

We measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on valuation techniques using the best information available,
which may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Financial instruments are primarily comprised of time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper,
corporate and other debt securities, equity securities and other investments in common stock and common stock equivalents and derivative instruments.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

We measure fair value using the framework established by the FASB accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. This framework requires fair
value to be determined based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.

The
valuation techniques are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable or market inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs require
management to make certain assumptions and judgments based on the best information available. Observable inputs are the preferred source of values. These two types of inputs create the following fair
value hierarchy:

Level 1—Quoted
prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets.

Level 2—Quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based
valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3—Prices
or valuations that require management inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

A
description of the valuation methodologies we use to measure our financial assets and liabilities at fair value is provided below.

Cash
Equivalents and Investments: We hold time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, other debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and
bonds, and common stock and equivalents. In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. If quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets are not available to determine fair value, then we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. If quoted prices
for identical or similar assets are not available, we use internally developed valuation models, whose inputs include bid prices, and third party valuations utilizing underlying asset assumptions.

Derivative
Instruments: As discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, we mainly hold non-speculative forwards, swaps and options
to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. When active market quotes are not available, we use industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future
cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for
currencies. In certain cases, market-based observable inputs are not available and, in those cases, we use management judgment to develop assumptions which are used to determine fair value.

Warranty Provision

We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a
product group basis. Our standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of
time. While we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty
obligation upon warranty terms, ongoing product failure rates, repair costs, product



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

call
rates, average cost per call, and current period product shipments. If actual product failure rates, repair rates or any other post sales support costs were to differ from our estimates, we would
be required to make revisions to the estimated warranty liability. Warranty terms generally range from
90 days to three years parts and labor, depending upon the product. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty provision has averaged approximately 3.5% of annual net product
revenue, while actual annual warranty costs have averaged approximately 3.3% of annual net product revenue.

Retirement Benefits

Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions. Our major
assumptions relate primarily to discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. We base the discount rate assumption on current investment
yields of high quality fixed income investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual experience and future and
near-term outlook. Long-term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management's expectation of the future economic environment, as well
as target asset allocations.

In
the beginning of fiscal 2008, we implemented a liability-driven investment strategy for the HP U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which was frozen effective December 31, 2007.
As part of the strategy, we transitioned our investment allocation for that plan to predominantly fixed income assets. In fiscal 2008, we acquired EDS. The EDS U.S. defined benefit plan assets were
invested predominantly in public equity and alternative investments. At the end of fiscal 2009, the assets of the HP and EDS plans were merged, resulting in a portfolio with a blend of fixed income,
equities and alternatives. The expected return on the plan assets, used in calculating the net benefit cost, is 7.99% for fiscal 2010, which reflects the target asset allocation of the merged
portfolio.

Our
medical cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Actual results
that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated future working life of the plan participants.

Our
major assumptions vary by plan and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated
herein by reference. Each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics, and, in general, changes, if any, have moved in the same direction over the last several years. For fiscal 2009, changes
in the weighted-average rates for the HP benefit plans would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost:

•

A decrease of 25 basis points in the long-term rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by
approximately $43 million;

•

A decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately
$71 million; and

•

An increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately
$15 million.

Loss Contingencies

We are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. We record a
provision for a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant

judgment
is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions at least quarterly and adjust these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations,
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should
any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In September 2006, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to fair value measurements. The new standard defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued a new provision which delayed the effective date of the fair
value measurements and disclosures for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis (at least annually). In August 2009, the FASB issued ASU No. 2009-05, "Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value" in relation to the fair value measurement of liabilities. We
adopted the applicable portions of the provisions of the new standards in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, and will adopt the provision related to the
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Although we will continue to evaluate the application of the provision for the nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities, we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8
for additional information pertaining to fair value measurements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to business combinations. The new standard expands the definition of a business and a business combination; requires
recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognized in earnings; requires
acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs to be recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred; requires in-process research and development to be
capitalized at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset; and requires that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the
measurement period be recognized as a component of provision for taxes. The new standard also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the
business combination. In April 2009, the FASB issued a new standard which clarified the accounting for pre-acquisition contingencies. We will adopt these new business combination standards
in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The impact of adoption will be largely dependent on the size and nature of the business combinations completed after the adoption of this statement.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to noncontrolling interests. The new standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests
in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent's ownership interest,
and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. The new standard also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish
between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. We will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We do not expect the adoption of
this standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

In
May 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to convertible debt instruments. The new standard requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be
settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's
non-convertible debt borrowing rate. We will adopt this new accounting standard on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We do not expect the adoption of this standard
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that clarifies whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions should be included in computing earnings per share.
Under the new standard, we will be required to include restricted stock that contains non-forfeitable rights to dividends in our calculation of basic earnings per share ("EPS"), and will
need to calculate basic EPS using the "two-class method." The two-class method of computing EPS is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for each class of common
stock and participating securities according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. We will adopt this new accounting standard on a retrospective
basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We do not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our calculation of basic EPS.

In
November 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to defensive intangible assets. Defensive intangible assets are acquired intangible assets that the acquirer does not
intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them. Under the new standard, defensive intangible assets must be initially recognized at fair value and
amortized over the benefit period. We will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The impact of adoption will be largely dependent on the size and nature of business
combinations completed after the date of adoption.

In
December 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that requires additional disclosures about assets held in an employer's defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
We will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We will present the required disclosures in the prescribed format on a prospective basis upon adoption. This new
standard will only affect the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to transfers of financial assets. It amends previous guidance to remove the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity
and its exemption from consolidation in the transferor's financial statements. This new standard also establishes conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale,
modifies the financial-asset derecognition criteria, revises how interests retained by the transferor in a sale of financial assets are initially measured, removes the guaranteed mortgage
securitization recharacterization provisions, and requires additional disclosures. We will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We do not expect the adoption of this
standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. It eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for
determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This
new standard also requires additional disclosures about an enterprise's involvement in variable interest entities. We will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. We
are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, we adopted the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which only affected the
specific references to GAAP literature in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

In
October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-13. The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and
requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price. Concurrently to issuing ASU 2009-13, the FASB also issued ASU
2009-14. ASU 2009-14 excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible
product's functionality.

A
further discussion of the financial impact of ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 appears under "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates" above.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion compares the historical results of operations on a GAAP basis for the fiscal years ended October 31,
2009, 2008, and 2007. We have included the results of the business operations acquired from EDS in our consolidated results of operations beginning on August 26, 2008, the closing date of the
EDS acquisition.

Fiscal 2009

In
fiscal 2009, the global slowdown of IT and consumer spending impacted each of our segments. Net revenue decreased 3.2% in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008
(increased 1.3% on a constant currency basis). The unfavorable currency impact for fiscal 2009 was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro. For fiscal 2009, the Services segment
contributed favorably to the total HP net revenue change primarily as a result of the EDS acquisition. U.S. net revenue increased 12% to $41.3 billion for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal
2008, while net revenue from outside of the United States decreased 10% to $73.2 billion. The increase in U.S. net revenue in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily a result of the
acquisition of EDS.

The
PSG net revenue decline in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily the result of the overall slowdown in the global economy. PSG average selling prices ("ASPs") declined in both
consumer clients and commercial clients. The ASP decline in fiscal 2009 was offset slightly by an increase in the option and monitor attach rates. PSG unit volumes, however, increased slightly in
fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008.

IPG
experienced net revenue declines in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 in the commercial and consumer hardware business units and in the supplies business unit. Unit volume declines across
each of the business units were a result of the softness in both the business and consumer demand environments.

ESS
net revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 driven by declines in our industry standard servers ("ISS"), business critical systems and storage business units. The revenue
declines were due primarily to the economic slowdown and overall weak demand environment. ISS unit volumes and average unit prices declined in fiscal 2009 as compared to the prior year.

HP
Software experienced net revenue declines in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 in both the business technology optimization ("BTO") business unit and the other software business unit due
primarily to revenue declines in licenses and services, the effect of which was partially offset by increased support revenue as a result of renewal rate increases.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

Net
revenue in Corporate Investments and Other declined in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008, resulting from lower sales of network infrastructure products primarily as a result of the
slowdown in the networking market.

HPFS
net revenue decreased in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due to unfavorable currency movements.

The
net revenue increase in Services in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due primarily to net revenue increases in infrastructure technology outsourcing, application services and
business process outsourcing primarily as a result of the EDS acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the effect of which was partially offset by unfavorable currency impacts and a decline
in spending from existing customers. Net revenue in technology services declined in fiscal 2009 due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and weak economic conditions, the effect of which was
partially offset by growth in extended warranty.

Fiscal 2008

In
fiscal 2008, HP net revenue increased approximately 13.5% from the prior-year period (8.4% on a constant currency basis). The favorable currency
impact for fiscal 2008 was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro. U.S. net revenue was $36.9 billion for fiscal 2008, an increase of 6% from the prior year, while
international net revenue increased 17% to $81.4 billion.

PSG
net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 as a result of a unit volume increase of 22%. The unit volume increase was the result of strong growth in notebooks with
continued strength in emerging markets. The positive revenue impact from this unit volume increase was moderated by declines in ASPs in commercial and consumer clients of 7% and 4%, respectively.

IPG
net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 due to the growth in supplies net revenue as a result of higher unit volumes with strong performance from color-related
products. For fiscal 2008, commercial hardware net revenues increased slightly, while consumer hardware net revenues declined due primarily to competitive pricing pressures and a slowing economy.

ESS
net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 over the prior-year period due primarily to strong performance in storage, which was due in part to growth within our EVA and MSA
product lines, and revenue growth in industry standard servers from increased unit volumes and blade revenues. Fiscal 2008 revenues in business critical systems were flat compared to the
prior-year period.

HP
Software net revenue growth in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was attributable to strong growth in our BTO business unit resulting from revenue increases in support, growth in license
revenue, partially as a result of our acquisition of Opsware Inc. ("Opsware") in September 2007, and, to a lesser extent, increased services contract sales.

HPFS
net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 from the prior year due primarily to an increase in the mix of operating leases as a portion of our asset portfolio and growth in average
portfolio assets.

Services
net revenue increased in fiscal 2008 over the prior year due primarily to net revenue increases in technology services, infrastructure technology outsourcing, application
services and business process outsourcing primarily as a result of the EDS acquisition on August 26, 2008.

Fiscal 2009

Total
company gross margin decreased by 0.6 percentage points in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. From a segment perspective and on a weighted
basis, ESS had the largest impact to the total company gross margin decline due to mix and rate declines.

ESS
gross margin decreased in fiscal 2009 from the prior year due primarily to competitive pricing across each of the segment business units and product mix shifts.

The
gross margin in our Services segment increased for fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due primarily to the continued focus on cost structure improvements, including delivery efficiencies
and cost controls in our technology services business, and EDS-related acquisition synergies. This was partially offset by the mix effect from the acquisition of the EDS business, which has lower
gross margins.

The
increase in HP Software gross margin in fiscal 2009 from the prior year resulted primarily from a favorable support and services revenue mix and improved services margins, the effect
of which was partially offset by an unfavorable license revenue mix.

The
HPFS gross margin decline in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was driven by unfavorable currency impacts, lower margins relating to end-of-lease activities,
higher bad debt expenses and lower margins for remarketing and buyout activities, the effect of which was partially offset by higher portfolio margins.

Gross
margin in Corporate Investments and Other declined for fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 as a result of a unit volume decline in the sale of network infrastructure products and
competitive pricing pressures.

The
improvement in IPG gross margin in fiscal 2009 from the prior year resulted primarily from an increase in the supplies mix and supplies pricing, the effect of which was partially
offset by hardware margin declines.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

PSG
had the most favorable impact to the change in total company gross margin due to the mix effect of its gross margin representing a smaller component of our total gross margin from
levels experienced in the prior-year period.

PSG
gross margin declined in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008, resulting from ASPs declining at a faster pace than component costs combined with a mix shift towards lower-end
products, the effects of which were partially offset by lower warranty and supply chain costs and improvements in the option attach rate.

Fiscal 2008

Total
company gross margin decreased slightly in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007. On a segment basis, an increase in HP Software gross margin and a small increase
in ESS gross margin were offset by small gross margin declines in Services and HPFS and flat gross margin growth across our remaining segments.

The
slight improvement in ESS gross margin in fiscal 2008 from the prior year was primarily a result of improved cost management and attach rates in industry standard servers.

Services
gross margin declined in fiscal 2008 from the prior year due primarily to the impact from the continued competitive pricing environment, partially offset by the continued focus
on cost structure improvements generated by delivery efficiencies and cost controls.

For
fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, the improvement in HP Software gross margin was primarily the result of cost savings in the BTO business unit.

HPFS
gross margin declined slightly in fiscal 2008 due primarily to higher bad debt expenses, the effect of which was partially offset by increased margins on
end-of-lease activity.

IPG
gross margin remained flat in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 with improved supplies margins resulting from mix shifts being offset by unfavorable hardware margins.

In
fiscal 2008, PSG gross margin remained flat due primarily to declining ASPs offset by an increase in the attach rate of higher-margin options.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

Total
research and development ("R&D") expense decreased in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due primarily to favorable currency impacts related to the
movement of the dollar against the euro, as well as effective cost controls, the effect of which was partially offset by additional expenses related primarily to Services. In fiscal 2009, R&D expense
as a percentage of net revenue decreased for ESS, PSG, and IPG, and increased for HP Software, Services and Corporate Investments.

Total
R&D decreased in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007, due primarily to effective cost controls, the impact of which was partially offset by the unfavorable currency impacts
related to the movement of the dollar against the euro. Each of our major segments experienced a year-over-year decrease in R&D expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal
2008.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling,
general and administrative ("SG&A") expense decreased in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due primarily to favorable currency impacts related to the
movement of the dollar against the euro, lower compensation expense as well as effective cost management, the impact of which was partially offset by additional expenses related to the EDS
acquisition. In fiscal 2009,
SG&A expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased for each of our segments, except for Corporate Investments.

Total
SG&A expense increased in fiscal 2008 due primarily to higher field selling costs as a result of our investments in sales resources, unfavorable currency impacts related to the
movement of the dollar against the euro, and additional expenses related to the EDS acquisition. Each of our major segments experienced a year-over-year decrease in SG&A
expense as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal 2008.

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets

The
increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due primarily to amortization expenses related to the intangible assets purchased as
part of the EDS acquisition.

The
increase in amortization expense during fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007 was due primarily to amortization expenses related to the intangible assets purchased as part of the
EDS acquisition as well as other acquisitions made in fiscal 2008.

For
more information on our amortization of purchased intangibles assets, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by

Financial Statements in Item 8. In fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, we recorded IPR&D charges of $7 million, $45 million and $190 million, respectively, related to
acquisitions. The decrease in IPR&D in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due primarily to higher IPR&D expenses in the prior year as a result of our EDS acquisition in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2008.

Restructuring

Restructuring
charges for fiscal 2009 were $640 million. These charges included $346 million of severance and facility costs related to our
fiscal 2008 restructuring plan, $297 million of severance costs associated with our fiscal 2009 restructuring plan, and a reduction of $3 million related to adjustments to other
restructuring plans.

Restructuring
charges for fiscal 2008 were $270 million, which included $246 million of charges due primarily to severance and facility costs related to the EDS acquisition
and a net charge of $24 million relating to adjustments for existing restructuring programs.

Restructuring
charges for fiscal 2007 were $387 million, which included $354 million of expenses related to severance and other benefit costs associated with those
employees who elected to participate in the early retirement program implemented in fiscal 2007 and a net charge of $33 million relating to adjustments to our previous restructuring programs.

For
more information on our restructuring charges, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Workforce Rebalancing

As
part of our ongoing business operations, we incurred workforce rebalancing charges for severance and related costs within certain business segments in
fiscal 2009. Workforce rebalancing activities are considered part of normal operations as we continue to optimize our cost structure. Workforce rebalancing costs are included in our business segment
results, and we expect to incur additional workforce rebalancing costs in the future.

Acquisition-related Charges

We
recorded acquisition-related charges of $242 million and $41 million in fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008, respectively, related primarily to
consulting and integration costs as well as retention bonuses associated with the EDS acquisition. The increase in the acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to our acquisition
of EDS in August 2008.

Pension Curtailments and Pension Settlements, Net

In
fiscal 2007, we recognized a net gain on pension curtailments and settlements of $517 million, relating primarily to a $542 million
curtailment gain associated with a modification to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and post-retirement benefit plan. This curtailment gain was offset partially by net settlement
losses related to our other pension plan design changes.

For
more information on our retirement and post-retirement benefit plans, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

Interest and Other, Net

Interest and other, net decreased by $721 million in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease was driven primarily
by higher interest expenses due to higher average debt balances principally related to the EDS acquisition, lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates, and higher currency losses on
balance sheet remeasurement items. Additionally, there were higher gains from the sale of real estate in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2009.

Interest
and other, net decreased by $458 million in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease resulted primarily from currency losses on balance sheet remeasurement
items and lower interest income as a result of lower interest rates, the effect of which was partially offset by lower interest expense. Additionally, the prior-year period benefited from
higher gains from the sale of real estate.

Provision for Taxes

Our effective tax rates were 18.6%, 20.5% and 20.8% in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. HP's effective tax rate
generally differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due to favorable tax rates associated with some earnings from HP's operations in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world.
HP has not provided U.S. taxes for all of such earnings because HP plans to reinvest some of those earnings indefinitely outside the United States.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Continued)

The
decrease in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due primarily to the net income tax benefits recorded for fiscal 2009 which were related to foreign net operating
losses, adjustments to estimated fiscal 2008 tax accruals upon filing the 2008 income tax returns, valuation allowance reversals for state and foreign net operating losses, and other miscellaneous
items.

The
decrease in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was related in part to lower tax rates in other jurisdictions.

For
a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our provision for taxes, see Note 14 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Segment Information

A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each segment can be found in Note 19 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. We have realigned segment financial data for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2008 and 2007 to
reflect changes in HP's organizational structure that occurred at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We describe these changes more fully in Note 19. We have presented the
business segments in this Annual Report on Form 10-K based on the distinct nature of various businesses such as customer base, homogeneity of products and technology. The
discussions below include the results of each of our segments.

HP Enterprise Business

Services, ESS and HP Software are reported collectively as a broader HP Enterprise Business. We describe the results of the business
segments of the HP Enterprise Business in more detail below.

Services

As a result of the acquisition of EDS, we renamed our services segment and reorganized the business units within that segment to better
align them to our enhanced services portfolio. The business reorganization resulted in three new business units: application services, infrastructure technology outsourcing and business process
outsourcing. As part of this reorganization, the businesses included in the former HP consulting and integration business unit were divided among the application services and technology services
business units and the HP Software segment. In addition, the businesses included in the former outsourcing services business unit were divided among the infrastructure technology outsourcing and
business process outsourcing business units. Further, the managed print services offering under technology services was moved to IPG.

Services
net revenue increased 65.4% (71.6% when adjusted for currency) for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in revenues is due primarily to the acquisition of EDS
on August 26, 2008. Services net revenue for fiscal 2009 includes revenue from infrastructure technology outsourcing, technology services, application services and business process outsourcing,
which accounted for approximately 46%, 28%, 17% and 9% of revenues, respectively. Net revenue in infrastructure technology outsourcing, application services and business process outsourcing increased
due to the EDS acquisition. The net revenue increase in infrastructure technology outsourcing, application services, and business process outsourcing was partially offset by unfavorable currency
impacts and a decline in spending from existing customers not being offset with new growth due to slowing demand in the current economic environment. Application services and business process
outsourcing were impacted to a greater degree than infrastructure technology outsourcing. Net revenue in technology services declined due primarily to unfavorable currency impacts and weak economic
conditions, the effect of which was partially offset by growth in extended warranty.

Services
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 2.5 percentage points for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. The operating margin increased due
primarily to a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. There was also an increase in gross margin for fiscal 2009. Operating expense declined as a result of a continued focus on
cost structure improvements from overall cost controls. The gross margin in our Services segment increased for fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due primarily to the continued focus on cost structure
improvements, including delivery efficiencies and cost controls in our technology services business, and EDS-related acquisition synergies. This was partially offset by the mix effect from the
acquisition of the EDS business, which has lower gross margins.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Services
net revenue (including EDS results from August 26, 2008) increased 36.8% (30.0% when adjusted for currency) for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Net revenue
increased from the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of EDS. Services net revenue (excluding EDS results from August 26, 2008) increased 11.7% (4.8% when adjusted for currency) for
fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. Services net revenue (including EDS results from August 26, 2008) for fiscal 2008 includes revenue from technology services, infrastructure technology
outsourcing, application services and business process outsourcing, which accounted for approximately 49%, 36%, 12% and 3% of revenues, respectively. Net revenue in technology services increased in
fiscal 2008 from the prior year due primarily to growth in IT solution support services, extended warranty revenue and favorable currency impacts, the impact of which was partially offset by
competitive pricing pressures. Net revenue in infrastructure technology outsourcing, application services and business process outsourcing increased driven mainly by the EDS acquisition, an increase
in volume, favorable currency impacts and new business.

Services
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue (including EDS results from August 26, 2008) increased by 0.4 percentage points for fiscal 2008, as
compared to fiscal 2007. The operating margin increase was the result of a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue, partially offset by a slight decrease in gross margin. The
gross margin decrease in fiscal 2008 was due primarily to the impact of the continued competitive pricing environment, which was partially offset by the continued focus on cost structure improvements
generated by delivery efficiencies and cost controls. In fiscal 2008, continued efficiency improvements in our operating expense structure contributed to the decline in operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenue compared to the prior year.

Combined Segment Results

The combined segment results below refer to the results of our services business for fiscal 2008, which include the results of EDS from
the acquisition date, combined with the EDS results for the nine months ended June 30, 2008 and the period from August 1, 2008 to the acquisition date. The combined segment results are
presented for informational purposes only and are not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved had the businesses been operated together during that period.

Services
net revenue decreased 11.5% (3.8% when adjusted for currency) for fiscal 2009, as compared to the fiscal 2008 combined segment results presented in the table above. Services net
revenue for the prior period combined segment results includes revenue from infrastructure technology outsourcing, technology services, application services and business process outsourcing, which
accounted for approximately 46%, 26%, 19% and 9% of revenues, respectively. The net revenue declines were due primarily to an unfavorable currency impact, deferred revenue write-down
resulting from purchase accounting, and lower add-on business due to the slowing economic environment. Further, Services net revenue for fiscal 2009 as compared to the combined segment
results for fiscal 2008 reflects a weighted net revenue decline in the infrastructure technology outsourcing, business process outsourcing, technology services and application services units of 5.0%,
3.9%, 1.3% and 1.3%, respectively.

Services
earnings from operations as a percentage of net segment revenue increased 6.3 percentage points for fiscal 2009, as compared to the fiscal 2008 combined segment results.
Operating margin increased as a result of an increase in gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Gross margin increased due primarily to the continued focus
on cost structure improvements, including delivery efficiencies and cost controls, and acquisition synergies. The continued improvements in our operating expense structure contributed to the decline
in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue compared to fiscal 2008.

environment. ISS net revenue declined 20% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due to declines in unit volume. ISS average unit prices declined in fiscal 2009 while improving in the second half
of fiscal 2009 as a result of a new product ramp up. Total ESS blades revenue declined by 8% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Business critical systems net revenue decreased 27% in fiscal
2009 compared to fiscal 2008 driven by a decline in Integrity server revenue due to weaker market conditions and by the planned phase-out of the PA-RISC and Alpha Server
product lines. Storage net revenue declined 17% in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to a decline in disk and tape products as a result of a

weaker
demand environment, the effects of which were partially offset by revenue resulting from the acquisition of Lefthand Networks, which was completed in the first quarter of fiscal 2009.

In
fiscal 2009, ESS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 3.4 percentage points compared to fiscal 2008, due primarily to a decline in gross margin.
Gross margin in fiscal 2009 decreased due primarily to competitive pricing across each of the segment business units and product mix shifts. Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal
2009 was generally consistent with the fiscal 2008.

ESS
net revenue increased 4.1% (decreased 0.5% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007. Storage net revenue increased 13% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, with
strong performance in mid-range EVA, entry MSA, tape media and storage software. Industry standard servers net revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 as a result of growth
in blade revenue and unit volumes. Revenue growth in the industry standard servers business was partially offset by the decline in average unit prices driven by market movement to low-end
product lines and component cost declines. Business critical systems net revenue growth was flat in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. Integrity servers net revenue grew 22% in fiscal 2008 and
represents 79% of the business critical systems revenue mix, up from 64% in fiscal 2007. The increase was offset by revenue declines in the PA-RISC product line and the planned
phase-out of our Alpha Server product line. Integrity servers revenue in fiscal 2008 also included revenue from Montvale-based Integrity servers.

In
fiscal 2008, ESS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.8 percentage points compared to fiscal 2007, due primarily to a decrease in operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Gross margin increased slightly in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due primarily to cost management and improved attach rates in industry standard servers,
the effect of which was mostly offset by competitive pricing in storage and industry standard servers and a mix shift to entry level integrity servers. The decrease in operating expense as a
percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 was due primarily to continued cost structure improvements.

licenses and services declined, the effect of which was partially offset by increased support revenue as a result of renewal rate increases. Net revenue from BTO decreased 15% in fiscal 2009 as
compared to fiscal 2008. Net revenue from other software decreased 17% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, due to declines in revenues for communication and media solutions, business
intelligence solutions and information management.

HP
Software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 7.3 percentage points in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The operating margin improvement
in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to increased gross margin coupled with decreased operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from
a favorable support and services revenue mix and improved services margins, the effect of which was partially offset by an unfavorable license revenue mix. The decrease in operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to continued cost controls.

HP
Software net revenue increased 16.3% (10.4% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007. Net revenue from BTO increased 23% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007.
BTO net revenue growth in fiscal 2008 was driven by increases in support, higher license revenue due in part to the Opsware acquisition, and increases in services contracts. Net revenue from other
software increased by 6% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The growth in other software net revenue in fiscal
2008 was attributable primarily to the growth in the information management business due in part to our acquisition of Tower Software in May 2008 and increases in services from business intelligence
solutions, the effect of which was partially offset by a net revenue decline in communication and media solutions resulting from a competitive environment following network equipment provider industry
consolidation and the transfer of some hardware revenues to ESS due to a platform shift.

HP
Software earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 5.0 percentage points in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The operating margin increase in
fiscal 2008 was the result of a combination of an increase in gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The increase in gross margin in fiscal 2008 was due
primarily to cost savings in the BTO business, cost structure improvements as a result of increased scale in the information management business and, to a lesser extent, a favorable change in the
revenue mix driven by higher revenues from the BTO business, which typically has higher gross margins than the remainder of the segment. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net
revenue in fiscal 2008 was due primarily to continued cost controls, the effect of which was partially offset by increased field selling costs driven by sales force investments.

PSG
net revenue decreased 16.5% (11.6% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008. The revenue decline was primarily the result of the overall slowdown in the global
economy. Despite the overall regional declines, revenue in China increased for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. PSG net revenue decreased across all businesses in fiscal 2009. Unit volume
increased slightly in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008, as an increase in notebook PC volume was offset by a decline in desktop PCs, workstations, and handheld devices. The unit volume increase
in notebook PCs was due in part to growth of the HP and Compaq mini notebooks. In fiscal 2009, net revenue for notebook PCs decreased 11%, while net revenue for desktop PCs decreased 23% from fiscal
2008. Workstations and handheld revenues declined 33% and 52%, respectively, in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2009, net revenue for consumer clients decreased 14%, while net revenue for
commercial clients decreased 19% from fiscal 2008. The net revenue increase in Other PSG was related primarily to increased sales of extended warranties, support services and third-party branded
options. In fiscal 2009, PSG net revenue was also impacted by ASP declines. ASPs in consumer clients declined 21%, while ASPs in commercial clients declined 16%. ASPs declined from fiscal 2008 due
primarily to a competitive pricing environment, component cost reductions and the impact of currency combined with a mix shift toward
lower-end models. The ASP decline in fiscal 2009 was offset slightly by an increase in the option and monitor attach rates.

PSG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.9 percentage points in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008. The decrease was due primarily to a gross margin
decline resulting from ASPs declining at a faster pace than component costs combined with a mix shift toward lower-end products, the effects of which were partially offset by lower
warranty and supply chain costs and improvements in the option attach rate. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2009 was the result of effective cost controls.

PSG
net revenue increased 16.2% (10.8% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007. Unit volumes increased by 22% in fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The unit
volume increase was the result of strong growth in notebooks, with continued strength in emerging markets. In fiscal 2008, net revenue for notebook PCs increased 28% while net revenue for desktop PCs
increased 5% from fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, net revenue for consumer clients increased 19%, while net revenue for commercial clients increased 15% from fiscal 2007. The net revenue increase in
Other PSG in fiscal 2008 was related primarily to increased sales of third-party branded options and extended warranties. The revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in handhelds revenue
driven by product transition within converged devices. In fiscal 2008, the positive revenue impact from the PSG unit volume increase compared to fiscal 2007 was also moderated by a 7% decline in
commercial client ASPs and a

4%
decline in consumer client ASPs. ASPs declined from fiscal 2007 as a result of price erosion related to component cost reductions and a competitive pricing environment, the effect of which was
partially offset by an increased notebook mix and improved attach rates for monitors and other options.

PSG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.3 percentage points in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 as a result of a decrease in operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenue combined with a flat gross margin. Gross margin performance was a result of declining ASPs offset by an increase in the attach rate of higher-margin options. The operating
expense decline as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 was the result primarily of the increased net revenue and continued efforts to improve our cost structure through efficiency measures.

net revenue decreased 18.9% (16.5% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008, reflecting the impact of the global economic slowdown. Net revenue for commercial
hardware declined 36% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The net revenue decline in commercial hardware was driven by a unit volume decline of 38% in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008, due
primarily to worldwide market weaknesses impacting both our laser and our graphics businesses. Supplies net revenue declined 11% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The supplies net revenue
decline in fiscal 2009 was across all platforms and was the result of reductions in channel inventory and unfavorable currency impacts, the effect of which was partially moderated by supplies pricing.
Net revenue for consumer hardware declined 27% in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. The net revenue decline in consumer hardware was driven by a unit volume decline of 24% in fiscal 2009 from

IPG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 2.6 percentage points in fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008. Operating margin improvement in fiscal 2009
was a combination of an increase in gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The improvement in gross margin in fiscal 2009 resulted primarily from an increase
in the supplies mix and supplies pricing, the effect of which was partially offset by hardware margin declines due to

unfavorable
currency impacts and declines in average revenue per unit. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2009 was due primarily to effective cost controls.

IPG
net revenue increased 3.5% (decreased 0.8% when adjusted for currency) in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007. The growth in printer supplies net revenue in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007
reflected higher unit volumes of supplies as a result of the strong performance of color-related products. The slight increase in commercial hardware net revenue in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was
due mainly to unit volume growth in multifunction printers, color laser printers and large format printing products and revenue from recent acquisitions, partially offset by continued competitive
pricing pressures. The decrease in consumer hardware net revenue in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was due primarily to discontinued sales of cameras, competitive pricing pressures and lower unit
volumes of consumer hardware as a result of slower growth in the overall consumer printer market. Both consumer and commercial hardware were impacted by the continued shift in demand to lower-priced
products and a slowing economy, which caused average revenue per unit in each category to decline.

earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.4 percentage points in fiscal 2008 from the prior fiscal year. The operating margin improvement in
fiscal 2008 was due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. In fiscal 2008, the gross margin remained flat driven by improved margins for supplies as a result of product mix, the
effect of which was offset by unfavorable hardware margins. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2008 was due primarily to higher revenue and continued cost
controls, the effect of which was partially offset by increased investments in our enterprise printing sales force.

net revenue decreased by 0.9% in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008. The net revenue decrease was due to unfavorable currency movements. On a constant currency basis, fiscal 2009 net
revenue increased due primarily to portfolio growth, increased operating lease mix and higher buyout activities, the effect of which was partially offset by lower levels of remarketing and
end-of-lease activity.

HPFS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.6 percentage points in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 due primarily to a decrease in operating expenses,
the effect of which was partially offset by a decline in gross margin. The operating expense decrease was due to continued cost controls. The decline in gross margin was driven by an unfavorable
currency impact, lower margins relating to end of lease activity, higher bad debt expenses, and lower remarketing and buyout margins, the effect of which was partially offset by higher portfolio
margins.

HPFS
net revenue increased by 15.5% in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007. The net revenue increase was due primarily to a shift towards operating leases from financing leases in the overall
portfolio asset mix, higher average portfolio assets during the year, higher end-of-lease activity and a favorable currency impact.

HPFS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.5 percentage points in fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 due primarily to a decrease in operating expenses
as a percentage of net revenue and increased margin on end-of lease activity, the effect of which was offset by higher bad debt expenses and lower portfolio margins due to higher operating
leases in the portfolio asset mix. The operating expense decrease as a percentage of revenue is driven by a higher rate of increase in revenues relative to operating expenses due to higher operating
lease mix of the portfolio and continued cost controls.

Portfolio Assets and Ratios

HPFS maintains a strategy to generate a competitive return on equity by effectively leveraging its portfolio against the risks
associated with interest rates and credit. The HPFS business model is asset-intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies, including
a segment balance sheet that is derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive these amounts are substantially the same as those used by the consolidated
company. However, certain intercompany loans and accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheet for HPFS were as follows for the following fiscal years ended October 31:

Net
revenue in Corporate Investments relates primarily to network infrastructure products sold under the brand "ProCurve Networking." In fiscal 2009, revenue from network infrastructure
products decreased 19.6% as compared to fiscal 2008, resulting from the slowdown in the networking market and a resulting decrease in sales of enterprise ethernet switch products. Partially offsetting
the revenue decline was revenue resulting from the acquisition of Colubris Networks, Inc. ("Colubris"), which HP acquired in October 2008.

Corporate
Investments reported a loss from operations in fiscal 2009 as compared to the positive earnings from operations reported in fiscal 2008 due primarily to lower earnings from
operations generated by network infrastructure products. Gross margin in Corporate Investments declined for fiscal 2009 as the result of a unit volume decline in the sale of network infrastructure
products and

competitive
pricing pressure. The loss from operations in Corporate Investments was also impacted by expenses carried in the segment associated with corporate development, global alliances and HP
Labs, which declined from fiscal 2008.

In
fiscal 2008, the majority of the net revenue in Corporate Investments related to network infrastructure products sold under the brand "ProCurve Networking," which grew 26.2% from
fiscal 2007 as the result of continued increased sales of enterprise class gigabit and 10 gigabit Ethernet switch products. Fiscal 2008 network infrastructure revenue included a small amount of
revenue from Colubris.

Corporate
Investments reported earnings from operations in fiscal 2008 as compared to losses in fiscal 2007 due primarily to increased earnings from operations generated by network
infrastructure products, and operating expenses related to HP Labs was flat as compared to fiscal 2007.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the United States.
Most of the amounts held outside of the United States could be repatriated to the United States but, under current law, would be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign
tax credits. Repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. We have provided for the United States federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes, except
for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Repatriation could result in additional United States federal income tax payments in future years. Where
local restrictions prevent an efficient intercompany transfer of funds, our intent is that cash balances would remain outside of the United States and we would meet United States liquidity needs
through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in
which it is needed.

The
information discussed below is presented based on our historical results, which include the results of EDS for the period following the August 26, 2008 closing date of the
acquisition.

LIQUIDITY

We use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity; we believe that internally generated cash flows are generally
sufficient to support business operations, capital expenditures and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to a level of discretionary investments and share repurchases. We are able to
supplement this near-term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities made available by various foreign and domestic financial

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by approximately $1.2 billion for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008.
The decrease was due primarily to increased utilization of cash resources for payment of operating liabilities such as accounts payable, other current liabilities and restructuring along with a
decrease in net earnings, the impact of which was partially offset by the increased generation of cash resources through the utilization of operating assets such as inventory and other current assets
along with increased amortization expense. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $5.0 billion for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase was due
primarily to higher net earnings in fiscal 2008, a decrease in accounts and financing receivables, and increased accounts payable.

Cash conversion cycle

Beginning
in the second quarter of fiscal 2009, we reclassified certain activity within Other accrued liabilities to Accounts payable as this
better represents the nature of the activity. All prior periods have been revised to conform to the current presentation.

Days
of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing ending accounts receivable,
net of allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average net revenue. Our accounts receivable balance was $13.4 billion as of October 31, 2007.

Days
of supply in inventory ("DOS") measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing ending inventory by a 90-day
average cost of goods sold. Our inventory balance was $8.0 billion as of October 31, 2007.

Days
of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("DPO") measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing ending accounts
payable by a 90-day average cost of goods sold. Our accounts payable balance was $12.4 billion as of October 31, 2007.

Our
working capital requirements depend upon our effective management of the cash conversion cycle, which represents effectively the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for
the purchase of raw materials to the collection of cash from our customers. The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO.

The
cash conversion cycle for fiscal 2009 decreased by 6 days as compared to fiscal 2008. The increase in DSO was due primarily to our improving penetration into the enterprise
market which tends to have a higher DSO profile, optimizing terms to drive shareholder value as well as more sales in the month of October. The decrease in DOS was due to lower inventory levels driven
primarily by improved inventory management. The increase in DPO was due primarily to a change in purchasing linearity in the fourth quarter.

The
cash conversion cycle for the fiscal 2008 decreased by 4 days as compared to fiscal 2007. The increase in DSO was due primarily to a higher accounts receivable balance during
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008 compared to the same period in fiscal 2007 and the effect of the EDS acquisition. The decrease in DOS was due primarily to more efficient inventory management, higher
cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter of 2008 as a result of increased revenues and the effect of the EDS acquisition. The slight decrease in DPO was due to the effect of the EDS acquisition.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately $10.1 billion for fiscal 2009 as compared to fiscal 2008 due
primarily to higher cash payments made in connection with fiscal 2008



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

acquisitions
and increased by approximately $4.6 billion for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007 due to fiscal 2008 acquisition activity.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities increased by approximately $4.7 billion for fiscal 2009, as compared to fiscal 2008. The
increase was due primarily to higher net repayments of commercial paper and debt, the impact of which was partially offset by decreased repurchases of our common stock. Net cash used in financing
activities decreased by approximately $3.6 billion for fiscal 2008, as compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease was due primarily to higher net issuance of commercial paper and debt.

We
maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including
acquisitions), share repurchase activities, overall cost of capital, and targeted capital structure.

In
fiscal 2009 short-term debt decreased by $8.3 billion and long-term debt increased by $6.3 billion as compared to fiscal 2008. This was primarily
due to the replacement of short-term debt with long-term debt as capital market conditions improved from last year, which was partially offset by a reclassification of
$1 billion from long-term to short-term. Short-term debt and long-term debt increased by $7.0 billion and $2.7 billion
respectively, for fiscal 2008 as compared to fiscal 2007. The net increase in total debt is due mainly to commercial paper issued in conjunction with the EDS acquisition.

Our
debt-equity ratio is calculated as the carrying value of debt divided by the carrying value of equity. Our debt-equity ratio decreased by 0.07x in fiscal
2009, due primarily to the net repayment of $2.0 billion debt. It increased by 0.25x in fiscal 2008 due primarily to funding the EDS acquisition by debt.

Our
weighted-average interest rate reflects the average effective rate on our borrowings prevailing during the year; it factors in the impact of swapping some of our global notes with
fixed interest rates for global notes with floating interest rates. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which
is incorporated herein by reference. The slightly lower weighted average interest rates over the past three years is a result of the combination of lower market interest rates and swapping some of our
fixed interest obligations

with some of our fixed global notes for variable rate obligations through interest rate swaps in a declining rates environment.

Our
commercial paper programs are supported by various credit facilities, including a $3.5 billion credit facility expiring in February
2010 and a $2.9 billion credit facility expiring in May 2012. Our ability to have a U.S. commercial paper outstanding balance that exceeds the $6.4 billion supported by our credit
facilities is subject to a number of factors, including liquidity conditions and business performance. HP also has registered for the Commercial Paper Funding Facility ("CPFF") provided by the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York, which would enable HP to issue three-month unsecured commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle of the Federal Reserve. The maximum amount of commercial paper that HP
may issue at any time through this program is $10.4 billion less the total principal amount of all other outstanding commercial paper that HP has issued. The CPFF program is currently scheduled
to expire on February 1, 2010. As of October 31, 2009, HP had not issued any commercial paper under the CPFF program. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which
is incorporated herein by reference, for additional information about these credit facilities and the CPFF program.

In
addition to the above, at October 31, 2009, we had approximately $1.3 billion of recorded liabilities and related interest and penalties pertaining to
uncertainty in income tax positions, which will be partially offset by $58 million of deferred tax assets and interest receivable. These liabilities and related interest and penalties include
$19 million expected to be paid within one year. For the remaining amount, we are unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the
uncertainties related to these tax matters. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional information on
taxes.

Funding Commitments

In fiscal 2010, we expect to contribute approximately $820 million to our pension and post-retirement plan
funding. Our funding policy is to contribute cash to our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding and taxing
authorities. Funding for the years following 2010 would be based on the then current market conditions, actuarial estimates and plan funding status. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial
Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference, for additional information on pension activity.

As
a result of our approved restructuring plans, we expect future cash expenditures of approximately $1.9 billion. We expect to make cash payments of approximately
$1.1 billion in fiscal 2010 and the majority of the remaining amount through 2012. See Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by
reference, for additional information on restructuring activities.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we have not participated in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated
entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities ("SPEs"), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating
off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of October 31, 2009, we are not involved in any material unconsolidated SPEs.



ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and equity price risks that could
impact our financial position and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use
derivative contracts only to manage existing underlying exposures of HP. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity
analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below.

Actual
gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and
equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and
assets, liabilities and debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to our operations for
fiscal 2009 were the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely
affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures taken alone. We use a
combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent,
cost of sales and inter-company lease loan denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign
currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as
hedging instruments consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. For these types of derivatives and hedges we recognize the gains and losses on these
foreign currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency-denominated exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the foreign
currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures, primarily if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the
currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2009 and 2008, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset
by the underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2009 and 2008. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a
hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of $106 million and $141 million at October 31, 2009 and
October 31, 2008, respectively.

Interest rate risk

We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables. We issue
long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. We then typically use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the
market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for



floating
interest payments. However, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of
fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. In order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest
returns into variable interest returns. We may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based interest income received on certain variable-rate investments. We may also enter
into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2009 and 2008, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investment instruments, financing receivables and
interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual maturities for the debt, investments and interest rate swaps and approximate maturities for financing receivables. The discount rates we used were based on
the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2009 and 2008. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the
fair values of our debt, investment instruments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swap positions, of $33 million at October 31, 2009 and $9 million at
October 31, 2008.

Equity price risk

We are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities, which had an estimated fair
value of $5 million at October 31, 2009 and $5 million at October 31, 2008. We monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis. Generally, we do not
attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities. However, we may use derivative transactions to hedge certain positions from time to time. We do not purchase our equity
securities with the intent to use them for speculative purposes. A hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly-traded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair
values of our marketable equity securities of $1 million at October 31, 2009 and $2 million at
October 31, 2008. The aggregate cost of privately-held companies, marketable trading securities and other investments was $142 million at October 31, 2009 and
$425 million at October 31, 2008.

Quarterly Summary




Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett-Packard Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2009
and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2009. Our audits also included the
financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the
Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries at
October 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year 2009, Hewlett-Packard Company changed its method of accounting for revenue recognition with the
adoption of amendments to the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") resulting from Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13,

Multiple-Deliverable Revenue
Arrangements

, and Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-14,

Certain Revenue
Arrangements That Include Software Elements

, both adopted effective November 1, 2008 and its method of accounting for the measurement date provisions for its defined
benefit postretirement plans in accordance with the guidance provided in FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans—An Amendment of FASB No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

(codified primarily in FASB ASC Topic 715,

Compensation—Retirement Benefits

). In fiscal year
2008, Hewlett-Packard Company changed its method of accounting for income taxes in
accordance with the guidance provided in FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement
No. 109

(codified primarily in FASB ASC Topic 740,

Income Taxes

). In fiscal year 2007, Hewlett-Packard Company changed
its method of accounting for defined benefit postretirement plans in accordance with the guidance provided in FASB Statement No. 158,

Employers' Accounting for Defined
Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—An Amendment of FASB No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)

(codified primarily in FASB ASC Topic 715,

Compensation—Retirement Benefits

).

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Hewlett-Packard Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of October 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission and our report dated December 17, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett-Packard Company

We have audited Hewlett-Packard Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2009, based on criteria
established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Hewlett-Packard Company's management is
responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying
Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other
procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Hewlett-Packard Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2009, based on the COSO
criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard
Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 2009, and our report dated December 17, 2009, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

HP's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for HP. HP's
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. HP's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of HP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of HP are being made only in
accordance with authorizations of management and directors of HP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
disposition of HP's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

HP's
management assessed the effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2009, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on the assessment by HP's management, we determined that HP's internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of October 31, 2009. The effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2009 has been audited by Ernst &
Young LLP, HP's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 78 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Hewlett-Packard Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its controlled
majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, "HP"). HP accounts for equity investments in companies over which HP has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not hold a controlling
interest, under the equity method, and HP records its proportionate share of income or losses in interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. HP has eliminated all significant
intercompany accounts and transactions.

Business Combinations

HP has recorded all acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, has included the results of operations of
acquired businesses in HP's consolidated results from the date of each acquisition. HP allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets
acquired, including in-process research and development ("IPR&D") charges, based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill.
The fair value assigned to assets acquired is based on valuations using management's estimates and assumptions.

HP
will adopt new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") for business combinations in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Changes to the purchase
method of accounting for business combinations are discussed further in

Accounting Pronouncements

in this Note.

Reclassifications and Segment Reorganization

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior-year amounts in order to conform to current year presentation.

HP
has made certain organizational realignments in order to optimize its operating structure. Reclassifications of prior year financial information have been made to conform to the
current year presentation. None of the changes impacts HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share. See Note 19 for a further
discussion of HP's segment reorganization, which is incorporated herein by reference.

HP
has made certain reclassifications of its Consolidated Statements of Earnings for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007 to provide improved
visibility and comparability with the current year presentation. This change does not affect previously reported results of operations for any period presented. Certain pursuit-related costs
previously reported as cost of services have been realigned retroactively to selling, general and administrative expenses due to organizational realignments.

HP
has revised the presentation of its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2007 to reflect revisions to the
current and deferred tax provisions in those years related to the presentation of tax benefits of stock option plans, as described in Note 14. The revisions result in an increase in the change
in taxes on earnings and a decrease in the
adjustment to deferred taxes on earnings within cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These revisions do not affect previously reported results of
operations, financial position or net cash provided by operating activities for any period presented.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in HP's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Net revenue is derived primarily from the sale of products and services. The following revenue recognition policies define the manner
in which HP accounts for sales transactions.

HP
recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally, HP recognizes hardware revenue on sales to channel partners, including resellers, distributors or value-added solution providers at the time of sale
and when the channel partners have economic substance apart from HP and HP has completed its obligations related to the sale.

In
October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2009-13, "Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements" ("ASU 2009-13"). The new standard changes
the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the
relative selling price. Concurrently to issuing ASU 2009-13, the FASB also issued ASU No. 2009-14, "Certain Revenue Arrangements That Include Software Elements" ("ASU
2009-14"). ASU 2009-14 excludes software that is contained on a tangible
product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible product's functionality.

HP
early adopted these standards as of the beginning of fiscal 2009 for new and materially modified deals originating after November 1, 2008; therefore, the previously reported
quarterly results have been restated to reflect the impact of adoption. As a result of the adoption, fiscal 2009 net revenues and net earnings were higher by $255 million and
$55 million, respectively. The impact was due to the recognition of revenue previously deferred for certain deliverables bundled in multiple element arrangements where the arrangements also
included services for which HP was unable to demonstrate fair value pursuant to the previous standards. The new standards allow for deliverables for which revenue was previously deferred to be
separated and recognized as delivered, rather than over the longest service delivery period as a single unit with other elements in the arrangement. HP is not able to reasonably estimate the effect of
adopting these standards on future financial periods as the impact will vary based on the nature and volume of new or materially modified deals in any given period.

For
fiscal 2009 and future periods, pursuant to the guidance of ASU 2009-13, when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products,
licenses and/or services, HP allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") if
available, third party evidence ("TPE") if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price ("ESP") if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. In multiple element arrangements where
more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

deliverables
and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. If the
arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the
guidance for recognizing software revenue, as amended.

HP
limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations or
subject to customer-specified return or refund privileges.

HP
evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether they represent separate units of accounting. A deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has
standalone value and there are no customer-negotiated refund or return rights for the delivered elements. If the arrangement includes a customer-negotiated refund or return right relative to the
delivered item and the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in HP's control, the delivered element constitutes a separate unit of accounting. In
instances when the aforementioned criteria are not met, the deliverable is combined with the undelivered elements and the allocation of the arrangement consideration and revenue recognition is
determined for the combined unit as a single
unit. Allocation of the consideration is determined at arrangement inception on the basis of each unit's relative selling price.

HP
establishes VSOE of selling price using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately and, in rare instances, using the price established by management having the relevant
authority. TPE of selling price is established by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers. The best estimate
of selling price is established considering internal factors such as margin objectives, pricing practices and controls, customer segment pricing strategies and the product lifecycle. Consideration is
also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and industry technology lifecycles.

For
fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, pursuant to the previous guidance of revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, for a sales arrangement with multiple elements, HP allocated
revenue to each element based on its relative fair value, or for software, based on VSOE of fair value. In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, HP first allocated revenue to the fair
value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. Where the fair value for an undelivered element could not be determined, HP deferred revenue for the delivered
elements until the undelivered elements were delivered or the fair value was determinable for the remaining undelivered elements. If the revenue for a delivered item was not recognized because it was
not separable from the undelivered item, then HP also deferred the cost of the delivered item. HP limited the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that was not contingent
on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations or subject to customer-specified return or refund privileges. For the purposes of income statement classification of
products and services revenue, when HP could not determine fair value for all of the elements in an arrangement and the transaction was accounted for as a single unit of accounting, HP allocated
revenue to products and services based on a rational and consistent methodology. This methodology utilized external and internal pricing inputs to derive HP's best estimate of fair value for the
elements in the arrangement.

In
instances when revenue is derived from sales of third-party vendor services, revenue is recorded at gross when HP is a principal to the transaction and net of costs when HP is acting
as an agent

between
the customer and the vendor. Several factors are considered to determine whether HP is an agent or principal, most notably whether HP is the primary obligator to the customer, has established
its own pricing, and has inventory and credit risks.

HP
reports revenue net of any required taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities, with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to
the relevant government authority.

Products

Hardware

Under
HP's standard terms and conditions of sale, HP transfers title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is delivered to the customer and
revenue is recognized accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain. HP reduces revenue for estimated customer returns, price protection, rebates and other
programs offered under sales agreements established by HP with its distributors and resellers. HP records revenue from the sale of equipment under sales-type leases as product revenue at
the inception of the lease. HP accrues the estimated cost of post-sale obligations, including basic product warranties, based on historical experience at the time HP recognizes revenue.

Software

In
accordance with the specific guidance for recognizing software revenue, where applicable, HP recognizes revenue from perpetual software licenses at the
inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Term-based software license revenue is recognized on a subscription basis over the term of the
license entitlement. HP uses the residual method to allocate revenue to software licenses at the inception of the license term when VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements exists, such as
post-contract support, and all other revenue recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue generated from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates on a
when-and-if-available basis is recognized over the period such items are delivered.

Services

HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software
post-contract customer support agreements, ratably over the contract period and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as
incurred. For time and material contracts, HP recognizes revenue and costs as services are rendered. HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price consulting arrangements over the contract period on a
proportional performance basis, as determined by the relationship of actual labor costs incurred to date to the estimated total contract labor costs, with estimates regularly revised during the life
of the contract. HP recognizes revenue on certain design and build (design, development and/or construction of software and/or systems) projects using the
percentage-of-completion method. HP uses the cost to cost method of measurement towards completion as determined by the percentage of cost incurred to date to the total
estimated costs of the project. HP uses the completed contract method if reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Outsourcing
services revenue is generally recognized when the service is provided and the amount earned is not contingent upon any future event. If the service is provided evenly during
the contract term but service billings are uneven, revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term. HP recognizes revenue from operating leases on a
straight-line basis as service revenue over the rental period.

HP
recognizes costs associated with outsourcing contracts as incurred, unless such costs relate to the transition phase of the outsourcing contract, in which case HP defers and
subsequently amortizes these set-up costs over the contractual services period. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining original term
unless billing patterns indicate a more accelerated method is appropriate. Based on actual and projected contract financial performance indicators, the recoverability of deferred contract costs
associated with a particular contract is analyzed on a periodic basis using the undiscounted estimated cash flows of the whole contract over its remaining contract term. If such undiscounted cash
flows are insufficient to recover the long-lived assets and deferred contract costs, the deferred contract costs are written down based on a discounted cash flow model. If a cash flow
deficiency remains after reducing the balance of the deferred contract costs to zero, any remaining long-lived assets related to that contract are evaluated for impairment.

HP
recognizes losses on consulting and outsourcing arrangements in the period that the contractual loss becomes probable and estimable. HP records amounts invoiced to customers in excess
of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. HP records revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on fixed-price contracts as
trade receivables.

Financing Income

Sales-type and direct-financing leases produce financing income, which HP recognizes at consistent rates of return over the
lease term.

Shipping and Handling

HP includes costs related to shipping and handling in cost of sales for all periods presented.

Advertising

HP expenses advertising costs as incurred or when the advertising is first run. Such costs totaled approximately $0.7 billion in
fiscal 2009, $1.0 billion in fiscal 2008 and $1.1 billion in fiscal 2007.

Taxes on Earnings

HP recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. HP records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax
assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

HP classifies investments as cash equivalents if the original maturity of an investment is three months or less. Cash and cash
equivalents consist primarily of highly liquid investments in time deposits



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

held
in major banks and commercial paper. As of October 31, 2009 and 2008, the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short period of time to maturity.
Interest income was approximately $119 million in fiscal 2009, $401 million in fiscal 2008 and $598 million in fiscal 2007.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

HP establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade and financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectability.
HP maintains bad debt reserves based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, trends in overall weighted-average risk rating of the total portfolio,
macroeconomic conditions, significant one-time events, historical experience and the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities
based on market factors and the financial condition of customers. HP records a specific reserve for individual accounts when HP becomes aware of specific customer circumstances such as in the case of
bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, HP would further adjust estimates of the recoverability of
receivables.

Inventory

HP values inventory at the lower of cost or market, with cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis.
Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value are made, if required, for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances.

Property, Plant and Equipment

HP states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. HP capitalizes additions and improvements and expenses
maintenance and repairs as incurred. Depreciation is computed using straight-line or accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are 5 to
40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment. HP depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is
shorter. HP depreciates equipment held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value. The estimated useful lives of assets used solely to support a customer
services contract generally do not exceed the term of the customer contract.

HP
capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and
installation and testing of the software. HP amortizes capitalized internal use software costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally
from three to five years.

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least
annually. HP reviews goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually at the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For goodwill, HP performs a two-step impairment test. In the first step, HP compares the fair value of each
reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 19. HP determines the fair value of its reporting units based on a
weighting of



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

income
and market approaches. Under the income approach, HP calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, HP
estimates the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to
that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then HP
must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its
implied fair value, HP records an impairment loss equal to the difference.

The
fair value of the indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets is estimated and compared to the carrying value. HP estimates the fair value of these intangible assets using an income
approach. HP recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets is less than the carrying value.

HP
amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from one to ten years.

Long-Lived Asset Impairment

HP evaluates property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. HP assesses the recoverability of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flow the assets are expected to
generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any,
are less than the carrying value of the asset. When HP identifies an impairment, HP reduces the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or,
when available and appropriate, to comparable market values.

Software Development Costs

Costs incurred to acquire or develop software for resale may be capitalized subsequent to the software product establishing
technological feasibility. Capitalized software development costs are amortized using the greater of the straight-line amortization method or the ratio that current gross revenues for a
product bear to the total current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product. The estimated useful lives for capitalized software for resale are generally three years or less. Software
development costs incurred subsequent to a product establishing technological feasibility are usually not significant. In those instances, such costs are expensed as incurred.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

HP measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value based on the exchange price that would be received for an asset or
paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Financial instruments are
primarily comprised of time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate and other debt securities, equity securities and other investments in common stock and common stock equivalents
and derivatives. See Note 9 for a further discussion on fair value of financial instruments.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

Derivative Financial Instruments

HP uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and options, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate
exposures. HP also may use other derivative instruments not designated as hedges such as forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. HP does not use derivative financial
instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 10 for a full description of HP's derivative financial instrument activities and related accounting policies, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Investments

HP's investments consist principally of time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, corporate debt, other debt securities, and
equity securities of publicly-traded and privately-held companies.

HP
classifies its investments in debt securities and its equity investments in public companies as available-for-sale securities and carries them at fair value.
HP determines fair values for investments in public companies using quoted market prices and records a charge to Interest and other, net when the change in fair values is determined to be an
other-than-temporary
change. HP carries equity investments in privately-held companies at cost or at fair value when HP recognizes an other-than-temporary impairment charge.

HP
monitors its investment portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline
in value is determined to be an other-than-temporary decline and 1) HP does not intend to sell the debt security, and 2) when it is not more likely than not that HP will be required to
sell the debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, HP records an impairment charge to Interest and other, net in the amount of the credit loss and the balance, if any, to other
comprehensive income.

HP
determined the declines in value of certain investments to be other-than-temporary declines. Accordingly, HP recorded impairments of approximately $24 million in fiscal 2009,
$27 million in fiscal 2008 and $28 million in fiscal 2007. HP includes these impairments in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Depending on market and
other conditions, HP may record additional impairments on its investment portfolio in the future.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject HP to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash
equivalents, investments, accounts receivable from trade customers and from contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.

HP
maintains cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These
financial institutions are located in many different geographical regions and HP's policy is designed to limit exposure with any one institution. As part of its cash and risk management processes, HP
performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions. HP has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. HP utilizes
forward contracts and other derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty,
which could result in a material loss.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

HP
sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant receivable balances with these parties.
If the financial condition or operations of these distributors and resellers deteriorate substantially, HP's operating results could be adversely affected. The ten largest distributor and reseller
receivable balances collectively, which were concentrated primarily in North America and Europe, represented approximately 22% of gross accounts receivable at October 31, 2009 and 18% at
October 31, 2008. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable and financing receivables is generally diversified
due to the large number of entities comprising HP's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographical regions. HP performs ongoing credit evaluations of the
financial condition of its third-party distributors, resellers and other customers and requires collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. To ensure a
receivable balance is not overstated due to uncollectibility, an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained as required under U.S. GAAP. The past due or delinquency status of a receivable is based
on the contractual payment terms of the receivable. The need to write off a receivable balance depends on the age, size and a determination of collectability of the receivable. HP generally has
experienced longer accounts receivable collection cycles in its emerging markets, in particular Asia Pacific and Latin America, compared to its United States and European markets. In the event that
accounts receivable collection cycles in emerging markets significantly deteriorate or one or more of HP's larger resellers or enterprise customers fail, HP's operating results could be adversely
affected.

Other Concentration

HP obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality or other
considerations. The loss of a single source supplier, the deterioration of its relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which HP is
supplied components by a single source supplier could adversely affect HP's revenue and gross margins.

Stock-Based Compensation

Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted is determined based on the grant-date fair
value. HP recognizes these compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate, and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the share-based payment awards. HP estimated the forfeiture rate based on its historical experience for fiscal grant years
where the majority of the vesting terms have been satisfied.

Foreign Currency Transactions

HP uses the U.S. dollar predominately as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars
are remeasured into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities, and historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, cost of sales and
expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each new reporting period, and net revenue, cost of sales and expenses related to the previously reported periods are remeasured at
historical exchange rates. HP includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in net earnings. Certain foreign subsidiaries designate the local currency as their



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

functional
currency, and HP records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet dates as translation adjustments and includes them as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans

HP has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory retirement and post-retirement plans. In addition,
HP has assumed additional retirement and post-retirement plans in connection with its acquisition of Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS") in August 2008. HP generally amortizes
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service life of participants. The measurement date for all HP plans is October 31 for
fiscal 2009 and September 30 for fiscal 2008 except that the measurement date for EDS plans is October 31 for fiscal 2008. See Note 16 for a full description of these plans and
the accounting and funding policies, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Loss Contingencies

HP is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP records a
provision for a liability when it believes it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both
probability and the estimated amount. HP reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations,
settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond HP's control.

HP
evaluated all subsequent events that occurred after the balance sheet date and through the date and time its financial statements were issued on December 17, 2009.

Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to fair value measurements. The new standard defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued a new provision which delayed the effective date of the fair
value measurements and disclosures for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis (at least annually). In August 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2009-05, "Measuring Liabilities at Fair Value" in relation to the fair value
measurement of liabilities. HP adopted the applicable portions of the provisions of the new standards in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009, and will adopt the provision related to the
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. Although HP will continue to evaluate the application of the provision for the nonfinancial assets and
nonfinancial liabilities, HP does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. See Note 9 for additional information pertaining to fair value
measurements.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to business combinations. The new standard expands the definition of a business and a business combination; requires
recognition of assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognized in earnings; requires
acquisition-related expenses and



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

restructuring
costs to be recognized separately from the business combination and expensed as incurred; requires in-process research and development to be capitalized at fair value as an
indefinite-lived intangible asset; and requires that changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period be recognized
as a component of provision for taxes. The new standard also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. In April
2009, the FASB issued a new standard which clarified the accounting for pre-acquisition contingencies. HP will adopt these new business combination standards in the first quarter of fiscal
2010. The impact of adoption will be largely dependent on the size and nature of the business combinations completed after the adoption of this statement.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to noncontrolling interests. The new standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests
in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent's ownership interest,
and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. The new standard also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish
between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. HP will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. HP does not expect the adoption of
this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In
May 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to convertible debt instruments. The new standard requires the issuer of certain convertible debt instruments that may be
settled in cash (or other assets) on conversion to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion option) components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer's
non-convertible debt borrowing rate. HP will adopt this new accounting standard on a retrospective basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. HP does not expect the adoption of this
standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that clarifies whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions should be included in computing earnings per share.
Under the new standard, HP will be required to include restricted stock that contains non-forfeitable rights to dividends in its calculation of basic earnings per share ("EPS"), and will
need to calculate basic EPS using the "two-class method." The two-class method of computing EPS is an earnings allocation formula that determines EPS for each class of common
stock and participating securities according to dividends declared (or accumulated) and participation rights in undistributed earnings. HP will adopt this new accounting standard on a retrospective
basis in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. HP does not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on its calculation of basic EPS.

In
November 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to defensive intangible assets. Defensive intangible assets are acquired intangible assets that the acquirer does not
intend to actively use but intends to hold to prevent its competitors from obtaining access to them. Under the new standard, defensive intangible assets must be initially recognized at fair value and
amortized over the benefit period. HP will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. The impact of adoption will be largely dependent on the size and nature of business
combinations completed after the date of adoption.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)

In
December 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard that requires additional disclosures about assets held in an employer's defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan.
HP will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. HP will present the required disclosures in the prescribed format on a prospective basis upon adoption. This new
standard will only affect the notes to HP's consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to transfers of financial assets. It amends previous guidance to remove the concept of a qualifying special-purpose entity
and its exemption from consolidation in the transferor's financial statements. This new standard also establishes conditions for reporting a transfer of a portion of a financial asset as a sale,
modifies the financial-asset derecognition criteria, revises how interests retained by the transferor in a sale of financial assets are initially measured, removes the guaranteed mortgage
securitization recharacterization provisions, and requires additional disclosures. HP will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. HP does not expect the adoption of
this standard will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements.

In
June 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to the consolidation of variable interest entities. It eliminates the quantitative approach previously required for
determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and requires ongoing qualitative reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. This
new standard also requires additional disclosures about an enterprise's involvement in variable interest entities. HP will adopt this new accounting standard in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. HP is
currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, HP adopted the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles which only affected the
specific references to GAAP literature in the notes to HP's consolidated financial statements.

In
October 2009, the FASB issued ASU 2009-13. The new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement
and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative selling price. Concurrently to issuing ASU 2009-13, the FASB also issued ASU
2009-14. ASU 2009-14 excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible
product's functionality.

A
further discussion of the financial impact of ASU 2009-13 and ASU 2009-14 appears under "Revenue Recognition" above.

Note 2: Stock-Based Compensation

HP's stock-based compensation plans include incentive compensation plans and an employee stock purchase plan ("ESPP").

Stock-based Compensation Expense and the Related Income Tax Benefits

Total stock-based compensation expense before income taxes for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $635 million, $606 million
and $629 million, respectively. The resulting income tax benefit for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $199 million, $178 million and $182 million, respectively.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 2: Stock-Based Compensation (Continued)

Cash
received from option exercises and purchases under the ESPP in fiscal 2009 was $1.8 billion. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises of
the share-based payment awards in fiscal 2009 totaled $252 million. Cash received from option exercises and purchases under the ESPP in fiscal 2008 was $1.8 billion. The actual tax
benefit realized for the tax deduction from option exercises of the share-based payment awards in fiscal 2008 totaled $412 million.

Incentive Compensation Plans

HP's incentive compensation plans include principal option plans adopted in 2004, 2000, 1995 and 1990 ("principal option plans"), as
well as various stock option plans assumed through acquisitions under which stock-based awards are outstanding. Stock-based awards granted from the principal option plans include performance-based
restricted units ("PRUs"), stock options and restricted stock awards. Employees meeting certain employment qualifications were eligible to receive
stock-based awards in fiscal 2009. There were approximately 91,000 employees holding stock-based awards under one or more of the option plans as of October 31, 2009.

In
fiscal 2008, HP implemented a program that provides for the issuance of PRUs representing hypothetical shares of HP common stock that may be issued under the Hewlett-Packard Company
2004 Stock Incentive Plan. PRU awards may be granted to eligible employees, including HP's principal executive officer, principal financial officer and other executive officers. Each PRU award
reflects a target number of shares that may be issued to the award recipient. The actual number of shares the recipient receives is determined at the end of a three-year performance period
based on results achieved versus company performance goals. Those goals are based on HP's annual cash flow from operations as a percentage of revenue and average total shareholder return ("TSR")
relative to the S&P 500 over the performance period. Depending on HP's results during the three-year performance period, the actual number of shares that a grant recipient receives
at the end of the period may range from 0% to 200% of the targeted shares granted, based on the calculations described below.

Cash
flow performance goals are established at the beginning of each year. At the end of each year, a portion of the target number of shares may be credited in the award recipient's name
depending on the achievement of the cash flow performance goal for that year. The number of shares credited varies between 0% if performance is below the minimum level and 150% if performance is at or
above the maximum level. For performance between the minimum level and the maximum level, a proportionate percentage between 30% and 150% is applied based on relative performance between the minimum
and the maximum levels.

Following
the expiration of the three-year performance period, the number of shares credited to the award recipient during the performance period is adjusted by a TSR
modifier. The TSR modifier, which is determined at the beginning of each performance period, varies between 0%, if the minimum level is not met, resulting in no payout under the PRU award, and 133%,
if performance is at or above the maximum level. For performance between the minimum level and the maximum level, a proportionate TSR modifier between 66% and 133% is applied based on relative
performance between the minimum and the maximum levels. The number of shares, if any, received by the PRU award recipient equals the number of shares credited to the award recipient during the
performance period multiplied by the TSR modifier.

Recipients
of PRU awards generally must remain employed by HP on a continuous basis through the end of the applicable three-year performance period in order to receive any
portion of the shares

subject
to that award. Target shares subject to PRU awards do not have dividend equivalent rights and do not have the voting rights of common stock until earned and issued following the end of the
applicable performance period.

Stock
options granted under the principal option plans are generally non-qualified stock options, but the principal option plans permit some options granted to qualify as
"incentive stock options" under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. Stock options generally vest over four years from the date of grant. The exercise price of a stock option is equal to the fair market
value of HP's common stock on the option grant date (as determined by the reported sale prices of HP's common stock when the market closes on that date). The contractual term of options granted since
fiscal 2003 was generally eight years, while the contractual term of options granted prior to fiscal 2003 was generally ten years. Under the principal option plans, HP may choose, in certain cases, to
establish a discounted exercise price at no less than 75% of fair market value on the grant date. HP has not granted any discounted options since fiscal 2003.

Under
the principal option plans, HP granted certain employees cash-settled awards, restricted stock awards, or both. Restricted stock awards are non-vested stock
awards that may include grants of restricted stock or grants of restricted stock units. Cash-settled awards and restricted stock awards are independent of option grants and are generally
subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the release of the restrictions. Such awards generally vest one to three years from the date of grant. During that period, ownership of the
shares cannot be transferred. Restricted stock has the same cash dividend and voting rights as other common stock and is considered to be currently issued and outstanding. Restricted stock units have
dividend equivalent rights equal to the cash dividend paid on restricted stock. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying the restricted stock
units are not considered issued and outstanding. HP expenses the fair market value of restricted stock awards, as determined on the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions
lapse.

Performance-based Restricted Units

HP estimated the fair value of a target PRU share using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as the TSR modifier contains a market
condition. The following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the weighted-average fair values of the PRU awards for fiscal years ended October 31:

expects to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.5 years. At October 31, 2008, there was $108 million of unrecognized pre-tax stock-based
compensation expense related to PRUs with an assigned fair value, which HP expected to recognize over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.0 years.

Stock Options

HP utilized the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the stock options granted under its principal option plans. HP examined its
historical pattern of option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on certain employee populations. From this analysis, HP identified three employee
populations on which to apply the Black-Scholes model. The table below presents the weighted-average expected life in months of the combined three identified employee populations. The expected life
computation is based on historical exercise patterns and post-vesting termination behavior within each of the three populations identified. The risk-free interest rate for
periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

In fiscal 2008, approximately 8 million stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $50 per share were assumed through the
acquisition of EDS.

The
aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value that option holders would have received had all option holders exercised their
options on October 31, 2009 and 2008. The aggregate intrinsic value is the difference between HP's closing stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 and the exercise
price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options. Total intrinsic value of options exercised in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $0.8 billion, $1.1 billion
and $2.0 billion, respectively. Total fair value of options vested and expensed in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $172 million, $264 million and $297 million, respectively,
net of taxes.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

HP sponsors the Hewlett-Packard Company 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, also known as the Share Ownership Plan (the "ESPP"),
pursuant to which eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of base compensation, subject to certain income limits, to purchase shares of HP's common stock. For purchases made on or before
April 30, 2009, employees purchased stock pursuant to the ESPP semi-annually at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date, and HP recognized expense based
on a 15% discount of the fair
market value for those purchases. Effective May 1, 2009, HP modified the ESPP to eliminate the 15% discount applicable to purchases made under the ESPP.

Note 3: Net Earnings Per Share

HP calculates basic earnings per share using net earnings and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS includes any dilutive effect of
outstanding stock options, PRUs, restricted stock units, restricted stock and convertible debt.

HP
excludes options with exercise prices that are greater than the average market price from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would be anti-dilutive. In
fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, HP excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS options to purchase 85 million shares, 54 million shares and 60 million shares, respectively. HP also
excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS options to purchase an additional 2 million shares, 28 million shares and 33 million shares in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, whose combined exercise price, unamortized fair value and excess tax benefits were greater in each of those periods than the average market price for HP's common stock because their
effect would be anti-dilutive.

As
disclosed in Note 2, during fiscal 2009 and 2008, HP granted PRU awards representing at target approximately 14 million shares and 9 million shares, respectively.
HP includes the shares underlying PRU awards in the calculation of diluted EPS when they become contingently issuable and excludes such shares when they are not contingently issuable. Accordingly, for
fiscal 2009, HP has included 6 million shares underlying the PRU awards granted in fiscal 2009 and 2008 when calculating diluted EPS as those shares became contingently issuable upon the
satisfaction of the cash flow from operations condition with respect to the first year of the three-year performance period applicable to the fiscal 2009 awards and the first and second
years of the three-year performance period applicable to the fiscal 2008 awards. HP has excluded all other shares underlying the fiscal 2009 and 2008 PRU awards when calculating diluted
EPS as those shares are not contingently issuable. For fiscal 2008, HP has included 2 million shares underlying the PRU awards granted in fiscal 2008 when calculating diluted EPS as those
shares became contingently issuable upon the satisfaction of the cash flow from operations condition with respect to the first year of the three-year performance period applicable to



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Note 3: Net Earnings Per Share (Continued)

the
fiscal 2008 awards. HP has excluded all other shares underlying the fiscal 2008 PRU awards when calculating diluted EPS as those shares were not contingently issuable.

In
October and November 1997, HP issued U.S. dollar zero-coupon subordinated convertible notes due 2017 (the "LYONs"), the outstanding principal amount of which was redeemed
in March 2008. The LYONs were convertible at the option of the holders at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or otherwise purchased. For purposes of calculating diluted earnings
per share above, the interest expense (net of tax) associated with the LYONs was added back to net earnings, and the shares issuable upon conversion of the LYONs were included in the weighted-average
shares used to compute diluted earnings per share for periods that the LYONs were outstanding.

or extensions to standard product warranty, as well as high availability services for complex, global, networked, multi-vendor environments. HP defers these service amounts at the time HP bills the
customer, and HP then recognizes the amounts ratably over the contract life or as HP renders the services. HP also defers and subsequently amortizes certain set-up costs related to
activities that enable the performance of the customer contract. Deferred contract costs, including set-up and other unbilled costs, are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the remaining original contract term unless billing patterns indicate a more accelerated method is appropriate.

Note 6: Acquisitions

Acquisitions in fiscal 2009

In fiscal 2009, HP completed two acquisitions. Total consideration for the acquisitions was $390 million, which includes direct
transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities in connection with the transactions. HP recorded $315 million of goodwill, $105 million of purchased intangibles and
$7 million of in-process research and development charges ("IPR&D") related to these transactions. Projects that qualify for treatment as IPR&D have not yet reached technical
feasibility



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 6: Acquisitions (Continued)

and
have no alternative use. HP does not expect goodwill recorded with these acquisitions to be deductible for tax purposes. HP has not presented pro forma results of operations because the
acquisitions are not material to HP's consolidated financial statements.

The
largest of the two acquisitions is the acquisition of Lefthand Networks, Inc., a leading provider of storage virtualization and solutions, which has been integrated into HP's
Enterprise Storage and Servers segment. The total purchase price paid was $347 million in cash including direct transaction costs and the assumption of certain liabilities in connection with
the transaction. HP recorded $273 million to goodwill, $95 million to purchased intangibles and $6 million to IPR&D charges related to this acquisition. HP is amortizing the
purchased intangibles on a straight-line basis over a weighted-average estimated life of 6.3 years.

Pending Acquisition

In November 2009, HP entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 3Com Corporation ("3Com"), a global enterprise provider of
networking switching, routing and security solutions, at a price of $7.90 per share in cash or an enterprise value of approximately $2.7 billion. The acquisition is subject to customary closing
conditions, including the receipt of domestic and foreign regulatory approvals and the approval of 3Com's stockholders. The transaction is expected to close in HP's second fiscal quarter of 2010.

Acquisitions in fiscal 2008

Acquisition of Electronic Data Systems Corporation

On August 26, 2008, HP completed its acquisition of EDS, a leading global technology services company, delivering a broad
portfolio of information technology, applications and business process outsourcing services to clients in the manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, communications, energy, transportation, and
consumer and retail industries and to governments around the world.

The
purchase price for EDS was $13.0 billion, comprised of $12.7 billion cash paid for outstanding common stock, $328 million for the fair value of stock options and
restricted stock units assumed, and $36 million for direct transaction costs. Of the total purchase price, $10.4 billion has been allocated to goodwill, $4.6 billion has been
allocated to amortizable intangible assets acquired and $2.0 billion has been allocated to net tangible liabilities assumed in connection with the acquisition. HP also expensed
$30 million for IPR&D charges.

Pro forma results for EDS acquisition

The following table presents the unaudited pro forma results for the year ended October 31, 2008. The unaudited pro forma
financial information for the year ended October 31, 2008 combines the results of operations of HP and EDS as though the companies had been combined as of the beginning of fiscal 2008. The pro
forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not indicative of the results of operations that would have been achieved if the acquisition and related borrowings had
taken place at the beginning of fiscal 2008. The unaudited pro forma results presented include amortization charges for acquired intangible assets, eliminations of intercompany transactions,
restructuring charges, IPR&D charges, adjustments for incremental stock-based compensation expense related to the unearned portion of EDS stock options and restricted stock units assumed, adjustments

acquisitions and the minority interest purchase was $1.6 billion, which includes direct transaction costs, the fair value of stock options assumed and certain liabilities recorded in connection
with these transactions. HP recorded $1.0 billion of goodwill, $600 million of purchased intangibles and $15 million of IPR&D related to these transactions.

The
largest of these transactions was the acquisition of Exstream Software, LLC, which has been integrated into HP's Imaging and Printing Group. The total purchase price paid was
$720 million, which included direct transaction costs as well as certain debt that was repaid at the acquisition date. In connection with this acquisition, HP recorded $434 million of
goodwill, $235 million of purchased intangibles and expensed $11 million for IPR&D. HP is amortizing the purchased intangibles on a straight-line basis over a
weighted-average estimated life of 6.8 years.

During fiscal 2009, HP recorded adjustments of approximately $306 million to the estimated fair values of EDS's intangible assets and net
liabilities acquired resulting in an increase to EDS's goodwill, which is allocated to the Services segment. These changes in the estimated fair values relate primarily to restructuring liabilities,
fixed assets, net deferred tax liabilities and intangible assets. In addition, goodwill increased approximately $255 million as a result of currency translation related to certain of

EDS's
foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar. These increases in goodwill were partially offset by tax adjustments for various previous acquisitions.

Based
on the results of its annual impairment tests, HP determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of August 1, 2009 or August 1, 2008. However, future goodwill
impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. HP will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events and changes in
circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment.

Note 8: Restructuring Charges

Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan

In May 2009, HP's management approved and initiated a restructuring plan to structurally change and improve the effectiveness of the
Imaging and Printing Group ("IPG"), the Personal Systems Group ("PSG"), and Enterprise Storage and Servers ("ESS"). In fiscal 2009, HP recorded a net charge of $297 million in severance-related
costs associated with the planned elimination of approximately 5,000 positions. As of October 31, 2009, approximately 2,100 positions have been eliminated. HP expects the majority of the
restructuring costs to be paid out by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010. In future quarters, HP expects to record an additional charge of approximately $6 million related to severance costs
associated with this plan.

Fiscal 2008 HP/EDS Restructuring Plan

In connection with the acquisition of EDS on August 26, 2008, HP's management approved and initiated a restructuring plan to
streamline the combined company's services business and to better align the structure and efficiency of that business with HP's operating model. The restructuring plan is expected to be implemented
over four years from the acquisition date and includes changes to the combined company's workforce as well as changes to corporate overhead functions such as real estate and IT.

In
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, HP recorded a liability of approximately $1.8 billion related to this restructuring plan. Approximately $1.5 billion of the liability
was associated with pre-acquisition EDS and was recorded to goodwill, and the remaining approximately $0.3 billion was associated with HP and was recorded as a restructuring charge.
The liability consisted mainly of severance costs to eliminate approximately 25,000 positions, costs to vacate duplicative facilities and costs associated with early termination of certain contractual
obligations. HP recorded net charges for severance and facilities costs of $346 million, for the twelve months ended October 31, 2009, along with year-to-date
adjustments to goodwill of $276 million. As of October 31, 2009, over 19,000 positions have been eliminated.

HP
expects the majority of the restructuring costs to be paid out by the second quarter of fiscal 2010. In future quarters, HP expects to record an additional charge of approximately
$465 million related to the cost to vacate duplicative facilities and severance costs.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 8: Restructuring Charges (Continued)

All
restructuring costs associated with pre-acquisition EDS are reflected in the purchase price of EDS. These costs are subject to change based on the actual costs incurred.
Changes to these estimates could decrease the amount of the purchase price allocated to goodwill.

Prior Fiscal Year Plans

Restructuring plans initiated prior to 2008 are substantially complete and HP expects to record only minor revisions to these plans as
necessary.

Summary of Restructuring Plans

The adjustments to the accrued restructuring expenses related to all of HP's restructuring plans described above for the twelve months
ended October 31, 2009 were as follows:

At October 31, 2009 and October 31, 2008, HP included the long-term portion of the restructuring liability of
$356 million and $670 million, respectively, in Other liabilities, and the short-term portion in Accrued restructuring in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Workforce Rebalancing

As part of HP's ongoing business operations, HP incurred workforce rebalancing charges for severance and related costs within certain
business segments during fiscal 2009. Workforce rebalancing activities are considered part of normal operations as HP continues to optimize
its cost structure. Workforce rebalancing costs are included in HP's business segment results, and HP expects to incur additional workforce rebalancing costs in the future.

Note 9: Fair Value

HP adopted certain provisions of the new accounting standard related to fair value in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2009. The adoption did not have a material impact on HP's
financial statements and did not result in any changes to the opening balance of retained earnings as of November 1, 2008. HP will adopt the remaining provisions related to the fair value of
nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for the following major categories of nonfinancial assets and liabilities from the Consolidated Balance Sheet:
Property, plant and equipment, Goodwill, Purchased intangible assets, and the asset retirement obligations within Other accrued liabilities and Other liabilities.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 9: Fair Value (Continued)

The
new standard codifies a new framework for measuring fair value and expands related disclosures. The framework requires fair value to be determined based on the exchange price that
would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants.

The
valuation techniques required by the new provisions are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable or market inputs reflect market data obtained from independent
sources, while unobservable inputs reflect HP's assumptions about market participant assumptions based on best information available. Observable inputs are the preferred source of values. These two
types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:

Level 1—Quoted
prices (unadjusted) for identical instruments in active markets.

Level 2—Quoted
prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based
valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 3—Prices
or valuations that require management inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.

The
following section describes the valuation methodologies HP uses to measure its financial assets and liabilities at fair value.

Cash
Equivalents and Investments: HP holds time deposits, money market funds, commercial paper, other debt securities primarily consisting of corporate and foreign government notes and
bonds, and common stock and equivalents. In general, and where applicable, HP uses quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. If quoted prices in active markets for
identical assets are not available to determine fair value, HP uses quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly. If quoted prices for
identical or similar assets are not available, HP uses internally developed valuation models, whose inputs include bid prices, and third party valuations utilizing underlying assets assumptions.

Derivative
Instruments: As discussed in Note 10, HP mainly holds non-speculative forwards, swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate
exposures. When active market quotes are not available, HP uses industry standard valuation models. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a
present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit risk, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. In certain cases, market-based
observable inputs are not available and, in those cases, HP uses management judgment to develop assumptions which are used to determine fair value.

other-than-temporarily impaired. As of October 31, 2009, such assets with a total fair value of

$39 million
were measured using level 3 inputs. HP recorded an impairment charge of $18 million relating to these investments.

HP
reviews the carrying values of the investments when events and circumstances warrant and considers all available evidence in evaluating when declines in fair value are
other-than-temporary declines. HP determines fair values for investments in public companies using quoted market prices and records a charge to Interest and other, net when the
change in fair values is determined to be an other-than-temporary change. HP carries equity investments in privately-held companies at cost or at fair value when HP recognizes an
other-than-temporary impairment charge.

HP
monitors its investment portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of an investment in debt securities exceeds its fair value and the decline
in value is determined to be an other-than-temporary decline and 1) HP does not intend to sell the debt security, and 2) when it is not more likely than not that HP will be required to
sell the debt security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis, HP records an impairment charge to Interest and other, net in the amount of the credit loss and the balance, if any, to other
comprehensive income.

Effective
November 1, 2008, HP adopted the accounting standards related to financial instruments which allows an entity to elect to measure certain financial instruments at fair
value on a
contract-by-contract basis. Subsequent to the election, any unrealized gains and losses from the fair value measurement of the financial instruments will be recognized in
earnings. As of October 31, 2009, HP did not elect such option for any eligible financial instruments.

equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of ninety days or less. Available-for-sale securities consist of short-term
investments which mature within twelve months or less and long-term investments with maturities longer than twelve months. Investments include time deposits consisting of certificate of
deposits, corporate commercial paper and other debt securities consisting primarily of fixed-interest securities and institutional bonds. As discussed in Note 9, HP estimated the fair values of
its investments based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. These estimated fair values may not be representative of actual values that will be realized in the future.

The
gross unrealized loss as of October 31, 2009 was due primarily to declines in certain debt securities. The gross unrealized loss includes $20 million that has been in a
continuous loss position for more than twelve months. The gross unrealized loss as of October 31, 2008 had been in a continuous loss position
for less than twelve months. HP does not intend to sell these debt securities and it is not likely that HP will be required to sell these debt securities prior to the recovery of the amortized cost.

HP's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The net losses associated with these securities were $14 million for fiscal 2009. The net gains associated with these securities were $5 million
for fiscal 2008.

Derivative Financial Instruments

On February 1, 2009, HP adopted the accounting standards related to derivative instruments and hedging. The adoption requires
additional disclosures about HP's objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments, the accounting for the derivative instruments and related hedged items and the



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 10: Financial Instruments (Continued)

effect
of derivative instruments and related hedged items on the financial statements. The adoption had no financial impact on the consolidated financial statements.

HP
is a global company that is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of its business. As part of its risk management
strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, option contracts, interest rate swaps, and total return swaps, to hedge certain foreign currency, interest rate and, to a lesser
extent, equity exposures. HP's objective is to offset gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility
of earnings or protecting fair values of assets and liabilities. HP does not have any leveraged derivatives. HP does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. HP designates its
derivatives as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation ("net investment hedges"). Additionally, for derivatives not
designated as hedging instruments, HP categorizes those economic hedges as other derivatives. HP recognizes all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and reports them in Other
current assets, Long-term financing receivables and other assets, Other accrued liabilities, or Other liabilities. HP classifies cash flows from the derivative programs as operating
activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

As
a result of the use of derivative instruments, HP is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the
counterparty credit risk, HP has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors, and HP maintains
dollar and term limits that correspond to each institution's credit rating. HP's established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on principal transactions and short-term
cash include reviewing and establishing limits for credit exposure and continually assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. Master agreements with counterparties include master netting
arrangements as further mitigation of credit exposure to counterparties. These arrangements permit HP to net amounts due from HP to a
counterparty with amounts due to HP from a counterparty, which reduces the maximum loss from credit risk in the event of counterparty default.

Certain
of HP's derivative instruments contain credit-risk-related contingent features, such as a provision whereby the counterparties to the derivative
instruments could request collateralization on derivative instruments in net liability positions if HP's credit rating falls below investment grade. As of October 31, 2009, HP was not required
to post any collateral, and HP did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a significant net liability position.

Fair Value Hedges

HP enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to interest rate risk. HP issues long-term
debt in U.S. dollars based on market conditions at the time of financing. HP uses interest rate swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily U.S. dollar
LIBOR-based floating interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts. Alternatively, HP may choose not to swap fixed
for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. When investing in
fixed-rate instruments, HP may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest returns into variable interest returns and would classify these swaps as fair value hedges.
For derivative instruments that are designated and



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 10: Financial Instruments (Continued)

qualify
as fair value hedges, HP recognizes the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item, in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated
Statements of Earnings in the current period.

Cash Flow Hedges

HP uses a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange
rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales, operating expense, and intercompany lease loan denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. HP's
foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within six to twelve months. However, certain leasing revenue-related forward contracts and intercompany lease loan forward contracts extend for the
duration of the lease term, which can be up to five years. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, HP
initially records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders' equity and subsequently
reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. HP reports the effective portion of cash flow hedges in the same financial
statement line item as the changes in value of the hedged item. During fiscal 2009 and 2008, HP did not discontinue any cash flow hedge for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would
not occur.

Net Investment Hedges

HP uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional
currency is the local currency. These derivative instruments are designated as net investment hedges and, as such, HP records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument
together with changes in the hedged items in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of stockholders' equity.

Other Derivatives

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of forward contracts HP uses to hedge foreign currency
balance sheet exposures. HP also uses total return swaps and, to a lesser extent, interest rate swaps, based on the equity and fixed income indices, to hedge its executive deferred compensation plan
liability. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments, HP recognizes changes in the fair values in earnings in the period of change. HP recognizes the gain or loss on foreign
currency forward contracts used to hedge balance sheet exposures in Interest and other, net in the same period as the remeasurement gain and loss of the related foreign currency denominated assets and
liabilities. HP recognizes the gain or loss on the total return swaps and interest rate swaps in Interest and other, net in the same period as the gain or loss from the change in market value of the
executive deferred compensation plan liability.

Hedge Effectiveness

For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged
debt with the change in fair value of the derivative. For foreign currency options and forward contracts designated as cash flow or net investment hedges, HP measures effectiveness by comparing the
cumulative change in the hedge contract with the cumulative change in



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 10: Financial Instruments (Continued)

the
hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. HP recognizes any ineffective portion of the hedge, as well as amounts not included in the assessment of effectiveness, in the Consolidated
Statements of Earnings. As of October 31, 2009, the portion of hedging instruments' gain or loss excluded from the assessment of effectiveness was not material for fair value, cash flow or net
investment hedges. Hedge ineffectiveness for fair value, cash flow and net investment hedges was not material in fiscal years 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Fair Value of Derivative Instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet

As discussed in Note 9, HP estimates the fair values of derivatives primarily based on pricing models using current market rates
and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The gross notional and fair value of derivative financial instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2009

Other Financial Instruments

For the balance of HP's financial instruments, accounts receivable, financing receivables, notes payable and short-term
borrowings, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The estimated fair value of HP's short- and long-term
debt was approximately $16.0 billion at October 31, 2009, compared to a carrying value of $15.8 billion at that date. The estimated fair value of the debt is based primarily on
quoted market prices, as well as borrowing rates currently available to HP for bank loans with similar terms and maturities.

Note 11: Financing Receivables and Operating Leases

Financing receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases resulting from the marketing of HP's and third-party products. These receivables typically have terms
from two to five years and are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from operating leases. The components of
net financing receivables, which are included in financing receivables and long-term financing receivables and other assets, were as follows for the following fiscal years ended

Note 12: Guarantees

Guarantees and Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, HP may provide certain clients with subsidiary performance guarantees and/or financial performance
guarantees, which may be backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds. In general, HP would be liable for the amounts of these guarantees in the event HP or HP's subsidiaries' nonperformance
permits termination of the related contract by the client, the likelihood of which HP believes is remote. HP believes that the company is in compliance with the performance obligations under all
material service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee.

As
a result of the acquisition of EDS, HP acquired certain service contracts supported by client financing or securitization arrangements. Under specific circumstances involving
nonperformance resulting in service contract termination or failure to comply with terms under the financing arrangement, HP would be required to acquire certain assets. HP considers the possibility
of its failure to comply to be remote and the asset amounts involved to be immaterial.

In
the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any losses incurred relating to
the services they perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or claims relating to past
performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.

Warranty

HP provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. HP engages in extensive product quality
programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, product warranty terms offered to customers, ongoing product failure rates,
material usage and service delivery costs incurred in

correcting
a product failure, as well as specific product class failures outside of HP's baseline experience, affect the estimated warranty obligation. If actual product failure rates, repair rates or
any other post sales support costs differ from these estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

HP
may redeem some or all of the Global Notes set forth in the above table at any time at the redemption prices described in the prospectus supplements relating thereto. The Global Notes
are senior unsecured debt.

HP
registered the sale of up to $3.0 billion of debt or global securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants under a shelf registration statement in
March 2002 (the "2002 Shelf Registration Statement"). The 2002 Shelf Registration Statement expired on December 1, 2008, and, accordingly, HP is no longer able to issue any additional
securities under this registration statement.

In
May 2009, HP filed a shelf registration statement (the "2009 Shelf Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") to enable the company to offer for
sale, from time to time, in one or more offerings, an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. The 2009 Shelf Registration Statement
replaced a similar registration statement filed in May 2006 that expired in May 2009.

In
May 2008, HP's Board of Directors approved an increase in the capacity of HP's U.S. commercial paper program by $10.0 billion to $16.0 billion. HP's subsidiaries are
authorized to issue up to an additional $1.0 billion of commercial paper, of which $500 million of capacity is currently available to be used by Hewlett-Packard International
Bank PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HP, for its Euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Programme.

In
October 2008, HP registered for the Commercial Paper Funding Facility ("CPFF") provided by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The facility enables HP to issue three-month unsecured
commercial paper through a special purpose vehicle of the Federal Reserve at a rate established by the CPFF program, which is currently equal to a spread over the three-month overnight index swap
rate. The maximum amount of commercial paper that HP may issue at any time through this program is $10.4 billion less the total principal amount of all other outstanding commercial paper that
HP has issued. The CPFF program is currently scheduled to expire on February 1, 2010. As of October 31, 2009, HP had not issued any commercial paper under the CPFF program.

HP
has a $2.9 billion five-year credit facility expiring in May 2012. In February and July 2008, HP entered into additional 364-day credit facilities of
$3.0 billion and $8.0 billion, respectively. The



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 13: Borrowings (Continued)

February
2008 credit facility expired in February 2009, at which time HP entered into a new $3.5 billion 364-day credit facility. HP terminated the July 2008 credit facility in June
2009, which reduced the total amount available under its credit facilities to $6.4 billion. Commitment fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit facilities vary based
on HP's external credit ratings. The credit facilities are senior unsecured committed borrowing arrangements primarily to support the
issuance of U.S. commercial paper. HP's ability to have a U.S. commercial paper outstanding balance that exceeds the $6.4 billion supported these credit facilities is subject to a number of factors,
including liquidity conditions and business performance.

HP
also maintains uncommitted lines of credit from a number of financial institutions that are available through various foreign subsidiaries. The amount available for use as of
October 31, 2009 was approximately $1.6 billion.

Included
in Other, including capital lease obligations, are borrowings that are collateralized by certain financing receivable assets. As of October 31, 2009, the carrying value
of the assets approximated the carrying value of the borrowings of $10 million.

At
October 31, 2009, HP was able to issue an unspecified amount of additional debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants under the 2009 Shelf
Registration Statement. As of that date, HP also had up to approximately $17.8 billion of available borrowing resources, including $16.2 billion under its commercial paper programs,
$6.4 billion of which is supported by its credit facilities, and approximately $1.6 billion under other programs.

Aggregate
future maturities of long-term debt at face value (excluding a fair value adjustment related to hedged debt of $369 million, a premium on debt issuance of
$56 million, and a discount on debt issuance of $28 million) were as follows at October 31, 2009:

these respective totals begin to expire in fiscal 2010. Of the $30.5 billion of foreign net operating losses, $24.1 billion relates to foreign losses arising in fiscal 2009 pursuant to internal
restructuring transactions. HP has provided a valuation allowance of $218 million for deferred tax assets related to federal and state net

operating
losses and $8.0 billion on deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards that HP does not expect to realize.

As
of October 31, 2009, HP had recorded deferred tax assets for various tax credit carryforwards of $1.4 billion. This amount includes $687 million of foreign tax credit carryforwards
which begin to expire in fiscal 2015, and against which HP has recorded a valuation allowance of $47 million. HP had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $9 million, which do
not expire, and research and development credit carryforwards of $395 million, which will begin to expire in fiscal 2019. HP also had tax credit carryforwards of $350 million in various states and
foreign countries, for which HP has provided a valuation allowance of $179 million to reduce the related deferred tax asset. These credits begin to expire in fiscal 2010.

Gross
deferred tax assets at October 31, 2009 and 2008 were reduced by valuation allowances of $8.7 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The valuation allowance
increased by $6.9 billion in fiscal 2009. The valuation allowance increase consisted of $7.0 billion associated with foreign net operating loss carryovers arising in fiscal 2009 pursuant
to internal restructuring transactions, reduced by $100 million of valuation allowance decreases associated with state and foreign net operating losses.

Gross
deferred tax assets at October 31, 2008 and 2007 were reduced by valuation allowances of $1.8 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. The valuation allowance increased by
$258 million in fiscal 2008. The valuation allowance increases consisted of $449 million recorded for deferred tax assets acquired in current year acquisitions, $126 million recorded for deferred tax
assets related to certain federal and state net operating loss carryovers and tax credits, and $47 million related to deferred tax assets for foreign tax credit carryovers. These increases were
partially offset by a $203 million net reduction in the valuation allowances due to adjustments to deferred tax assets related to foreign net operating loss carryovers, and $161 million in the
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets related to foreign tax credits and net operating losses carryovers as a result of the adoption of the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes.

Net
excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs, are recorded as an increase in stockholders' equity and were
approximately $163 million in fiscal 2009, $316 million in fiscal 2008, and $530 million in fiscal 2007.

Note 14: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)

In
fiscal 2009, HP recorded $547 million of net income tax benefits related to items unique to the year. The recorded amounts included $383 million of income tax benefits
attributable to net deferred tax assets for foreign net operating loss carryovers arising pursuant to internal restructuring transactions. Also included were a net tax benefit of $154 million
for the adjustment to estimated fiscal 2008 tax accruals upon filing the 2008 income tax returns, a $60 million income tax benefit for valuation allowance reversals for state and foreign net
operating losses, and other miscellaneous items that resulted in a net tax charge of $50 million.

In
fiscal 2008, HP recorded $251 million of net income tax expense related to items unique to the year. The recorded amounts consisted of a tax charge of $205 million
associated with post-acquisition EDS integration, $44 million for the adjustment to estimated fiscal 2007 tax accruals upon filing the 2007 U.S. federal income tax return, and net
tax charges of $2 million attributable to other items.

In
October 2008, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 was signed into law, which included a retroactive two year extension of the research and development tax credit from
January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. The retroactive income tax benefit of $45 million was recorded in HP's financial statements in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008.

In
fiscal 2007, HP recorded $80 million of net income tax benefit related to items unique to the year. The recorded amounts consisted of income tax benefits for valuation
allowance reversals of $154 million attributable to deferred tax assets for state tax credits and $60 million attributable to deferred tax assets for foreign net operating losses, offset
by a $96 million net increase to various tax reserves, a net tax charge of $18 million for the adjustment to estimated fiscal 2006 tax accruals upon filing the 2006 U.S. federal and
state income tax returns, and a net tax charge of $20 million for other items.

As
a result of certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing and services in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in
some cases is wholly exempt from taxes, through 2022. The gross income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be $853 million ($0.35 per share) in
fiscal year 2009, $900 million ($0.35 per share) in fiscal year 2008, and $1.2 billion ($0.43 per share) in fiscal year 2007. The gross income tax benefits were offset partially by
accruals of U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings, among other factors.

The
total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $1.9 billion as of October 31, 2009, of which up to $950 million would affect HP's effective tax rate if
realized. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Note 14: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)

HP
recognizes interest income from favorable settlements and income tax receivables and interest expense and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits within income tax expense. As
of October 31, 2009, HP had accrued a net $115 million payable for interest and penalties. During fiscal 2009, HP recognized net interest income on tax overpayments and deficiencies, net
of tax, of $40 million.

HP
engages in continuous discussion and negotiation with taxing authorities regarding tax matters in the various jurisdictions. HP does not expect complete resolution of any IRS audit
cycle within the next 12 months. However, it is reasonably possible that certain foreign and state tax issues may be concluded in the next 12 months, including issues involving transfer
pricing and other matters. Accordingly, HP
believes it is reasonably possible that its existing unrecognized tax benefits may be reduced by an amount up to $120 million within the next twelve months.

HP
is subject to income tax in the United States and over sixty foreign countries and is subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. In addition, HP is
subject to numerous ongoing audits by state and foreign tax authorities. HP has received from the IRS Notices of Deficiency for its fiscal 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004 and 2005 tax years, and Revenue
Agent's Reports ("RARs") for its fiscal 2001 and 2002 tax years. The IRS began an audit of HP's 2006 and 2007 income tax returns in 2009. With respect to major foreign and state tax jurisdictions, HP
is no longer subject to tax authority examinations for years prior to 1999. HP believes that adequate reserves have been provided for all open tax years.

On
July 30, 2009, HP received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS for its fiscal 2004 and 2005 tax years. The Notice of Deficiency asserted that HP owes additional tax of
$92 million and penalties of $5 million. In addition to the proposed deficiency for fiscal 2004 and 2005, the IRS's adjustments for both years, if sustained, would reduce the tax
benefits of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to subsequent years by approximately $563 million. HP plans to contest certain of the adjustments proposed in the Notice of
Deficiency. HP believes that it has provided adequate reserves for any tax deficiencies or reductions in tax benefits that could result from the IRS actions.

Tax
years of EDS through 2002 have been audited by the IRS, and all proposed adjustments have been resolved. The IRS is currently auditing EDS's tax years 2005 and 2006. On
December 5, 2008, EDS received a RAR for exam years 2003 and 2004, proposing a tax deficiency of $82 million. This deficiency includes a $12 million effect on carrybacks to 2000
and 2001. HP is appealing certain issues and believes adequate reserves have been provided for all years.

On
January 30, 2008, HP received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS for its fiscal 2003 tax year. The Notice of Deficiency asserted that HP owes additional tax of
$21 million. At the same time, HP received a RAR from the IRS for its fiscal 2002 tax year that proposed no change in HP's tax liability for that year. In addition to the proposed deficiency
for fiscal 2003, the IRS's adjustments for both years, if sustained, would reduce tax refund claims HP has filed for net operating loss carrybacks to earlier fiscal years and reduce the tax benefits
of tax credit carryforwards to subsequent years, by approximately $249 million. This amount reflects certain transfer pricing adjustments that were settled during fiscal 2008. HP plans to
contest certain remaining adjustments proposed in the Notice of Deficiency and the RAR. Towards this end, HP filed a petition with the United States Tax Court on April 29, 2008. HP believes
that it has provided adequate reserves for any tax deficiencies or reductions in refund claims that could result from the IRS actions.

Note 14: Taxes on Earnings (Continued)

On
June 28, 2007, HP received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS for its fiscal 1999 and 2000 tax years. The Notice of Deficiency asserted that HP owes additional tax of
$13 million for these two years. At the same time, HP received a RAR from IRS for its fiscal 2001 tax year that proposed no change in HP's tax liability for that year. In addition to the
proposed deficiencies for fiscal 1999 and 2000, the IRS's adjustments, if sustained, would reduce tax refund claims HP has filed for foreign tax credit and net operating loss carrybacks to earlier
fiscal years and reduce the tax benefits of carryforwards to subsequent years, by approximately $80 million. HP plans to contest certain of the adjustments proposed in the Notice of Deficiency
and the RAR. Towards this end, HP filed a Petition with the United States Tax Court on September 25, 2007. HP believes that it has provided adequate reserves for any tax deficiencies or
reductions in refund claims that could result from the IRS actions.

HP
has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $16.5 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of October 31,
2009 because HP intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. If HP were to distribute these earnings, foreign tax credits may become available under current law to
reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. HP will remit
non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of its non-US subsidiaries for which deferred U.S. federal and withholding taxes have been provided where excess cash has accumulated and
it determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax or cash management reasons.

Note 15: Stockholders' Equity

Dividends

The stockholders of HP common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by HP's Board of Directors. Dividends are
paid quarterly. Dividends were $0.32 per common share in each of fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Stock Repurchase Program

HP's share repurchase program authorizes both open market and private repurchase transactions. In fiscal 2009, HP executed share
repurchases of 120 million shares. Repurchases of 132 million shares were settled for $5.1 billion, which included 14 million shares repurchased in transactions that were
executed in fiscal 2008 but settled in fiscal 2009. HP had approximately 2 million shares repurchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009 that will be settled in the next fiscal year. In
fiscal 2008, HP completed share repurchases of approximately 230 million shares. Repurchases of approximately 216 million shares were settled for $9.6 billion, which included
approximately 1 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal 2007 but settled in fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2007, HP completed share repurchases of approximately
209 million shares. Repurchases of approximately 210 million shares were settled for $9.1 billion, which included approximately 1 million shares repurchased in transactions
that were executed in fiscal 2006 but settled in fiscal 2007. The foregoing shares repurchased and settled in fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007 were all open market repurchase transactions.

In
addition to the above transactions, HP entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (the "ASR Program") with a third-party investment bank during the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Program, HP purchased 40 million shares of its common stock from the investment bank for $1.8 billion (the "Purchase Price") on March 30, 2007
(the "Purchase Date"). HP decreased its shares outstanding and reduced the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 15: Stockholders' Equity (Continued)

average
common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS on the Purchase Date. The shares delivered to HP included shares that the investment bank borrowed from third parties. The investment
bank purchased an equivalent number of shares in the open market to cover its position with respect to the borrowed shares during a contractually specified averaging period that began on the Purchase
Date and ended on June 6, 2007. At the end of the averaging period, the investment bank's total purchase cost based on the volume weighted-average purchase price of HP shares during the
averaging period was approximately $90 million less than the Purchase Price. Accordingly, HP had the option to either receive additional shares of HP's common stock or a cash payment in the
amount of the difference from the investment bank. In June 2007, HP received approximately 2 million additional shares
purchased by the investment bank in the open market with a value approximately equal to that amount. HP reduced its shares outstanding upon receipt of those shares.

Also,
HP entered into a prepaid variable share purchase program ("PVSPP") with a third-party investment bank during the first quarter of 2006 and prepaid approximately
$1.7 billion in exchange for the right to receive a variable number of shares of its common stock weekly over a one-year period beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and
ending during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Under the PVSPP, the prices at which HP purchased the shares were subject to a minimum and maximum price that was determined in advance of any
repurchases being completed under the program, thereby effectively hedging HP's repurchase price. The minimum and maximum number of shares HP could receive under the program was 52 million
shares and 70 million shares, respectively. The exact number of shares to be repurchased was based upon the volume weighted-average market price of HP's shares during each weekly settlement
period, subject to the minimum and maximum price as well as regulatory limitations on the number of shares HP was permitted to repurchase. HP decreased its shares outstanding each settlement period as
shares were physically received. HP completed all repurchases under the PVSPP on March 9, 2007. As of that date, HP had cumulatively received a total of 53 million shares.

In
fiscal 2009, there was no additional authorization for future share repurchases by HP's Board of Directors. In fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, HP's Board of Directors authorized an
additional $16.0 billion and $8.0 billion for future share repurchases, respectively. As of October 31, 2009, HP had remaining authorization of approximately $4.0 billion
for future share repurchases under the $8.0 billion repurchase authorization approved by HP's Board of Directors on September 19, 2008. On November 19, 2009, HP's Board of
Directors authorized an additional $8.0 billion for future share repurchases.

Note 16: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Acquisition of EDS

On August 26, 2008, EDS became a wholly owned subsidiary of HP. EDS sponsors qualified and non-qualified defined
benefit pension plans covering substantially all of its employees. The majority of the EDS defined benefit pension plans are noncontributory. In most plans, employees become fully vested upon
attaining two to five years of service, and benefits are based on many factors, which differ by country, but the most significant is years of service and earnings. The projected unit credit cost
method is used for actuarial purposes. Plan assets and plan obligations associated with the EDS defined benefit pension plans were included as of the acquisition date and through October 31,
2008. On a global basis, EDS plan assets totaled $7.8 billion and plan obligations totaled $10.1 billion as of August 26, 2008. The U.S. portion of global assets and obligations
totaled $4.1 billion and $5.0 billion respectively.

Defined Benefit Plans

HP sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans worldwide, of which the most significant are in the United States. Both the HP
Retirement Plan (the "Retirement Plan"), a traditional defined benefit pension plan based on pay and years of service, and the HP Company Cash Account Pension Plan (the "Cash Account Pension Plan"),
under which benefits are accrued pursuant to a cash accumulation account formula based upon a percentage of pay plus interest, were frozen effective January 1, 2008. The Cash Account Pension
Plan and the Retirement Plan were merged in 2005 for certain funding and investment purposes. The merged plan is referred to as the HP Pension Plan.

Following
the acquisition of EDS, HP announced that it was modifying the EDS U.S. qualified and non-qualified plans for employees accruing benefits under the programs.
Effective January 1, 2009, EDS employees in the U.S. ceased accruing pension benefits. The final pension benefit amount was calculated based on pay and service through December 31, 2008.

Effective
October 30, 2009, the EDS U.S. qualified pension plan was also merged into the HP Pension Plan. The EDS U.S. qualified pension plan, like the Cash Account Pension Plan
and the Retirement Plan, remains a separate sub-plan within the HP Pension Plan for purposes of determining benefit amounts. As a result, the merger had no impact on the separate benefit structures of
the plans.

HP
reduces the benefit payable to a U.S. employee under the Pension Plan for service before 1993, if any, by any amounts due to the employee under HP's frozen defined contribution
Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan (the "DPSP"). HP closed the DPSP to new participants in 1993. The DPSP plan obligations are equal to the plan assets and are recognized as an offset to the Pension Plan
when HP calculates its defined benefit pension cost and obligations. The fair value of plan assets and projected

and 2008 plan assets and projected benefit obligation include the EDS U.S. pension plans.

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Through fiscal 2005, substantially all of HP's U.S. employees at December 31, 2002 could become eligible for partially
subsidized retiree medical benefits and retiree life insurance benefits under the Pre-2003 HP Retiree Medical Program (the "Pre-2003 Program") and certain other retiree medical
programs. Plan participants in the Pre-2003 Program make contributions based on their choice of medical option and length of service. U.S. employees hired or rehired on or after
January 1, 2003 may be eligible to participate in a post-retirement medical plan, the HP Retiree Medical Program, but must bear the full cost of their participation. Effective
January 1, 2006, employees whose combination of age and years of service was less than 62 no longer were eligible for the subsidized Pre-2003 Program, but instead were eligible for
the HP Retiree Medical Program. Employees no longer eligible for the Pre-2003 Program, as well as employees hired on or after January 1, 2003, are eligible for certain credits under
the HP Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan ("RMSA Plan") upon attaining age 45. Upon retirement, former employees may use credits under the RMSA Plan for the reimbursement of certain eligible
medical expenses, including premiums required for participation in the HP Retiree Medical Program. In February 2007, HP further limited future eligibility for the Pre-2003 HP Retiree
Medical Program to those employees who were within five years of satisfying the program's retirement criteria on June 30, 2007. Employees not meeting the modified program criteria may become
eligible for participation in the HP Retiree Medical Program. In November 2008, HP announced that it was changing the limits on future cost-sharing for the Pre-2003 Program
whereby all future cost increases will be paid by participating retirees starting in 2011. In June 2008, HP modified the RMSA Plan to provide that generally only those employees who were employed with
HP as of July 31, 2008 would be eligible to receive employer credits. In September 2008, HP further modified the RMSA Plan to provide that such employees would receive employer credits only in
the form of matching contributions.

Defined Contribution Plans

HP offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution expense was
$568 million in fiscal 2009, $548 million in fiscal 2008 and $481 million in fiscal 2007. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Company 401(k) Plan (the
"HP 401(k) Plan") when they meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

Similar
to HP, EDS offered participation in defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees.

During
fiscal 2008, HP matched employee contributions to the HP 401(k) Plan with cash contributions up to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation for U.S. employees hired prior to
August 1, 2008. For U.S. employees hired on or after August 1, 2008 HP matched employee contributions up to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation.

The
employer match for the EDS plan was 25% of the employee contribution based on a maximum contribution of 6% of the employee's salary. Effective January 1, 2009, U.S. employees
participating in the EDS 401(k) plan became eligible for a 4% HP matching contribution on eligible compensation. Similar to the HP 401(k) plan, contributions are invested at the direction of the
employee in various funds, although the EDS 401(k) plan does not offer an HP stock fund.

Effective
April 1, 2009, HP matching contributions under both the U.S. HP 401(k) Plan and the EDS 401(k) Plan were changed to a quarterly, discretionary, performance-based match
of up to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation for all U.S. employees, which will be determined each fiscal quarter based on business results. HP matching contributions will vary from 0% to 100% of
the maximum 4% match, based on such factors as quarterly earnings, market share growth, and performance relative to market and economic conditions. HP's matching contributions for the quarter ended
October 31, 2009 was 100% of the maximum 4% match.

Effective
January 31, 2004, HP designated the HP Stock Fund, an investment option under the HP 401(k) Plan, as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and, as a result,
participants in the HP Stock Fund may receive dividends in cash or may reinvest such dividends into the HP Stock Fund. HP paid approximately $8 million, $9 million and $9 million
in dividends for the HP common shares held by the HP Stock Fund in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. HP records the dividends as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements
of Stockholders' Equity. The HP Stock Fund held approximately 25 million shares of HP common stock at October 31, 2009.

In
fiscal 2009, HP recognized aggregate pension curtailment and settlement losses totaling $5 million and $12 million, respectively, resulting from workforce rebalancing
initiatives in several non-U.S. countries. In the U.K., workforce rebalancing initiatives triggered pension termination benefits totaling $55 million. In the U.S., a settlement gain
of $1 million was recognized for payout activity related to non-qualified plans. In Puerto Rico, a curtailment gain of $2 million was recognized for the closure of the
retiree medical plan.

A

Stemming
from the plan changes announced in November 2008, the employer subsidy for the U.S. retiree medical plans will "freeze" in fiscal 2010. Therefore, trend rates for 2010
and beyond are no longer relevant to the liability calculation since the excess cost will be picked up by retirees.

A
1.0 percentage point increase in the medical cost trend rate would have increased the total post-retirement benefit obligation reported at October 31, 2009 by
$3 million, while a 1.0 percentage point decrease would have resulted in a decrease of $3 million.

Investment Policy

HP's investment strategy for worldwide plan assets is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk
depending on the funded status of each plan. The majority of the plans' investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which
they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans' investment
managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment or liability exposures, and HP utilizes derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment or liability
exposures.

The
target asset allocation selected for each U.S. plan reflects a risk/return profile HP feels is appropriate relative to each plan's liability structure and return goals. HP conducts
periodic asset-liability studies for U.S. plan assets in order to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plan's forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs. HP invests a
portion of the U.S. defined benefit plan assets and post-retirement benefit plan assets in private market securities such as venture capital funds, private debt and private equity to
provide diversification and higher expected returns.

Outside
the United States, asset allocation decisions are typically made by an independent board of trustees. As in the U.S., investment objectives are aligned to generate returns that
will enable the plan
to meet its future obligations. In some countries local regulations require adjustments in asset allocation, typically leading to a higher percentage in fixed income than would otherwise be deployed.
HP's corporate office acts in a consulting and governance role in reviewing investment strategy and providing a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan, with final decisions on
asset allocation and investment managers made by local trustees.

Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term rate of return on assets for each U.S. plan reflects the expected returns for each major asset class
in which the plan invests and the weight of each asset class in the target mix.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 16: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans (Continued)

Expected
asset class returns reflect the current yield on U.S. government bonds and risk premiums for each asset class. Because HP's investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers
who seek to outperform the broader market, the asset class expected returns are adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns net of fees.

HP
closed the acquisition of EDS on August 26, 2008. Effective with the close of fiscal 2009, HP has merged the assets of the HP and EDS US pension plans after conducting an asset
allocation study for the combined plan. The expected return on the plan assets, used in calculating the net benefit costs, is 8% for fiscal 2010, which reflects the result of the most recent asset
allocation study and is commensurate with the investment strategy for the merged U.S. pension plan.

The
approach used to arrive at the expected rate of return on assets for the non-U.S. plans reflects the asset allocation policy of each plan and the expected country real
returns for equity and fixed income investments. On an annual basis, HP gathers empirical data from the local country subsidiaries to determine expected long-term rates of return for
equity and fixed income securities. HP then weights these expected real rates of return based on country specific allocation mixes adjusted for inflation.

Future Contributions and Funding Policy

In fiscal 2010, HP expects to contribute approximately $745 million to its pension plans and approximately $30 million to
cover benefit payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants. HP expects to pay approximately $45 million to cover benefit claims for HP's post-retirement benefit
plans. HP's funding policy is to contribute cash to its pension plans so that it meets at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government, funding and taxing
authorities.

Estimated Future Benefits Payable

HP estimates that the future benefits payable for the retirement and post-retirement plans in place were as follows at
October 31, 2009:

clauses. Rent expense was approximately $1,112 million in fiscal 2009, $935 million in fiscal 2008 and $767 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in fiscal 2009 rent
expense was primarily a result of the EDS acquisition in August 2008. Sublease rental income was approximately $53 million in fiscal 2009, $37 million in fiscal 2008 and
$44 million in fiscal 2007.

At
October 31, 2009, property under capital lease which was comprised primarily of equipment and furniture was approximately $723 million and was included in property,

Note 18: Litigation and Contingencies

HP is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities, employment, employee
benefits and environmental matters that arise in the ordinary course of business. HP records a provision for a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been
incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. HP believes it has adequate provisions for any such matters. HP reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these
provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case. Based on its experience, HP believes
that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters discussed below are not a meaningful indicator of HP's potential liability.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 18: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

Litigation
is inherently unpredictable. However, HP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Nevertheless, it is possible that cash flows or results of
operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies or because of the diversion of management's attention and the
creation of significant expenses.

Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations

Copyright levies

.

As described below, proceedings are ongoing against HP in certain European Union ("EU") member
countries, including litigation in Germany, seeking to impose levies upon equipment (such as multifunction devices ("MFDs"), personal computers ("PCs") and printers) and alleging that these devices
enable producing private copies of copyrighted materials. The total levies due, if imposed, would be based upon the number of products sold and the per-product amounts of the levies, which
vary. Some EU member countries that do not yet have levies on digital devices are expected to implement similar legislation to enable them to extend existing levy schemes, while some other EU member
countries are expected to limit the scope of levy schemes and applicability in the digital hardware environment. HP, other companies and various industry associations are opposing the extension of
levies to the digital environment and advocating alternative models of compensation to rights holders.

VerwertungsGesellschaft
Wort ("VG Wort"), a collection agency representing certain copyright holders, instituted non-binding arbitration proceedings against HP in June 2001
in Germany before the arbitration board of the Patent and Trademark Office. The proceedings relate to whether and to what extent copyright levies for photocopiers should be imposed in accordance with
copyright laws implemented in Germany on MFDs that allegedly enable the production of copies by private
persons. Following unsuccessful arbitration, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against HP in May 2004 in the Stuttgart Civil Court in Stuttgart, Germany seeking levies on certain MFDs sold from 1997 to 2001. On
December 22, 2004, the court held that HP is liable for payments regarding MFDs sold in Germany, and ordered HP to pay VG Wort an amount equal to 5% of the outstanding levies claimed, plus
interest, on MFDs sold in Germany up to December 2001. VG Wort appealed this decision. On July 6, 2005, the Stuttgart Court of Appeals ordered HP to pay VG Wort levies based on the published
tariffs for photocopiers in Germany (which range from EUR 38.35 to EUR 613.56 per unit), plus interest, on MFDs sold in Germany up to December 2001. HP appealed the Stuttgart Court of Appeals'
decision to the Bundesgerichtshof (the German Federal Supreme Court). On January 30, 2008, the German Federal Supreme Court held that the MFDs covered by this lawsuit were photocopiers within
the meaning of the German copyright law that was in effect until December 31, 2007, and, therefore, are subject to the levies on photocopiers established by that law. HP subsequently appealed
the decision by filing a claim with the German Federal Constitutional Court challenging that ruling and the application of conventional photocopier levies for MFDs sold in Germany up to December 2001.
On June 4, 2009, the German Constitutional Court declined to hear HP's appeal.

On
September 26, 2005, VG Wort filed an additional lawsuit against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court in Stuttgart, Germany seeking assurance of full payment of levies on MFD units
sold in Germany between 1997 and 2001, as well as for MFDs sold from 2002 onwards. On July 26, 2007, the court issued a decision following the ruling of the Stuttgart Court of Appeals with
respect to the initial VG Wort lawsuit as described above. HP appealed the decision. On March 25, 2009, the German Association for Information Technology, Telecommunications and New Media e.V.
entered into a



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 18: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

settlement
agreement with VG Wort and Verwertungsgesellschaft Bild-Kunst, another collection agency representing copyright holders ("VG Bild-Kunst"), that provides for the
payment of levies on MFDs sold from 2002 through 2007. The levies vary from approximately €13 to €307 per unit depending on the type of device, the date sold and the
copy speed and are subject to reduction if VG Wort or VG Bild-Kunst grants more favorable rates in the future to parties within Germany that are not covered by the settlement. HP has
acceded to the settlement and paid all amounts due thereunder.

In
July 2004, VG Wort filed a separate lawsuit against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court seeking levies on printers. On December 22, 2004, the court held that HP is liable for
payments regarding all printers using ASCII code sold in Germany but did not determine the amount payable per unit. HP appealed this decision in January 2005 to the Stuttgart Court of Appeals. On
May 11, 2005, the Stuttgart Court of Appeals issued a decision confirming that levies are due. On June 6, 2005, HP filed an appeal to the German Federal Supreme Court in Karlsruhe. On
December 6, 2007, the German Federal Supreme Court issued a judgment that printers are not subject to levies under the existing law. The court issued a written decision on January 25,
2008, and VG Wort subsequently filed an application with the German Federal Supreme Court under Section 321a of the German Code of Civil Procedure contending that the court did not consider
their arguments. On May 9, 2008, the German Federal Supreme Court denied VG Wort's application. In addition, VG Wort has appealed the decision by filing a claim with the German Federal
Constitutional Court challenging the ruling that printers are not subject to levies. HP and the industry association BITKOM have responded to VG Wort's claim.

In
September 2003, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against Fujitsu Siemens Computer GmbH ("FSC") in the Munich Civil Court in Munich, Germany seeking levies on PCs. This is an industry
test case in Germany, and HP has agreed not to object to the delay if VG Wort sues HP for such levies on PCs following a final decision against FSC. On December 23, 2004, the Munich Civil Court
held that PCs are subject to a levy and that FSC must pay 12 euros plus compound interest for each PC sold in Germany since March 2001. FSC appealed this decision in January 2005 to the Munich
Court of Appeals. On December 15, 2005, the Munich Court of Appeals affirmed the Munich Civil Court decision. FSC filed an appeal with the German Federal Supreme Court in February 2006. On
October 2, 2008, the German Federal Supreme Court issued a judgment that PCs were not photocopiers within the meaning of the German copyright law that was in effect until December 31,
2007 and, therefore, not subject to the levies on photocopiers established by that law. VG Wort has filed a claim with the German Federal Constitutional Court challenging that ruling. FSC and BITKOM
have responded to VG Wort's claim.

On
December 29, 2005, ZPU, a joint association of various German collection societies, instituted non-binding arbitration proceedings against HP before the arbitration
board of the Patent and Trademark Office demanding reporting of every PC sold by HP in Germany from January 2002 through December 2005 and seeking a levy of 18.42 euros plus tax for each PC
sold during that period. HP filed a notice of defense in connection with these proceedings in February 2006, and an arbitration hearing was held in December 2006. On July 31, 2007, the
arbitration board issued a ruling proposing a levy of 15 euros plus tax for each PC sold during that period. HP has rejected the ruling of the arbitration board, and the arbitration proceedings
have concluded. ZPU has filed a claim with the Munich Court of Appeals to which HP has responded. A hearing date has been set by the court for February 18, 2010.

Based

number of units impacted, the amount of levies imposed and the ability of HP to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.

Sky Subscribers Services Limited and British Sky Broadcasting Limited v. EDS and EDS Limited (UK)

is a
lawsuit filed on August 17, 2004 by Sky Subscribers Services Limited and British Sky Broadcasting Limited against Electronic Data Systems Corporation ("EDS"), a company that HP acquired in
August 2008, and EDS Limited (UK) ("EDS UK"), one of EDS's subsidiaries, alleging deceit, negligent misrepresentation, negligent misstatement and breach of contract. The claims arose out of a customer
relationship management project that was awarded to EDS in 2000, the principal objective of which was to develop a customer call center in Scotland. EDS's main role in the project was as systems
integrator. On November 12, 2004, EDS and EDS UK filed their defense and counterclaim denying the
claims and seeking damages for monies owed under the contract. The trial of this action commenced on October 15, 2007, and final arguments concluded on July 30, 2008. At trial, the
plaintiffs claimed damages in excess of £700 million, and EDS and EDS UK counterclaimed for damages of approximately £5 million. HP expects to receive a decision
from the court in January 2010.

Skold, et al. v. Intel Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company

is a lawsuit in which HP was joined on
June 14, 2004 that is pending in state court in Santa Clara County, California. The lawsuit alleges that HP (along with Intel) misled the public by suppressing and concealing the alleged
material fact that systems that use the Intel Pentium 4 processor are less powerful and slower than systems using the Intel Pentium III processor and processors made by a competitor of Intel. The
plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, restitution, attorneys' fees and costs, and certification of a nationwide class. On February 27, 2009, the court denied with prejudice plaintiffs' motion
for nationwide class certification for a third time. The plaintiffs have appealed the court's decision.

Inkjet Printer Litigation

.

As described below, HP is involved in several lawsuits claiming breach of express and implied
warranty, unjust enrichment, deceptive advertising and unfair business practices where the plaintiffs have alleged, among other things, that HP employed a "smart chip" in certain inkjet printing
products in order to register ink depletion prematurely and to render the cartridge unusable through a built-in expiration date that is hidden, not documented in marketing materials to
consumers, or both. The plaintiffs have also contended that consumers received false ink depletion warnings and that the smart chip limits the ability of consumers to use the cartridge to its full
capacity or to choose competitive products.

certification, restitution, declaratory relief, injunctive relief and unspecified statutory, compensatory and punitive damages. A class authorization hearing for one of the cases pending in Quebec was
tentatively scheduled for December 10, 2009; that hearing has been postponed and no new date has been set by the court.

Baggett v. HP

is a consumer class action filed against HP on June 6, 2007 in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California alleging that HP employs a technology in its LaserJet color printers whereby the printing process shuts down prematurely, thus preventing
customers from using the toner that is allegedly left in the cartridge. The plaintiffs also allege that HP fails to disclose to consumers that they will be unable to utilize the toner remaining in the
cartridge after the printer shuts down. The complaint seeks certification of a nationwide class of purchasers of all HP LaserJet color printers and seeks unspecified damages, restitution,
disgorgement, injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs. On September 29, 2009, the court granted HP's motion for summary judgment against the named plaintiff and denied plaintiff's motion
for class certification as moot. On November 3, 2009, the court entered judgment against the named plaintiff. On November 17, 2009, plaintiff filed an appeal of the court's summary

and text. The plaintiffs are seeking to certify a nationwide injunctive class and a California-only damages class. A class certification hearing is scheduled for February 5, 2010.

On
December 27, 2001,

filed a complaint, amended on September 6, 2002, against HP in United States District Court for the Northern District of
New York alleging that HP's PA-RISC 8000 family of microprocessors, and servers and workstations incorporating those processors, infringe a patent assigned to Cornell Research
Foundation, Inc. that describes a way of executing microprocessor instructions. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief and unspecified damages. The patent at issue in this
litigation, United States Patent No. 4,807,115, expired on February 21, 2006. Therefore, the plaintiffs are no longer entitled to seek injunctive relief against HP. This matter was tried
between May 19 and May 30, 2008, and, on May 30, 2008, a jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs in the amount of $184 million. On March 30, 2009, the
trial court issued four post-trial decisions. The court denied several of HP's post-trial motions, but granted HP's motion to reduce the damages award. The court reduced the
award to approximately $53 million and subsequently entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs in that amount. On April 10, 2009, HP filed a notice that it will appeal the judgment to
the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. On May 15, 2009, the court awarded approximately $17 million in pre-judgment interest and approximately
$1 million in costs and subsequently entered an

seeking unpaid overtime compensation and other damages based on allegations that various employees of EDS or HP have been misclassified as exempt employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and/or in
violation of the California Labor Code or other state laws:

•

Cunningham and Cunningham, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

is a purported collective action filed on May 10, 2006 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York claiming that current
and former EDS employees involved in installing and/or maintaining computer software and hardware were misclassified as exempt employees. Two other purported collective actions,

Steavens, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

, which was filed on October 23, 2007, and

Azar v. Electronic Data Systems Corporation

, which was filed on February 20, 2009, are also now pending
in the same
court alleging similar facts.

•

Heffelfinger, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

is a class action filed on November 2006 in California Superior Court claiming that certain EDS information technology workers in California were
misclassified exempt employees. The case was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, which, on January 7, 2008, certified a class of
information technology workers in California. On June 6, 2008, the court granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. Three other purported class actions originally filed in California Superior Court,

Jameson, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

, which was filed on July 16, 2008,

Karlbom, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

, which was filed on March 16, 2009, and

George, et al. v. Electronic Data Systems
Corporation

, which was filed on April 2, 2009, are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Central or Southern District of California alleging similar
facts.

•

Mathias v. Hewlett-Packard Company

is a
purported collective action filed on August 21, 2009 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Atlanta Division. The lawsuit alleges that Mathias represents
other similarly situated employees who were misclassified as exempt employees.

The United States of America, ex rel. Norman Rille and Neal Roberts v. Hewlett-Packard Company, et al.

In 2004,
two private individuals filed a civil "

qui tam

" complaint under the False Claims Act in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Arkansas containing generalized allegations that HP and several other companies participated in an industry-wide practice of using partnership and alliance programs to make improper
payments and cause the submission of false claims in connection with contracts to provide products and services to the federal government. On April 12, 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice
intervened in the

qui tam

action and filed a complaint against HP (and several other companies in separate actions) on behalf of the United States
containing allegations that HP violated the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 by providing millions of dollars in kickbacks to its alliance partners, including "influencer
fees" and "new business opportunity rebates." The U.S. complaint further alleges that HP violated the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Act, breached its federal government contracts,
induced the federal government to make payments to HP



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 18: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

that
HP was not entitled to receive under those contracts, and was unjustly enriched by expressly or impliedly making false statements, records or certifications to the federal government that it
complied with and would continue to comply with the Anti-Kickback Act and by submitting claims to the government that allegedly were inflated because they included the amounts of the
influencer fees and new business opportunity rebates. The U.S. complaint seeks treble damages plus civil penalties in connection with the alleged violations of the False Claims Act, double damages
plus civil penalties in connection with the alleged violations of the Anti-Kickback Act and disgorgement of profits earned in connection with the breach of contract and unjust enrichment
claims.

Leak Investigation Proceedings

.

As described below, HP is or has been the subject of various governmental inquiries
concerning the processes employed in an investigation into leaks of HP confidential information to members of the media that concluded in May 2006:

•

In August 2006, HP was informally contacted by the Attorney General of the State of California requesting information
concerning the processes employed in the leak investigation. On December 7, 2006, HP announced that it entered into an agreement with the California Attorney General to resolve civil claims
arising from the leak investigation, including a claim made by the California Attorney General in a Santa Clara County Superior Court action filed on December 7, 2006, that HP committed unfair
business practices under California law in connection with the leak investigation. As a result of this agreement, which includes an injunction, the California Attorney General will not pursue civil
claims against HP or its current and former directors, officers and employees. Under the terms of the agreement, HP paid a total of $14.5 million and agreed to implement and maintain for five
years a series of measures designed to ensure that HP's corporate investigations are conducted in accordance with California law and the company's high ethical standards. Of the $14.5 million,
$13.5 million has been used to create a Privacy and Piracy Fund to assist California prosecutors in investigating and prosecuting consumer privacy and information piracy violations, $650,000
was used to pay statutory damages and $350,000 reimbursed the California Attorney General's office for its investigation costs. There was no finding of liability against HP as part of the settlement.

•

Beginning in September 2006, HP received requests from the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the U.S. House of
Representatives (the "Committee") for records and information concerning the leak investigation, securities transactions by HP officers and directors, including an August 25, 2006, securities
transaction by Mark Hurd, HP's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related matters. HP has responded to those requests. In addition, Mr. Hurd voluntarily gave testimony to the Committee
regarding the leak investigation on September 28, 2006.

•

In September 2006, HP was informally contacted by the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting
similar information concerning the processes employed in the leak investigation. HP has responded to that request.

•

Beginning in September 2006, HP has received requests from the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange
Commission for records and information and interviews with current and former HP directors and officers relating to the leak investigation, the resignation of Thomas J. Perkins from HP's Board of
Directors, HP's May 22, 2006 and September 6, 2006 filings with the SEC on Form 8-K, stock repurchases by HP and securities transactions by its

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 18: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

officers
and directors that occurred between May 1 and October 1, 2006, and HP's policies, practices and approval of securities transactions. In May 2007, HP consented to the entry of an
order by the SEC ordering HP to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of the public reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. HP has been advised by
the staff of the Division of Enforcement that the staff has completed its investigation and does not intend to recommend that any other SEC enforcement action be brought in connection with these
matters.

•

In September 2006, HP received a request from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for records and information
relating to the processes employed in the leak investigation. HP has responded to that request.

In
addition, four stockholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in California purportedly on behalf of HP stockholders seeking to recover damages for alleged breach of fiduciary duty
and to require HP to improve its corporate governance and internal control procedures as a result of the activities of the leak investigation:

Staehr v. Dunn, et
al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 18, 2006;

Worsham v. Dunn, et
al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 14, 2006;

Tansey v. Dunn, et
al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 20, 2006; and

Hall v. Dunn, et
al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 25, 2006. On October 19, 2006, the Santa Clara County Superior Court consolidated
the four California cases under the caption

In re Hewlett-Packard Company Derivative Litigation

. The consolidated complaint
filed on November 19, 2006, also seeks to recover damages in connection with sales of HP stock alleged to have been made by certain current and former HP officers and directors while in
possession of material non-public information. Two additional stockholder derivative lawsuits,

Pifko v. Babbio, et
al.

, filed on September 19, 2006, and

Gross v. Babbio, et al.

, filed on
November 21, 2006, were filed in Chancery Court, County of New Castle, Delaware; both seek to recover damages for alleged breaches of fiduciary duty and to obtain an order instructing the
defendants to refrain from further breaches of fiduciary duty and to implement corrective measures that will prevent future occurrences of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. On January 24,
2007, the Delaware court consolidated the two cases under the caption

In re Hewlett-Packard Company Derivative Litigation

and subsequently stayed the proceedings, as the parties had reached a tentative settlement. The HP Board of Directors appointed a Special Litigation Committee consisting of independent Board members
authorized to investigate, review and evaluate the facts and circumstances asserted in these derivative matters and to determine how HP should proceed in these matters. On December 14, 2007, HP
and the plaintiffs in the California and Delaware derivative actions entered into an agreement to settle those lawsuits. Under the terms of the settlement, HP agreed to continue certain corporate
governance changes until December 31, 2012 and to pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. The California
court granted final approval to the settlement on March 11, 2008 and subsequently granted plaintiffs' counsel's fee application and dismissed the action. On June 12, 2008, the Delaware
court granted final approval to the settlement and the plaintiffs' application for attorneys' fees and also dismissed the action. Because neither the dismissal of the California nor the Delaware
derivative action was thereafter appealed, both cases are now concluded.



HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)

Note 18: Litigation and Contingencies (Continued)

Environmental

HP is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, including laws
addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites, the content of its products and the
recycling, treatment and disposal of its products including batteries. In particular, HP faces increasing complexity in its product design and procurement operations as it adjusts to new and future
requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of its products, their safe use, the energy consumption associated with those products and product take-back legislation. HP
could incur substantial costs, its products could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions, and it could face other sanctions, if it were to violate or become liable under environmental laws
or if its products become non-compliant with environmental laws. HP's potential exposure includes fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury
claims and clean up costs. The amount and timing of costs under environmental laws are difficult to predict.

HP
is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
("CERCLA"), known as "Superfund," or state laws similar to CERCLA. HP is also conducting environmental investigations or remediations at several current or former operating sites pursuant to
administrative orders or consent agreements with state environmental agencies.

HP
is also subject to legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for
specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). For example, the European Union
("EU") adopted the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive in January 2003. That directive makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible
for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. The EU member states were obliged to make producers participating in the market financially responsible
for implementing these responsibilities.

Segment Data

HP derives the results of the business segments directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting
policies HP uses to derive business segment results are substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. Management measures the performance of each business segment based on
several metrics, including earnings from operations. Management uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the business segments. HP does not
allocate to its business segments certain operating expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include primarily amortization of purchased intangible assets,
stock-based compensation expense related to HP-granted employee stock options, PRUs and the employee stock purchase plan, certain acquisition-related charges and charges for purchased
IPR&D, as well as certain corporate governance costs.

HP
does not allocate to its business segments restructuring charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions.

The businesses included in the former outsourcing services business unit were divided among the infrastructure technology outsourcing and business process outsourcing business units. The
infrastructure technology outsourcing, application services and business process outsourcing business units were added with the technology services business unit, and these four business units now
comprise the Services segment.

Certain
fiscal 2009 organizational reclassifications have been reflected retroactively to provide improved visibility and comparability. In
fiscal 2008 and 2007, the reclassifications resulted in the transfer of revenue among the Services, HP Software and Imaging and Printing Group financial reporting segments. In addition, revenue was
transferred among the business units within the Services, HP Software, Imaging and Printing Group, and Personal Systems Group segments. There was no impact on the previously reported financial results
for the Enterprise Storage and Servers, HP Financial Services and Corporate Investments segments.

completed fiscal quarter. Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that there has not been any change in our internal control over financial
reporting during that quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
