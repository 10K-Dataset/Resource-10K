PART I

ITEM 1. Business.

HP
is a leading global provider of products, technologies, solutions and services to individual consumers and businesses. Our offerings span information technology ("IT") infrastructure
and storage,
personal computing and other access devices, multi-vendor services including maintenance, consulting and integration and outsourcing, and imaging and printing. Our products and services are available
worldwide.

HP
was incorporated in 1947 under the laws of the State of California as the successor to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard. Effective in
May 1998, we changed our state of incorporation from California to Delaware. In May 2002 we acquired Compaq Computer Corporation ("Compaq"), which significantly expanded the breadth and
depth of our product offerings, increased our overall scale and reach, drove substantial improvements in our cost structure and generally improved our competitive position.

Our
business strategy revolves around the following strategic imperatives:

•

To provide customers with superior products, services and overall experiences by providing leading-edge technologies that work seamlessly
together.

We
seek to be a leader in each of the specific product and service categories in which we compete and to expand actively into new and adjacent markets. At the same time that we focus on individual
offerings, we seek to leverage the depth and breadth of our products, services and strategic partnerships to address new and emerging market demands by seamlessly integrating various products and
services that offer new customer experiences. We believe that these new experiences are shaped increasingly by customer demands for products and services that are digital, mobile, virtual and
personal, and we emphasize these as the foundation for our design.


By
leading these trends we seek both to expand our current businesses and to grow into new categories.

Digital

refers to the shift from analog, physical and labor-intensive tasks and processes, to computer-based formats. For example, in photography,
capturing and developing photos traditionally relied on chemistry, physical transportation and film canisters; the digital photography process does not have these requirements and restrictions, which
makes it more flexible, more productive and easier to use. Other processes continue similar shifts, creating new opportunities.

Mobile

refers to the fact that, because of the shift to digital technology, information is not tied to a particular physical location. People are able
and expect to access, exchange and respond to critical information and services anywhere, at any time, using myriad devices such as phones, hand-held computers, notebook computers and even GPS devices
in their cars.

Virtual

experiences substitute for experiences that require a human being present; they are carried on by means of computers. More and more processes
are becoming virtualized. For example, software can run an IT data center in the absence of a human IT manager, and video conferencing allows people to collaborate with others in a meeting thousands
of miles from their office.

Personal

preferences, information, style and biases increasingly dictate people's experience with technology. Individuals—whether consumers
or business people—are increasingly in control, demanding customized and highly personalized products, services and solutions to suit their tastes and needs. For example, digital
technology allows people to customize their television programming, music playlists, and even the settings of features in their cars.

•

To deliver to business customers the best return on IT investments in the industry

We
believe that, in addition to desiring leading technologies, customers also increasingly demand the most cost-effective solutions for their needs. We seek to address this requirement both through
our architectures and our sales processes. Our Adaptive Enterprise platform and our Smart Office initiative demonstrate our approach.

Our
Adaptive Enterprise platform, which is the name of our extended business infrastructure offering, leverages our portfolio to deliver enterprise-wide products and services emphasizing
standardization, virtualization, simplification, modularity and integration. We believe that designing with these principles provides the most cost-effective infrastructures that can
flexibly adapt to changing business dynamics.

Through
our Smart Office initiative, HP seeks to optimize the value small and medium business ("SMB") customers receive from their technology investments by pairing local and specialized expertise
from HP and its channel partners to help SMB customers plan, purchase and implement high quality technology solutions from across our businesses more effectively and efficiently.

•

To build world class cost structures and processes across our entire portfolio of businesses

We
believe that value is increasingly driven through horizontal processes, not vertical processes. Accordingly, we are focused on leveraging our scale to maximize purchasing efficiency and leveraging
our global footprint to maximize technical expertise and cost structure improvements available in different regions around the world. We also have created horizontal organizations to drive the
technology imperatives mentioned above across our businesses.


•

To focus our innovation and research and development

Our
approach to research and development is to make targeted investments in areas where we can make unique contributions and achieve differentiation while partnering with top providers in other areas
to enable us to provide our customers complete IT solutions.

HP Products and Services; Segment Information

During fiscal 2004, our operations were organized into seven business segments: the Personal Systems Group ("PSG"), the Imaging and Printing Group ("IPG"),
Enterprise Storage and Servers ("ESS"), HP Services ("HPS"), HP Financial Services ("HPFS"), Software and Corporate Investments. Given the cross-segment linkages in our Adaptive Enterprise offering,
and in order to capitalize on up-selling and cross-selling opportunities, ESS, HPS and Software are structured beneath a broader Technology Solutions Group ("TSG"). While TSG is not a
business segment, this aggregation provides a supplementary view of our business.

A
summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our business segments is found in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is
incorporated herein by reference. A discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Factors That Could Affect Future Results," in Item 7, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Technology Solutions Group

TSG's mission is to coordinate HP's Adaptive Enterprise offering across organizations to create solutions that allow customers to manage and transform their
business and IT environments. TSG allows us to leverage the resources and capabilities of our portfolio by applying key design principles consistently across business, application and infrastructure
services with a vision of standardization, simplification, modularity and integration. Each of the business segments within TSG is described in detail below.

Enterprise Storage and Servers

The server market continues to shift towards standards-based architectures as proprietary hardware and operating systems are being replaced by industry-standard
server platforms that typically offer compelling price/performance advantages by leveraging standards-based operating systems and microprocessor designs. At the same time, critical business functions
continue to demand particular scalability and reliability. By providing a broad portfolio of server and storage solutions, ESS aims to optimize the combined product solutions required by different
customers and provide solutions for a wide range of operating environments. In 2004, HP continued to ship more servers than any other vendor in the industry. ESS provides storage and server products
in a number of categories.

Business Critical Servers.

Business critical servers include Reduced Instruction Set Computing ("RISC")-based servers running
on the HP-UX operating system, Itanium®

(1)

- -based servers running on HP-UX, Windows®

(2)

and Linux and the HP AlphaServer product line running on both Tru64 UNIX®

(3)

and Open VMS. The various server offerings range from low-end servers to
high-end scalable servers, including the Superdome line. Additionally, HP offers its NonStop fault-tolerant server products for business critical solutions.

Industry Standard Servers.

Industry standard servers include primarily entry-level and mid-range ProLiant
servers, which run primarily on the Windows, Linux and Novell operating systems and leverage Intel- and AMD-based processors. The business spans a range of product lines that include pedestal-tower
servers, density-optimized servers and blade servers. HP's industry-standard server business continues to lead the industry in terms of units shipped and has a strong position in blade servers, the
fastest-growing segment of the market.

Storage.

HP's StorageWorks offerings include entry-level, mid-range and enterprise arrays, storage area networks,
network attached storage, storage management software and virtualization technologies, as well as tape drives, tape libraries and optical archival storage. HP's storage offerings continue to be
heavily weighted toward the tape drive and tape library markets.

HP Services

HPS provides a portfolio of multi-vendor IT services including technology services, consulting and integration, and managed services. HPS also offers a variety of
services tailored to particular industries such as manufacturing, network and service providers, financial services and government and education and services for the rest of the public sector. In
collaboration with ESS and Software, HPS teams with software and networking companies and local systems integrators to bring solutions to HP's customers. Although the largest segment of the overall
services market is in outsourcing, HPS is weighted more heavily towards Technology Services (formerly called Customer Support). However, Managed Services became a larger portion of HPS revenue as it
continued to grow at greater-than-market rates in fiscal 2004.

Technology Services.

HPS provides a range of technology services from standalone product support to high availability
services for complex, global, networked, multi-vendor environments. This business also manages the delivery of product warranty support through its own service organization, as well as through
authorized resellers.

Consulting and Integration.

HPS provides consulting and integration services that help customers measure, assess and maintain
the link between business and IT; design and integrate the customers' environments into a more adaptive infrastructure; and align, extend and manage applications and business processes. Consulting and
integration provides cross-industry solutions in areas such as supply chain, business portals, messaging and security.

Managed Services.

Managed services offers IT management services, including comprehensive outsourcing, transformational
infrastructure services, client computing managed services, managed web services, application services and business process outsourcing, as well as business continuity and recovery services.

Software

Software provides management software solutions, including support, that allow enterprise customers to manage their infrastructure, operations, applications and
business processes under the HP OpenView brand. In addition, Software delivers a suite of comprehensive, carrier-grade platforms for developing and deploying next-generation voice, data
and converged services to network and service providers under the HP OpenCall brand.

HP
is focused on extending its leadership position in network-management software into application and business process management. As part of this drive, HP has made targeted software
acquisitions that have integrated technology and functionality enhancements into the HP OpenView offerings and facilitated this extension. Having substantially integrated this new functionality,
Software is focused now on driving revenue growth with the enhanced products.


Personal Systems Group

PSG is one of the leading vendors of personal computers ("PCs") in the world based on unit volume shipped and annual revenue. PSG provides commercial PCs,
consumer PCs, workstations, handheld computing devices, digital entertainment systems, calculators and other related accessories, software and services for commercial and consumer markets. Like the
broader PC market, the PSG organization continues to experience a shift toward mobile products such as notebooks. Both commercial and consumer PCs are based predominately on the Windows operating
system and use Intel and AMD processors.

Commercial PCs.

PSG offers a variety of personal computers optimized for commercial uses, including enterprise and SMB
customers, and for connectivity and manageability in networked environments. These commercial PCs include the HP business desktops and the HP Compaq business series, as well as Evo notebook PCs and
Compaq Tablet PCs for mobile professionals.

Consumer PCs.

Consumer PCs include the HP Pavilion and Compaq Presario series of multi-media consumer desktop PCs and
notebook PCs, as well as HP Media Center PCs, and are targeted at the home user. In addition to optimizing configurations and value, PSG seeks to differentiate its products with distinguishing

Imaging and Printing Group

IPG is the leading imaging and printing systems provider in the world for printer hardware, printing supplies and scanning devices, providing solutions across
customer segments from individual consumers to small and medium businesses to large enterprises. IPG's products can be categorized generally as home and business printing, imaging and publishing
devices and systems, digital imaging products and printer supplies.

Printing and Imaging Devices and Systems.

Home and business printing, imaging and publishing devices and systems include
color and monochrome single-function printers for shared and personal use, printer- and copier-based multi-function devices, inkjet and laser all-in-one printers,
wide- and large-format inkjet printers and digital presses. Key initiatives in this area of IPG's business include


driving
color printing penetration in the office and continuing to expand further into high-end office imaging systems.

Digital Imaging.

An important part of IPG's strategy is to provide digital imaging solutions that rival traditional imaging
for quality, cost and ease of use so that consumers can manage their digital imaging at home. Digital imaging products include Photosmart printers, digital photography products and scanners. HP is
focused on driving a user-friendly experience across this range of products by ensuring compatibility and common user interfaces, where possible, and creating products that anticipate and address the
way in which consumers seek to use these technologies.

Supplies.

Printer supplies include laser and inkjet printer cartridges and other related printing media. These supplies
include HP-branded Vivera ink and HP Premium and Premium Plus photo papers, which together are designed to work as a system to produce faster prints with improved resistance to fading, increased print
quality and better affordability.

HP Financial Services

HPFS supports and enhances HP's global product and service solutions, providing a broad range of value-added financial life cycle management services. HPFS
enables our worldwide customers to acquire complete IT solutions, including hardware, software and services. The group offers leasing, financing, utility programs and asset recovery services, as well
as financial asset management services
for large global and enterprise customers. HPFS also provides an array of specialized financial services to SMB customers and education and government entities. HPFS offers innovative, customized and
flexible alternatives to balance unique customer cash flow, technology obsolescence and capacity needs.

Corporate Investments

Corporate Investments is managed by the Office of Strategy and Technology and includes Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, also known as HP Labs, and certain business
incubation projects. Revenue in this segment is attributable to the sale of certain network infrastructure products and, in particular, gigabit ethernet switch products that enhance computing and
enterprise solutions as well as the licensing of specific HP technology to third parties.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We continue to manage our business and report our financial results based on the principal business segments described above. However, we organize the marketing
and selling of our products and services separately according to customer and distribution types. Our customers are organized by consumer and commercial customer groups, and distribution is organized
by direct and channel. Within the channel, we have various types of partners that we utilize for various customer groups. The partners include the following:

•

retailers
that sell our products to the public through their own physical or internet stores;

•

resellers
that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customers groups;

•

distribution
partners that supply our solutions to smaller resellers with whom we do not have direct relationships;

•

independent
distributors that sell our products into geographies or customer segments in which we have a lesser presence;

•

original-equipment-manufacturers
("OEMs") that integrate our products with their own hardware or software and sell the integrated product;


•

independent
software vendors ("ISVs") that provide their clients with specialized software products that frequently drive additional products and services and often assist
us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products; and

•

systems
integrators that provide various expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often partner with HPS to extend their expertise or influence the
sale of our products and services.

The
balance of channel types varies by product category. For instance, we sell consumer PCs largely through the retail channel and IPG products are sold largely through consumer and
commercial channels, but customers also can purchase these products directly from HP. High-end commercial solutions generally are sold directly to customers, though lower-end
servers may be sold either through the channel or directly. We have distribution programs and incentive offerings for certain of our channel partners that include volume-based incentives, product
promotions, rebates, price-protection terms, and rights to return products. Information on how these programs impact our financial reporting can be found in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies—Revenue Recognition" in Item 7 and in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Management
of HP's overall consumer-related sales and marketing activities resides in IPG. Accordingly, IPG leads our cross-segment focus on integrated consumer products and digital
imaging and entertainment products in particular, as well as our annual consumer product launch for the back-to-school and holiday season. IPG also manages consumer channel relationships with
approximately 20,000 third-party retail locations for imaging and printing products, as well as other consumer products including consumer PCs, which provides for a bundled sale opportunity between
PCs and IPG products. In addition, IPG manages direct consumer sales through

www.hp.com

and through

www.hpshopping.com

, a wholly-owned subsidiary that
supports online sales.

A
cross-segment organization called the Customer Solutions Group ("CSG") manages commercial sales and marketing activities. HP created CSG in May 2004 in order to provide a single
organization to manage enterprise, SMB and public sector customer relationships, as well as to simplify sales processes across our segments to improve speed and effectiveness. Key CSG initiatives
during 2004 included a focus on improving the mix of skills in our sales force, enhancing the efficiency of bid desk requests by speeding up our ability to bid for business, and increasing the number
of higher-margin products and solutions sold by the sales force. CSG also oversees and coordinates sales and marketing activities for both volume-based business such as industry-standard servers and
value-based solutions such as Superdome. In this capacity, CSG manages our direct sales force and pre-sales technical consultants as well as our direct distribution activities for
commercial products and go-to-market activities with systems integrators and ISVs. PSG manages commercial reseller channels, due largely to the significant volume of commercial
PCs that HP sells through these channels.

In
addition to our separate consumer and commercial marketing and channel-management activities, we operate some cross-organizational efforts, such as our overall PartnerONE channel
incentive program, while the separate product groups manage some activities such as our OEM relationships.

Manufacturing and Materials

Our manufacturing operations consist of manufacturing finished products from components and sub-assemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors. In
addition to our own manufacturing operations, we utilize a number of contract manufacturing ("CM") companies around the world to manufacture HP-designed products. The use of CM companies
is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for certain HP-designed products. Third-party OEMs manufacture some HP-branded products that we purchase and
resell under the HP brand.


We
utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order ("BTO") and configuring products to order ("CTO"). We employ BTO capabilities to maximize
manufacturing efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. CTO permits configuration of units to the particular hardware and software customization requirements of certain
customers. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both BTO and CTO seek to minimize inventory holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to
the sale or distribution of products to our customers.

We
purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For many of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such sources
are readily
available. However, we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines and parts for products with short life cycles (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations). We are
dependent upon Intel as a supplier of processors and static random access memory (RAM) and Microsoft for various software products. However, we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would
result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors.

Like
other participants in the high technology industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our
requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we have experienced significant price increases and limited availability of certain components that are not available from
multiple sources. Frequently, we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an impact on gross margin but does not disrupt production. On
occasion, we acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with vendors to improve the priority and availability of supply. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors that Could Affect Future Results—We depend on third party suppliers, and our
revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly" in Item 7, which is incorporated herein by reference.

International

Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and
enterprise customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams to
offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to exploit new markets for maturing products. In addition, we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop
products and sales models that target developing countries. In this regard, we believe that our broad geographic presence and our e-Inclusion program, which is focused on developing
products and business models that will bring technology to developing countries, will give us a solid base to build upon for such future growth.

A
summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property, plant and equipment is set forth in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is
incorporated herein by reference. Over 60% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2004 came from outside of the United States. A majority of our net revenue originating outside the United States was
from customers other than foreign governments.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to HP's foreign operations, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors That Could
Affect Future Results—Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial
condition" in Item 7, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk" in Item 7A and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are
incorporated herein by reference.


Research and Development

Our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products, services and solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires and
emerging technological trends. Our efforts are also focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology
companies will maximize our cost structure and our customers' experiences. Key research focus areas include:

•

Next-generation computing:

Using industry-standard components to develop an adaptive IT infrastructure that automatically and
securely moves, balances, shares and reuses computing resources as needed.

•

Imaging and printing growth:

Expanding HP technologies into new areas, such as commercial printing; developing smarter
cameras, video projectors, 3D imaging, enhanced device connectivity and other technologies for innovative imaging applications.

•

Industry collaborations:

Developing solutions for customers in fields undergoing rapid change, such as mobile devices and
infrastructure for life sciences and education.

•

Technologies for services:

Developing architecture, tools, platforms and software in the areas of adaptive infrastructure and
services, as well as creating platforms, services and solutions that provide end-to-end security.

•

Consumer systems:

Creating architectures that enable systems and devices to work better together, including developing and
driving open, cross-industry standards.

•

Emerging and transformative technologies:

Continuing to push the boundaries of science in areas such as the development of
nanoscale molecular computing and flexible displays as well as designing product features targeted at making technology affordable and useful for customers in emerging markets.

HP
Labs, together with the various research and development groups within the five principal business segments, are responsible for our research and development efforts. HP Labs is part
of our Corporate Investments segment.

Expenditures
for research and development in fiscal 2004 were $3.5 billion, as compared to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2003 and $3.4 billion in fiscal 2002. We anticipate
that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services to maintain and
enhance our competitive position.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Factors That Could Affect Future Results—If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for
innovation and quality, our revenue may suffer" in Item 7, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Patents

Our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where
proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At October 31, 2004, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 25,000 patents, a significant increase over the 21,000 patents we
held at the end of fiscal 2003. Of these 25,000 patents, approximately 9,000 are related to IPG, with approximately 4,000 of the IPG patents related to our supplies business.

Patents
generally have a term of twenty years. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms on the individual patents vary. While we believe that our patents and
applications are


important
for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and maximizing our return on research and development investments, no single patent is in itself essential to us as a whole or
any of our principal business segments.

In
addition to developing our patents, we license intellectual property from third parties where we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses under
patents owned by us when we consider these arrangements to be in our interests. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors that
Could Affect Future Results—Our revenue, cost of sales, and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends
or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights" in Item 7, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the large volume of products delivered from shelf or channel partner
inventories, the shortening of product life cycles and the relative portion of net revenue related to our service and support businesses. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material
to an understanding of our overall business.

Seasonality

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our products experience weak
economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, sales to governments (particularly sales to the U.S.
government) often are stronger in the third calendar quarter, European sales often are weaker in the summer months, and consumer sales often are stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand during
the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors that Could Affect Future Results—Our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future
financial results less predictable" in Item 7, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Competition

We encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality,
reliability, brand, distribution, range of products and services, account relationships, customer service and support, security and availability of application software. Our reputation, the ease of
use of our products, the availability of multiple software applications, our Internet infrastructure offerings, and our customer training, services and support are also important competitive factors.

The
markets for each of our business segments are characterized by vigorous competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and
rapidly growing firms. Product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete
effectively on the basis of the factors listed above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEM that design, manufacture and often market their products
under their own brand names. The successful management of these competitive partner relationships will continue to be critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to
continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.


On
an overall basis we are among the largest U.S.-based companies offering our range of general purpose computers and personal information, imaging and printing products for industrial,
scientific and business applications, and IT services. We are the leader or among the leaders in each of our principal business segments.

The
competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below:

Personal Systems Group.

The areas in which PSG operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid price
reductions and inventory depreciation. Our primary competitor in the branded personal computers area is Dell Inc ("Dell"), with additional competition, particularly in niche markets, from companies
such as Toshiba Corporation, Apple Computer Inc., International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), which has announced its intention to sell a majority stake in this business to the
China-based Lenovo Group (formerly known as Legend), and the merged businesses of
Gateway, Inc and eMachines. In particular regions, we also experience competition from companies such as Acer Inc. and Fujitsu Limited, both of which are particularly strong in Europe, and the
Lenovo Group, which is particularly strong in China. We also face competition from generically-branded or "white box" manufacturers.

Imaging and Printing Group.

The markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive, especially with
respect to pricing and the introduction of new products and features. IPG's key competitors include Lexmark International Group Inc., Xerox Corporation ("Xerox"), Seiko Epson Corporation, Sony
Corporation of America, Canon USA, Inc. and Dell as a reseller of printer products. We are the leading imaging and printing systems provider in the world for printer hardware, printing supplies
and scanning devices. We believe that our brand recognition, reputation for quality, breadth of product offerings and large customer base are important competitive advantages. We and our competitors
continue to develop and market new and innovative products at competitive prices and, at any given time, may set new market standards for quality, speed and function. In recent years, we and our
principal competitors have regularly lowered prices on printer hardware to reach new customers and add customer value. In addition, refill and remanufactured alternatives for our supplies are
available from independent suppliers and, although generally offering lower print quality, may be offered at lower prices and put pressure on our supplies sales and margins. Three important areas for
our growth include home management of digital imaging and printing, multi-function printers in the office space and digital presses in our digital publishing business. While we encounter competitors
whose current market share is greater than ours, such as Xerox in copiers and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft in publishing, we believe we will provide important new contributions in
both the home and publishing environments by providing comprehensive solutions.

Enterprise Storage and Servers.

The areas in which ESS operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid and
ongoing technological innovation and price reductions. Our competitors range from broad solutions providers such as IBM to more focused competitors such as EMC Corporation in storage, Dell in industry
standard servers, and Sun Microsystems, Inc. in Unix-based servers. Broad-based solutions providers benefit from their existing customer base and the breadth of their product offerings, while
more focused competitors are able to concentrate their efforts on providing the most competitive product. We believe that our important competitive advantages in this segment include our broad range
of server and storage products and related services, our global reach and our significant intellectual property portfolio and research and development capabilities, which will contribute to further
enhancements of our product offerings.

HP Services.

The principal areas in which HPS competes are technology services, consulting and integration and managed
services. The support and consulting and integration markets have been under significant pressure as customers scrutinize their IT spending. However, this trend has benefited the managed services
business as customers attempt to reduce their IT costs and focus their resources on their core businesses. Our key competitors in this segment include IBM Global Services and the


services
businesses of other technology products organizations, as well as EDS Corporation and other systems integration firms. Many of our competitors are able to offer a wide range of services
through a global network of service providers, and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition. HPS teams with many services companies to extend our reach and augment our capabilities.
Our competitive advantages include our global delivery organization, with a worldwide presence; our deep technical expertise; our diagnostic and IT management tools; and the flexibility and choice we
offer our customers.

Software.

Our software competitors include other companies focused on providing software solutions for IT management, such as
BMC Software Inc, Computer Associates International Inc., Veritas Software (which has agreed to merge with Symantec Corp.) and Mercury Interactive, as well as broad enterprise IT companies such
as IBM.

HP Financial Services.

In our financing business, our competitors are captive financing companies, mainly IBM Global
Financing, banks and financial institutions. We believe our competitive advantage in this business over banks and financial institutions is our ability to finance products, services and total
solutions.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to these competitive factors, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors That
Could Affect Future Results—The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margin and prospects" in Item 7, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Environment

Certain of our operations involve the use of substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws relating to the environment,
including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Many of our products
are subject to various federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in products, including those regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and
those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party damage or
personal injury claims if we were to violate or become
liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws. We also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new
and upcoming requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances in electronics that will apply to specified electronics
products put on the market in the European Union as of July 1, 2006 (Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive) and similar legislation currently
proposed for China. In addition, we also could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. The European Union has finalized the Waste
Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, which makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and
disposal of past and future covered products. The deadline for enacting and implementing this directive by individual European Union governments was August 13, 2004 (such legislation, together
with the directive, the "WEEE Legislation"), although extensions were granted in some countries. Producers are to be financially responsible under the WEEE Legislation beginning in August 2005.
Similar legislation may be enacted in other geographies, including federal and state legislation in the United States, the cumulative impact of which could be significant.

It
is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside and outside the United States, even if we are not subject to regulations imposed by local
governments. The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when HP considers it probable


and
can reasonably estimate the costs. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations or financial position, and we do not currently anticipate material capital
expenditures for environmental control facilities.

ITEM 2. Properties.

As of October 31, 2004, we owned or leased a total of approximately 69 million square feet of space worldwide. We believe that our existing
properties are in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business.

We
anticipate that we will continue to obtain most of the capital necessary for expansion from internally generated funds. Investment in new property, plant and equipment amounted to
approximately $2.1 billion in fiscal 2004, $2.0 billion in fiscal 2003 and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2002.

As
of October 31, 2004, our sales and support operations occupied approximately 17 million square feet, of which approximately 4 million square feet were located
within the United States. We own 38% of the space used for sales and support activities and lease the remaining 62%.

Our
manufacturing plants, research and development facilities and warehouse and administrative facilities occupied approximately 52 million square feet, of which approximately
33 million square feet were located within the United States. We own 61% of our manufacturing, research and development, warehouse and administrative space and lease the remaining 39%. Our
plants are equipped with machinery, most of which we own and which, in part, we developed to meet the special requirements of our manufacturing processes. At the end of fiscal 2004, we were
productively utilizing the majority of the space in our facilities, while actively disposing of space we determined to be excess.

The
property we own is not subject to any material encumbrances.

As
indicated above, we have seven business segments: PSG, IPG, ESS, HPS, HPFS, Software and Corporate Investments. Because of the interrelation of these segments, a majority of these
segments use substantially all of the properties at least in part, and we retain the flexibility to use each of the properties in whole or in part for each of the segments.

Our
principal executive offices, including global headquarters, are located at 3000 Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California, United States of America. The locations of our headquarters of
geographic operations at October 31, 2004 were as follows:

ITEM 3. Legal Proceedings.

Pending Litigation and Proceedings

Intergraph Hardware Technologies Company v. HP, Dell & Gateway

is a lawsuit filed in United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall County, on December 16, 2002. Gateway and Dell are no longer defendants in this matter. The suit accuses HP of infringement of three
patents related to cache memory (the "Clipper Patents"). Intergraph Hardware Technologies Company ("Intergraph") seeks damages constituting a "reasonable royalty" (as well as enhanced damages), an
injunction, prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees. The complaint was served on HP on April 1, 2003. On May 21, 2003, HP answered and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment
that the patents are not infringed by HP and that the patents are invalid and unenforceable. Fact discovery closed on October 27, 2004. A claim construction hearing was held on May 7,
2004, and the court issued a ruling on the claim construction hearing on July 1, 2004. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on February 7, 2005, and trial is scheduled to begin on
February 21, 2005. Expert discovery is ongoing. On May 7, 2004, Intergraph sued HP in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler County, for infringement of
another patent related to cache memory management. Intergraph seeks an injunction, declaratory relief and attorneys' fees, but not damages. HP answered and counterclaimed,


asserting
Intergraph's infringement of two HP software patents. HP seeks damages and an injunction. Trial in that matter is scheduled to begin on April 11, 2005 for Intergraph's claims, and on
October 24, 2005 for HP's claims. Intergraph has obtained significant settlements from other defendants, ranging from $10 million (Advanced Micro Devices) to $300 million (Intel
Corporation), relating to such defendants' direct use of the Clipper Patents. However, the ultimate resolution of these proceedings and the financial impact on HP, which will depend in part on
determinations as to the useful life of the patents, what would constitute "reasonable royalty" rates, the allocation of any amounts paid for accounting purposes, the timing of any payments and the
units impacted, remains uncertain.

On
May 28, 2003, HP sued Intergraph Corporation, the parent of Intergraph, in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division,
accusing Intergraph Corporation of infringement of four HP patents related to computer-aided design, video display technology and information retrieval technology. Intergraph answered and
counterclaimed for declaratory relief on October 14, 2003. A claim construction hearing was held on October 22, 2004, and the court issued its claim construction rulings on
January 3, 2005. HP expects trial to begin in mid-2005. HP seeks damages, an injunction, prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees. On April 1, 2004, HP sued Intergraph
Corporation in the Mannheim State Court in Mannheim, Germany, and related proceedings in Germany are pending, for infringement of two European Union patents related to computer-aided design. HP seeks
damages, an injunction and costs. Trial took place in November 2004, and the court dismissed HP's action based on a determination of Intergraph's noninfringement on January 7, 2005. On
April 19, 2004, HP sued Z/I Imaging, a subsidiary of Intergraph Corporation, and Intergraph Corporation, in United States District Court for the District of Delaware, accusing Z/I Imaging of
infringement of two patents related to image scanning technology. Intergraph answered and counterclaimed for declaratory relief on May 28, 2004. Trial is scheduled to begin on
December 4, 2005. Also on April 19, 2004, HP sued Intergraph Corporation in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for infringement of one patent relating to
computer-aided design. Intergraph answered and counterclaimed for declaratory relief on May 13, 2004. Jury selection is expected to begin in December 2005. In both cases, HP seeks
damages, an injunction, prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees.

Copyright levies.

Proceedings are being pursued against HP in certain European Union ("EU") member
countries seeking to impose levies upon equipment (such as printers and multi-function devices) alleging that these devices enable producing private copies of copyrighted materials.

Two
non-binding arbitration proceedings instituted in June 2001 and June 2002, respectively, were brought in Germany before the arbitration board of the Patent
and Trademark Office. VerwertungsGesellschaft Wort ("VG Wort"), a collection agency representing certain copyright holders, brought the proceedings against HP, which relate to whether and to what
extent copyright levies should be imposed in accordance with copyright laws implemented in Germany relating to multi-function devices and printers that allegedly enable the production of copies by
private persons. The published tariffs on these devices in Germany range from 10 to 613.56 euros per unit. Non-binding proposals were presented in the proceedings, both of which HP
rejected. In May 2004, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court in Stuttgart, Germany seeking levies on multi-function devices ("MFDs"). A decision in this matter was
issued on December 22, 2004. The court held that HP is liable for payments regarding photocopiers sold in Germany, but did not determine the exact amount payable per unit. The court further
stated that HP should furnish information regarding the number of MFDs sold in Germany up to December 2001 and the number of copies per minute that various MFDs can produce. Finally, the court
held that a levy of a maximum of 1.5% of the price was due on the bundle "LJ8150 MFP plus Scanner-Module C4166B," and that the individual elements of this bundle were not part of the claim. The
deadline for filing an appeal of this decision is January 31, 2005. In July 2004, VG Wort filed a separate lawsuit against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court seeking levies on printers. A
decision in this matter was issued on December 22, 2004. The court held that HP is liable


for
payments regarding all printers using ASCII code sold in Germany, but did not determine the amount payable per unit. The court further stated that HP should furnish information regarding the
number of printers sold in Germany since April 2001 and the number of copies per minute that various printers can produce. The deadline for filing an appeal of this decision is
January 27, 2005. In September 2003, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against Fujitsu Siemens Computer GmbH ("FSC") in Munich State Court seeking levies on PCs. This is an industry test case in
Germany, and HP has undertaken to be bound by a final decision. A decision in this matter was issued on December 23, 2004 stating that PCs are subject to a levy and that FSC should furnish
information as to the number of PCs sold in Germany since January 1, 2001. Further, FSC must pay 12 euros plus compound interest for each PC sold in Germany from March 24, 2001. FSC has
indicated that it will appeal the decision.

In
April 2001, the Organization for the Collective Management of Works of Literature, the Organization for the Collective Management of Works of Plastic Arts and their
Applications, and the Organization for the Collective Management and Protection of Intellectual Property of Photographers brought five proceedings against HP Hellas EPE and Compaq Computer EPE in
Greece relating to whether a levy of 2% should be payable upon computer products, including central processing units, monitors, keyboards, mice, diskettes, printers, scanners and related items in
accordance with Greek copyright law, before its amendment in September 2002. These proceedings are pending before the Court of First Instance of Athens or before the Court of Appeal of Athens.

In
April 1998, Auvibel s.c.r.l., a Belgian collection agency, filed an appeal of a judgment in HP's favor with the Court of Appeal in Brussels relating to a dispute as to whether
and to what extent copyright levies should be imposed upon CD-writers and CD media. The case has been removed from the court's list of pending cases, without prejudice to the parties'
right to reinstate the matter.

The
total levies due, if imposed, would be based upon the number of products sold, and the per-product amounts of the levies, which will vary. Some EU member countries that
do not yet have levies on digital devices are expected to implement similar legislation to enable them to extend existing levy schemes, while some other EU member countries are expected to limit the
scope of levy schemes and applicability in the digital hardware environment. HP, other companies and various industry associations are opposing the extension of levies to the digital environment and
advocating compensation to rights holders through digital rights management systems. Based on such opposition, HP's assessments of the merits of various proceedings and HP's estimates of the units
impacted and levies, HP has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the matters described above. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters, including the number of units
impacted, the amount of levies imposed in various jurisdictions and the availability of HP to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.

Alvis v. HP

is a nationwide defective product consumer class action that was filed in state court in
Jefferson County, Texas by a resident of Eastern Texas in April 2001. In February 2000, a similar suit captioned

LaPray v.
Compaq

was filed in state court in Jefferson County, Texas. The basic allegation is that HP and Compaq sold computers containing floppy disk controllers that
fail to alert the user to certain floppy disk controller errors. That failure is alleged to result in data loss or data corruption. The complaints in

Alvis

and

LaPray

seek injunctive relief,
declaratory relief, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. In July 2001, a nationwide class was certified in the

LaPray

case, which the Beaumont Court of Appeals affirmed in
June 2002. In May 2004, the Texas Supreme Court
reversed the certification of the nationwide class in the

LaPray

case and remanded the case to the trial court. The trial
court has not set a new class certification hearing. A class certification hearing was held on July 1, 2003 in the

Alvis

case, and the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a
nationwide class action. HP filed an appeal of that
certification with the 9th Court of Appeals in Beaumont, Texas, which heard oral arguments on HP's appeal and received a supplemental briefing based upon the

LaPray

opinion from the Texas Supreme
Court. On August 31, 2004, the 9th Court of Appeals in Texas reversed the
lower court's decision certifying a nationwide class and remanded the case to the trial court. A class


certification
hearing was held on January 6, 2005. On January 12, the court notified the parties that it will certify a Texas-wide class action for injunctive relief only. On
June 4, 2003,

Barrett v. HP

and

Grider v.
Compaq

were each filed in state court in Cleveland County, Oklahoma, with factual allegations similar to those in

Alvis

and

LaPray

. The complaints in

Barrett

and

Grider

seek, among other things,
specific performance, declaratory relief, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. On November 5, 2003, the court heard HP's motion to dismiss

Barrett v.
HP

and

Grider v. Compaq

, which motion was subsequently denied. On
December 22, 2003, the court entered an order staying both the

Barrett

and

Grider

cases until the conclusions of the

Alvis

and

LaPray

actions. On July 28,
2004, the Court lifted the stay in

Grider

, but took under advisement the plaintiff's motion to lift the stay in

Barrett

. On November 5,
2004,

Scott v.
HP

was filed in state court in San Joaquin County, California, with factual allegations similar to those in

Alvis

and

LaPray

. The complaint in

Scott

seeks class certification, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (including punitive damages), restitution, costs
and attorneys' fees. In addition, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, the General Services Administration Office of Inspector General and other Federal agencies are conducting an
investigation of allegations that HP and Compaq made or caused to be made false claims for payment to the United States for computers known by HP and Compaq to contain defective parts or otherwise to
perform in a defective manner relating to the same alleged floppy disk controller errors. HP agreed with the Department of Justice to extend the statute of limitations on its investigation until
June 6, 2005. HP is cooperating fully with this investigation.

On
December 27, 2001,

Cornell University and the Cornell Research Foundation, Inc.

filed an
action against HP in United States District Court for the Northern District of New York alleging that HP's PA-RISC 8000 family of microprocessors, and servers and workstations
incorporating those processors, infringe a patent assigned to Cornell Research Foundation, Inc. that describes a way of executing microprocessor instructions. HP has answered and counterclaimed. This
action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and unspecified damages. On March 26, 2004, the court issued a ruling interpreting the disputed claim terms in the patent at issue. Discovery is
ongoing, and no trial date has been set.

HP v. EMC Corporation

("EMC") is a lawsuit filed in United States District Court for the Northern District of
California on September 30, 2002, in which HP accuses EMC of infringing seven HP patents. HP seeks damages, an injunction, prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees. On July 21,
2003, EMC filed its answer and a cross-claim asserting, among other things, that numerous HP storage, server and printer products infringe six EMC patents. EMC seeks a permanent injunction as well as
unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys' fees for patent infringement. The court issued an order construing disputed claim terms on June 23, 2004. Discovery is ongoing. Trial is
expected in late 2005 or early 2006. On November 27, 2004, HP filed a second lawsuit in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in which HP accuses additional
models of certain EMC products of infringing the same seven HP patents. HP seeks damages, an injunction, prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees. EMC also filed suit against StorageApps, a
company acquired by HP in fiscal 2001, in United States District Court in Worcester, Massachusetts on October 20, 2000. The suit accused StorageApps of infringement of EMC patents relating to
storage devices, and sought a permanent injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. The court held a hearing to construe the disputed claims terms of EMC's three
patents in the suit on July 21-22, 2003 and issued its claim construction ruling on September 12, 2003. Following a trial in May 2004, the jury found that three of
EMC's patents are valid and infringed. The damages phase of the litigation has commenced, and a trial on the issue of damages is scheduled to begin on February 17, 2005. HP is appealing the
judgment of liability.

Neubauer, et al. v. Intel Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, et al.

and

Neubauer, et al. v. Compaq Computer
Corporation

are separate lawsuits filed on June 3, 2002 in state court in
Madison County, Illinois, alleging that HP and Compaq (along with Intel) misled the public by suppressing and concealing the alleged material fact that systems that use the Intel Pentium 4 processor
are less


powerful
and slower than systems using the Intel Pentium III processor and processors made by a competitor of Intel. The court in the HP action has certified an Illinois class as to Intel but denied a
nationwide class. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, restitution, attorneys' fees and costs and certification of a nationwide class against HP and Compaq. The class action certification hearings
against HP and Compaq have not yet been scheduled. In each action, HP and Compaq have filed motions to dismiss the cases, which the court has denied. HP and Compaq also have filed forum non conveniens
motions, which are pending.

Skold, et al. v. Intel Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company

is a lawsuit in state court in
Alameda County, California to which HP was joined on June 14, 2004, based upon factual allegations similar to those in the

Neubauer

cases. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages,
restitution, attorneys' fees and cost and certification of
nationwide class.

Forgent Networks v. HP et al.

is a lawsuit filed on April 22, 2004 against HP as well as 30 other
companies in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint accuses HP of patent infringement with respect to HP's products that implement JPEG compression. JPEG is a
standard for data compression used in HP's PCs, scanners, digital cameras, PDAs, and non-photo-printers. Forgent seeks unspecified damages, an injunction, interest, costs and attorneys'
fees. Separately, HP has alerted government regulators of Forgent's participation in the JPEG standardization process and current licensing activities. Trial has been set for October 2005.

Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP v. Gateway, Inc.

is a lawsuit filed on March 24, 2004
by HP's wholly-owned subsidiary, Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP ("HPDC"), against Gateway, Inc. in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of California, alleging infringement of
six patents relating to various notebook, desktop and enterprise computer technologies. On April 2, 2004, HPDC filed an amended complaint, adding infringement allegations for four additional
patents. HPDC seeks an injunction, unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys' fees. On May 10, 2004, Gateway filed an answer and a counterclaim, alleging infringement of five Gateway
patents relating to computerized television, wireless, computer monitoring and computer expansion card technologies. Gateway seeks an injunction, unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys'
fees. Claim construction is scheduled to begin on January 24-25, 2005. On May 6, 2004, HPDC and HP filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") against Gateway,
alleging infringement of seven additional computer technology patents. HP seeks an injunction. On October 21, 2004, HPDC filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District
of Wisconsin against eMachines, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gateway, alleging infringement of five HPDC patents relating to personal and desktop computers, of which three patents remain in suit. HPDC
seeks an injunction, unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys' fees.

On
July 2, 2004, Gateway filed a complaint with the ITC against HP, alleging infringement of three patents relating to audio control, imaging and computerized television
technologies. Gateway seeks an injunction. Claim construction is scheduled to begin on February 10-11, 2005. Also on July 2, 2004, Amiga Development LLC ("Amiga"), an entity affiliated
with Gateway, filed a lawsuit against HP in the Eastern District of Texas, alleging infringement of three patents relating to computer monitoring, imaging and decoder technologies. Gateway seeks an
injunction, unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys' fees. HP and HPDC have answered and counterclaimed, alleging infringement by Amiga and Gateway of four HPDC patents related to
personal computer technology. On August 18, 2004, Gateway filed a declaratory relief action against HPDC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California seeking a
declaration of non-infringement and invalidity of the above-referenced four HPDC patents relating to personal computer technology. HPDC answered and counterclaimed and alleged infringement of the same
four patents. HP seeks an injunction, unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys' fees. Claim construction is scheduled to begin in January 2005.


Hanrahan v. Hewlett-Packard Company and Carleton Fiorina

is a lawsuit filed on November 3, 2003, in
the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on behalf of a putative class of persons who sold common stock of HP during the period from September 4, 2001 through
November 5, 2001. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and generally alleges that HP and Ms. Fiorina violated the federal securities laws by making statements during this period which
were misleading in failing to disclose that Walter B. Hewlett would oppose the proposed acquisition of Compaq by HP prior to Mr. Hewlett's disclosure of his opposition to the proposed
transaction. A motion to transfer the action to federal court in California is pending, and no lead plaintiff has yet been appointed.

Stevens v. HP

(renamed as

Erickson v.
HP

) is an unfair business practices consumer class action filed in the Superior Court of California in Riverside County on July 31, 2000. Consumer class
action lawsuits
have been filed, in coordination with the original plaintiffs, in 33 additional jurisdictions. The various plaintiffs throughout the country claim to have purchased different models of HP inkjet
printers. The basic factual allegation of these actions is that affected consumers who purchased HP printers received half-full or "economy" ink cartridges instead of full cartridges.
Plaintiffs claim that HP's advertising, packaging and marketing representations for the printers led the consumers to believe they would receive full cartridges. These actions seek injunctive relief,
disgorgement of profits, compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees under various state unfair business practices statutes and common law claims of fraud and negligent
misrepresentation. In the initial California matter, the court granted summary judgment in HP's favor and denied class certification. In October of 2003, the California appellate court affirmed the
lower court's decisions and dismissed plaintiff's appeal. The matter was certified as a class action in North Carolina state court, where it was filed as

Hughes
v. Hewlett-Packard Company

. HP prevailed at the trial of this case, which concluded in September 2003. The litigation is not in trial in other
jurisdictions, and the other cases have not been certified as class actions. Plaintiffs' counsel in all 33 jurisdictions have signed a dismissal agreement, which provides that all of the cases will be
dismissed. Thus far twenty-one of the actions have been dismissed.

Digwamaje et al. v. Bank of America et al.

is a purported class action lawsuit that names HP and numerous
other multinational corporations as defendants. It was filed on September 27, 2002 in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of current and former South
African citizens and their survivors who suffered violence and oppression under the apartheid regime. The lawsuit alleges that HP and other companies helped perpetuate, and profited from, the
apartheid regime during the period from 1948-1994 by selling products and services to agencies of the South African government. Claims are based on the Alien Tort Claims Act, the Torture
Protection Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and state law. The complaint seeks, among other things, an accounting, the creation of a historic commission, compensatory
damages in excess of $200 billion, punitive damages in excess of $200 billion, costs and attorneys' fees. On November 29, 2004, the court dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint. On
December 23, 2004, the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

In
May 2002, the European Commission of the EU publicly stated that it was considering conducting an investigation into OEM activities concerning the sales of printers and
supplies to consumers within the EU. The European Commission contacted HP requesting information on the printing systems businesses. HP is cooperating fully with this inquiry.

In
March 2003, the Korea Fair Trade Commission commenced an investigation of the Korean printing and supplies market. The Korea Fair Trade Commission contacted HP requesting
information on its printing systems business. A hearing is expected to be held in 2005. HP is cooperating fully with this inquiry.


The
Government of Canada conducted cost audits of certain contracts between Public Works and Government Services Canada ("PWGSC") and each of Compaq Canada Corp. and Hewlett-Packard
(Canada) Co. relating to services provided to the Canadian Department of National Defence ("DND"). Compaq Canada Corp. was combined with Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Co. following HP's acquisition of
Compaq. HP cooperated fully with the audit and has conducted its own inquiry, sharing the results of its investigation with PWGSC and DND. On May 14, 2004, HP announced that it had resolved the
dispute with the Government of Canada. HP Canada agreed to reimburse the Government of Canada the sum of CDN$146 million (approximately US$105 million), an amount determined by both
parties to be appropriate upon investigation. HP recorded $70 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and had recorded $35 million in the prior fiscal year. HP determined that it
was important for HP to honor its contractual obligations, rather than engage in protracted litigation with the Government of Canada, despite the lack of evidence that HP employees derived any
improper benefit from the complex scheme designed to exploit both parties. HP has initiated proceedings to recover these funds from responsible individuals, and continues to consider further
proceedings against others to recover additional funds.

HP
is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified above, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities, employment, employee
benefits and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," HP makes a provision for a liability when it
is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. HP believes it has adequate provisions for any such matters. HP reviews these provisions at
least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.
Based on its experience, HP believes that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters discussed above are not a meaningful indicator of HP's potential liability. Litigation is inherently
unpredictable. However, HP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Nevertheless, it is possible that cash flows or results of operations could be
materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies.

Environmental

HP is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by United States or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), known as "Superfund," or state laws similar to CERCLA. HP is also conducting environmental investigations or remediations at several current or former
operating sites pursuant to administrative orders or consent agreements with state environmental agencies. It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside and
outside the United States, even if not subject to regulations imposed by local governments. The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when it is considered
probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Historically, environmental costs have not been material to our operations or financial position.

HP
repurchased shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 under an ongoing systematic program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and also to
return cash to stockholders. This program authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. During fiscal year 2004 HP's Board of Directors authorized $5.0 billion for
future repurchases of outstanding common stock, including authorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of HP shares during the fourth quarter that HP announced on September 20, 2004. Shares
repurchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 included open market repurchases of 31 million shares for $555 million, 72 million shares for $1.3 billion under an
accelerated share repurchase program with an investment bank that HP


announced
on September 20, 2004 (the "Accelerated Purchase") and 19 million shares for $350 million from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation (the "Packard Foundation") under
the terms of a memorandum of understanding dated September 9, 2002 and amended and restated September 17, 2004 that, among other things, prices the repurchases by reference to the volume
weighted-average price for composite New York Stock Exchange transactions on trading days in which a repurchase occurs. Both the Accelerated Repurchase and the repurchases from the Packard Foundation
are included in the totals in the table above.

The
Accelerated Purchase occurred on September 20, 2004 and the program was completed in November 2004, which is in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Upon completion of the
program, HP paid a $51 million price adjustment based on the difference between the $18.82 weighted average price of the open market stock purchases by the investment bank and the initial
purchase price of $18.11 per share. The price adjustment also included certain amounts reflecting the investment bank's carrying costs or benefits from purchasing shares at prices other than the
initial price and the investment bank's benefits from receiving the $1.3 billion payment in advance of its purchases.

As
of October 31, 2004, HP had remaining authorization of approximately $2.9 billion for future share repurchases.

revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured.
The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was $272 million, net of related taxes of $108 million.


ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere in this document.

OVERVIEW

We are a leading global technology company and generate net revenue and earn our profits from the sale of products, technologies, solutions and services to
consumers, businesses and governments. Our portfolio is broad and includes personal computers, handheld computing devices, home and business imaging and printing devices, publishing systems, storage
and servers, a wide array of information technology ("IT") services and software solutions. We have seven business segments: the Personal Systems Group ("PSG"), the Imaging and Printing Group ("IPG"),
Enterprise Storage & Servers ("ESS"), HP Services ("HPS"), HP Financial Services ("HPFS"), Software and Corporate Investments. Given the cross-segment linkages in our Adaptive Enterprise
Strategy, and in order to capitalize on up-selling and cross-selling opportunities, ESS, HPS and Software are structured beneath a broader Technology Solutions Group ("TSG"). While TSG is not an
operating segment, we sometimes provide financial data aggregating the segments within TSG in order to provide a supplementary view of our business.

Our
business strategy revolves around the following strategic imperatives:

•

to
provide consumer customers with superior products, services and overall experiences by providing leading-edge technologies that work seamlessly together;

•

to
deliver to business customers the best return on IT investments in the industry;

•

to
build world class cost structures and processes across our entire portfolio of businesses; and

•

to
focus our innovation and research and development in areas where we can make unique contributions while partnering with top providers in other areas to enable us to
provide our customers complete IT solutions.

This
approach requires us to excel both in individual product categories and in managing across our broad portfolio in order to drive growth while optimizing cost structure. At the same
time, our product and geographic breadth help reduce volatility by balancing our financial results across a related but diversified set of businesses.

Our
financial results also are impacted by our ability to predict and to respond to industry-wide trends. For instance, underlying our strategy is our belief that physical, static
processes will continue to shift to processes that are digital, mobile, virtual and personal. By anticipating these shifts and preparing solutions that make these changes simple for customers, we have
the opportunity to accelerate these shifts and capture revenue and market share. Our approach to preparing these solutions can be seen in programs such as our digital photography initiative, where we
offer compatible solutions spanning cameras, printers and paper, as well as in the focus on flexibility, modularity and integration in our Adaptive Enterprise solutions.

Another
trend significant to our business and financial results is the shift toward standardized products, which presents revenue opportunities for certain of our businesses but presents
an ongoing challenge to our margins. To help address the potential margin impact of standardization, we take ongoing actions related to both revenue generation and cost structure management. In the
sales and


marketing
area, we are instituting programs designed to improve the rates at which we sell higher-margin configurations or options. We also continue to focus on managing procurement and labor
expenses. Key to our overall efforts in delivering superior products while maintaining a world-class cost structure is the increasingly global nature of technology expertise. This trend is allowing us
to develop a global delivery structure to take advantage of regions where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs. As part of this effort, we continually evaluate our workforce and
make adjustments we deem appropriate. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce
structure, but we believe that the fundamental shift to global delivery is crucial to maintaining a long-term competitive cost structure.

In
terms of how our execution has translated into financial performance, the following provides our overview of key fiscal 2004 financial metrics:

Cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004 totaled $12.7 billion, a decline of $1.5 billion from
the October 31, 2003 balance of $14.2 billion. The decline was related primarily to increased cash returned to stockholders through share repurchases and increased cash utilized for
acquisitions in fiscal 2004, offset in part by increased earnings.

We
intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements,
the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and
estimates affect our consolidated financial statements.

In
order to provide additional information relating to our operating results, we also present a supplemental section of combined company information that discusses our operating results
for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 as if HP and Compaq had been a combined company for all of fiscal 2002.

The
discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment and supplemental sections of combined
company information that discuss our segment operating results as if HP and Compaq had been a combined company for all of fiscal 2002.

For
a further discussion of factors that could impact operating results, see the section entitled "Factors That Could Affect Future Results" below.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

General

The Consolidated Financial Statements of HP are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit
Committee of HP's Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.

An
accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is
made; if different estimates reasonably could have been used; or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically could materially impact the financial statements.
Management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets

We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The provisions of SFAS No. 142 require that a
two-step impairment test be performed on goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the
reportable segments identified in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market
approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value
based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not
impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform
the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair
value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. SFAS No. 142 also requires that the fair value of the purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and
compared to the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is
less than the carrying value.

Determining
the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market
conditions, and determination of


appropriate
market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from
those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units.

Our
annual goodwill impairment analysis, which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of fair value over carrying
value for each of HP's reporting units as of August 1, 2004, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately $700 million to approximately $34 billion. In order to evaluate the
sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease would
result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $200 million to approximately $30 billion for each of HP's reporting units.

Revenue Recognition

We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and, while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are
agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate
accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price
should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known,
uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customer-negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements. Changes in the allocation
of the sales price between elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.

We
recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixed price contracts, such as consulting arrangements, using the proportional performance method. When applying the proportional
performance method, we rely on estimates of total expected contract costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date. We follow this method because reasonably dependable estimates of
the revenue applicable to various stages of a contract can be made. Total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of the contract. Changes in revenue as a result of revisions to
cost estimates are recorded to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known.

We
record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, promotions, other volume-based incentives and
expected returns. Future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at
the time the incentive is offered. Additionally, certain incentive programs require us to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive.


Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined using a combination of factors to ensure that our trade and financing receivables balances are not overstated
due to uncollectibility. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, trends in overall
weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, significant one-time events, historical experience and the use of third-party credit risk models that
generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors and the financial condition of customers. Also, we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become
aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If
circumstances related to customers change, our estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be further adjusted, either upward or downward. The annual provision for doubtful accounts has
ranged from 0.1% to 0.5% of net revenue over the last three fiscal years. Using our third-party credit risk model at October 31, 2004, a 50 basis point deterioration in either the weighted
average default probabilities of our significant customers or in the overall mix of our portfolio would have resulted in an approximately $20 million increase to our trade allowance at the end
of fiscal year 2004.

Inventory

Our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, are made at the
product group level for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, rapid technological changes, product life cycle and
development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues. Revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates.

Restructuring

We have engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates related to realizable values of
assets made redundant or obsolete and expenses for severance and other employee separation costs, lease cancellation and other exit costs. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the
amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted.

Warranty Provision

We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis. Our
standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. While we engage in
extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, our estimated warranty obligation is based upon warranty terms,
ongoing product failure rates, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call and current period product shipments. If actual product failure rates, repair rates, service delivery costs or
post-sales support costs differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required. Warranty terms generally range from one to three years depending upon
the product. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty provision has averaged approximately 4% of net product revenues, while actual annual warranty costs also have averaged approximately
4% of net product revenues.


Retirement Benefits

Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts.
These assumptions relate to discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets, medical cost trend rates and other factors. We base the discount rate assumption on current
investment yields on high quality fixed income investments. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual experience and future and near-term outlook.
Long-term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management's expectation of the future economic environment, as well as target asset allocations.
Our medical cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely
long-term trends. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants.

Our
major assumptions for determining net benefit cost for pension and post-retirement plans include the long-term return on plan assets, the discount rate for
determining plan obligations and the future expected average increase in compensation levels. These rates vary by plan and the weighted average rates used are set forth in Note 15 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics, and, in general, changes, if any, have moved in the same direction over the last several years. For fiscal
2004, a change in the weighted average rates would have had the following impact on our net benefit cost:

•

a
decrease of 25 basis points in the long-term rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $20 million;

•

a
decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $50 million; and

•

a
decrease of 25 basis points in the future compensation rate would have decreased our net benefit cost by approximately $40 million.

Taxes on Earnings

Our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned
to be reinvested indefinitely outside the United States. As described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our fiscal year 2004 results do not reflect the impact of the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Act"). We have not completed the process of reevaluating our position with respect to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings to take into account the
possible election of the repatriation provisions contained in the Jobs Act. Foreign earnings remittance amounts are planned based on projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and
long-term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the United States
and provide the U.S. federal taxes due on these amounts. Further, as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments undertaken by HP, income from manufacturing activities in certain
countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes, for years through 2018. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and long-term
investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate.

We
record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We have considered future market growth, forecasted earnings,
future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and prudent and feasible


tax
planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the
future, an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that it is more likely than not that
the net deferred tax assets would be realized, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be
able to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

We
calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the
subsequent year. Adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified, which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for U.S. federal and state provisions.

The
amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities, which often result in proposed assessments. Our estimate for the potential
outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental. We believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. However, our future results may
include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire.
Additionally, the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates. As a result, our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly
basis.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting
for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123") and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees,
including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values, beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005, with
early adoption encouraged. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123, no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. We are required to adopt
SFAS 123R in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, beginning August 1, 2005. Under SFAS 123R, we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based
payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options. Under the
retroactive
options, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all periods presented. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all
unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of SFAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested
stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. We are evaluating the requirements of SFAS 123R and we expect that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a
material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share. We have not yet determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R, and we have not
determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS 123.

See
Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a description of other recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and
estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition.

In
fiscal 2004, net revenue increased 9% from the prior year period (3% on a constant currency basis). The favorable currency impact was due primarily to the weakening of the dollar
against the euro. U.S. net revenue remained flat at $29.4 billion, while international net revenue increased 15% to $50.5 billion. PSG experienced net revenue growth across all
businesses, with customer demand resulting in significant volume increases in desktop and notebook PCs. The overall volume increase was offset by a slight decline in the overall average selling prices
("ASPs") due to a mix shift to lower-end products as well as component cost declines. IPG net revenue growth in fiscal year 2004 was driven by the continued volume growth of printer
supplies. LaserJet supplies and color laser printers experienced strong volume growth due to the growing demand for color-related products and digital photography. HPS achieved net revenue growth
across all businesses in fiscal 2004. The impact of major outsourcing deals and, to a lesser extent, the Triaton acquisition in the second half of the year, contributed to the growth in managed
services and technology services (formerly called customer support). In fiscal 2004, ESS net revenue growth was generated by sales of industry standard servers, primarily our ProLiant server line.
Revenue declines from competitive pressures in storage and business critical servers moderated the overall segment net revenue growth. The slight decrease in HPFS net revenue for fiscal 2004 was due
primarily to lower levels of revenue-generating assets.

In
fiscal 2003, net revenue increased 29% from the prior year period (23% or a constant currency basis) as a result primarily of our acquisition of Compaq at the beginning of
May 2002. The favorable currency impact was due primarily to the weakening of the dollar against the euro. U.S. net revenue increased 25% to $29.2 billion, while international net
revenue grew 32% to $43.8 billion. The net revenue increase in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 attributable to our acquisition of Compaq resulted in market share increases in PSG, ESS
and HPS and, to a lesser extent, HPFS. IPG also contributed to the overall net revenue increase in fiscal 2003 due primarily to strong growth in our printer supplies reflecting higher volumes as a
result of continued expansion of the printer hardware installed base and, to a lesser extent, growth in printer hardware and digital imaging products as well as synergies resulting from the Compaq
acquisition. Declining ASPs due to competitive pricing pressures and a shift in sales mix to lower-priced products and service offerings moderated our overall net revenue increases in fiscal 2003.

Competitive pricing pressures contributed significantly to the gross margin decline in ESS, HPS and PSG for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. In ESS the
competitive environment contributed to the gross margin decline in the standards based server group along with the storage group. In addition to competitive pricing pressures, the gross margin decline
in HPS reflected mix shifts to lower margin contracts for technology services and large outsourcing contracts for managed services, which typically have lower margins in the early stages of their life
cycles. Competitive pricing pressures, particularly in Europe, contributed to the gross margin decline in PSG. IPG gross margin remained flat for fiscal 2004, with the favorable impact from cost
reductions and increased shipments in supplies being offset by a mix shift to lower margin products. HPFS gross margin increased for fiscal 2004 due to higher portfolio profitability primarily from
end-of-lease transactions. In fiscal 2004, gross margin also was favorably impacted by the currency effects on net revenue resulting primarily from the weakening of the dollar against the euro.

The
gross margin improvement for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due to cost reductions resulting from workforce reductions and initial economies of scale and procurement
leverage resulting from the Compaq acquisition. Declining ASPs due to competitive pricing pressures and a mix shift toward lower-margin products across most of our segments moderated the overall
increase. In addition, fiscal 2003 gross margin was impacted favorably by currency effects on net revenue resulting primarily from the weakening of the dollar against the euro, as well as higher cost
of sales in fiscal 2002 due to $147 million of inventory adjustments resulting from product roadmap decisions. ESS showed a slight improvement compared to the prior year period as a result of
growth in storage, which offset the unfavorable impact of a mix shift toward industry standard servers. HPS did not have a significant impact on the change in gross margin. PSG had a negative impact
on gross margin due to an unfavorable mix shift with increased sales in lower-margin products as a percentage of the overall business.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

In
comparison to prior years, research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased in fiscal 2004 and 2003. For fiscal 2004, total research and development spending
decreased as a percentage of net revenue in each of our major segments. The decrease was a result of our focus on investing in categories of the business that yield stronger long-term returns in the
marketplace and on curtailing spending in the more mature categories of our business, particularly within ESS. In addition, we continued to realize synergies from the Compaq acquisition during fiscal
2004, and we have shifted our business towards more standards-based products, leveraging research and development from our technology partners. These decreases as a percentage of net revenue were
moderated by increased research and development spending in IPG related to strategic initiatives and unfavorable currency impacts resulting primarily from the weakening of the dollar against the euro.
IPG's increase in research and development spending was due primarily to our investment in inkjet technology. For fiscal 2003, the decrease was due primarily to a full year of increased net revenue
from our acquisition of Compaq, combined with the favorable impact of prior year restructuring actions, as well as expense control measures. In addition, the overall decrease in fiscal 2003 expense
was moderated by higher pension and other post-retirement costs and unfavorable currency effects of the weakening of the dollar against the euro.


Selling, General and Administrative

The
decline in selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to the increase in net revenue
outpacing expense growth. This was in part a result of effective expense controls and workforce reduction measures. Unfavorable currency impacts moderated the decline due to the weakening of the
dollar against the euro. In fiscal 2003, as compared to fiscal 2002, selling general and administrative expense as a percentage of net revenue declined slightly. The majority of the change was
attributable to our acquisition of Compaq in May 2002, including our workforce reduction efforts, expense control measures as well as lower bad debt expense. In addition, fiscal 2003 expense
was impacted partially by unfavorable currency effects primarily from the weakening of the dollar against the euro.

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets

The
increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was due primarily to the amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Triaton GmbH,
Triaton France SAS and Triaton N.A., Inc. (USA) (collectively "Triaton") in April 2004. The increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to
amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the acquisition of Compaq in May 2002, and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Indigo N.V. ("Indigo") in March 2002. This
increase was offset in part by the elimination of goodwill amortization, as well as the write-off of purchased intangible assets related to our middleware and storage virtualization
offerings in fiscal 2002 that related to the Compaq acquisition product road map.

Restructuring Charges

HP
implemented certain strategic restructuring programs during fiscal years 2003 and 2002. Net restructuring charges for the 3-year period ended October 31, 2004
aggregated approximately $2.7 billion, the majority of which related to restructuring of pre-merger HP in connection with the 2002 acquisition of Compaq. In fiscal 2003, HP
implemented restructuring programs in order to manage our cost structure and better align it with business conditions. The majority of restructuring charges incurred during fiscal 2004 represent
fiscal 2003 restructuring plan activities that did not meet the recognition criteria for accrual during 2003 and, accordingly, were charged to expense as incurred in fiscal 2004, as well as changes in
the original estimates for the fiscal 2002 and 2003 plans. These changes in estimates were related primarily to asset impairments for buildings vacated as a result of the Compaq acquisition,
adjustments to estimates of severance and other employee benefits costs as well as revisions to contract termination costs.

In
addition, HP recorded approximately $1.2 billion of restructuring liability as part of the acquisition of Compaq and allocated such liability as an element of the original
purchase price allocation in fiscal 2002. Approximately $960 million of this amount related to the restructuring of the pre-merger Compaq business at the time of the acquisition,
and approximately $259 million related to pre-existing Compaq restructuring liabilities. Downward revisions to the original estimates for these pre-merger Compaq-related
restructuring plans have been recorded as decreases to the Compaq-related goodwill, while increases have been recorded as restructuring expense in the period in which they occur.

The
effect of the restructuring programs put in place as a result of the acquisition of Compaq has been to reduce costs by removing duplication, leverage the benefits of the larger
organization, as well


as
streamline and focus the operations of HP. Cost benefits earned from strategic product roadmap decisions, headcount and facilities reductions and realignment, and more focused and efficient
research and development and sales and marketing programs, have been substantial, as seen in the progressive lowering of operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Of the total
$3.5 billion of cost synergies associated with the Compaq integration completed at the end of fiscal 2003, approximately $2 billion are the result of these acquisition-related
restructuring plans. These efforts not only have improved profitability but also have allowed HP to target and serve its customers better.

Restructuring
liabilities of $288 million at October 31, 2004 are composed primarily of the remaining cash payments on certain severance benefits for non-U.S.
operations and contract termination costs, including canceled facility leases. These obligations will be largely settled by the end of fiscal 2010. In addition, approximately $6 million of
costs related to the 2003 plans have not yet been accrued, as the requirements for recognition have not yet been met, and will be charged to operations as the restructuring activities occur during
fiscal 2005.

The
following table summarizes the major activities in aggregate and during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 related to restructuring programs:

Workforce Rebalancing

We
continue to focus on managing procurement expenses and developing a global delivery structure to take advantage of regions where advanced technical expertise is available at lower
costs. As part of this effort, we continually evaluate our workforce and make adjustments we deem appropriate. When we make adjustments to our workforce, we may incur expenses associated with
workforce reductions that delay the financial benefit of a more efficient workforce structure, but we believe that the fundamental shift to global delivery is crucial to maintaining a long-term
competitive cost structure. In this context, we expect to incur expenses of approximately $200 million in the first half of fiscal 2005 in connection with workforce reductions. Full financial
benefits from workforce reductions begin when aggregate cost savings exceed the separation expenses, which is typically in the quarterly period following the quarter in which these expenses are
incurred.

Acquisition-Related Charges

Acquisition-related
charges in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 consist substantially of costs related to the Compaq acquisition. Acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2004 consisted primarily
of the amortization of deferred compensation, merger-related inventory adjustments and professional fees, while the costs in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 were attributable primarily to costs incurred
for employee retention bonuses, professional fees and consulting services. Acquisition-related charges in fiscal year 2002 also included costs incurred for proxy solicitation and advertising for the
Compaq acquisition.

In-Process Research and Development Charges

In-process
research & development ("IPR&D") charges are recorded in connection with acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, as more fully described in
Note 5 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. Research and development projects engaged in by an acquired company are analyzed as of the acquisition date to determine their current technological feasibility and
possible future alternative uses. Based on an analysis of estimated costs to develop, discounted cash flows from the projects, revenue estimates related to market size, growth factors, technology
trends and in the absence of alternative future use, HP determines the purchase price amount to be allocated to IPR&D and records the amount as expense at that time. In fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 we
recorded IPR&D charges of $37 million, $1 million and $793 million, respectively, related to acquisitions during those years.

Interest and Other, Net

Interest and other, net increased $14 million in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003. The increase in fiscal 2004 was the result of lower interest expense offset
partially by higher currency losses from balance sheet remeasurement and related hedging strategies. Interest and other, net decreased $31 million in fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002. The decline
in fiscal 2003 was attributable primarily to increased interest expense associated with higher average borrowings and lower dividend and other income associated with our investment activities as
compared to fiscal 2002, while lower net currency losses from our balance sheet remeasurement moderated the decline.

Gains (Losses) on Investments and Early Extinguishment of Debt

The net gain for fiscal 2004 was attributable mainly to the realization of a contingent gain associated with a prior period divestiture and realized gains from
the sale of investments in excess of


impairment
charges. Net losses in fiscal 2003 and 2002 resulted mainly from impairment charges in excess of gains realized on our investment portfolio. Losses decreased in fiscal 2003 from 2002 while
gains from the early extinguishment of debt under our repurchase program for zero coupon subordinated convertible notes offset slightly the fiscal 2002 impairment losses.

Our
investment portfolio includes equity investments in publicly-traded and privately-held emerging technology companies. Many of these emerging technology companies are
still in the start-up or development stage. Our investments in these companies are inherently risky because the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the
early stages and may never become successful. Depending on market conditions, we may incur additional charges on our investment portfolio in the future.

Dispute Settlement

On May 14, 2004, HP announced that it had resolved a dispute regarding certain contracts with the Government of Canada. HP Canada agreed to reimburse the
Government of Canada the sum of CDN$146 million (approximately US$105 million on such date). This settlement resulted in an additional charge of $70 million in the second quarter
of fiscal 2004, as more fully described in Note 17 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

In
July 2001, we signed a definitive agreement with Comdisco, Inc. ("Comdisco") to acquire substantially all of Comdisco's business continuity services business. The
agreement was subject to the bankruptcy court sales process and related approvals. In November 2001, the bankruptcy court announced that we were not selected as the winning bid to acquire
Comdisco's business continuity services business. In the third quarter of fiscal 2002, we received $14 million in a settlement related to the termination of the definitive agreement.

Provision for (Benefit from) Taxes

Our effective tax rate on earnings from operations in fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% due generally to tax rate
benefits of certain earnings from operations in lower-tax jurisdictions throughout the world for which no U.S. taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested
indefinitely outside the United States. For a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate, see Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8.

Our
effective tax rate resulted in a 16.7% provision in fiscal 2004 on our pretax earnings, a 12.1% provision in fiscal 2003 on our pre-tax earnings and an 11.6% benefit in fiscal 2002
on our pre-tax loss. In fiscal 2004, the tax rate benefited from net favorable adjustments to previously estimated tax liabilities of $207 million, which decreased the provision for taxes by
approximately $0.07 per share. Excluding these adjustments, our tax rate for fiscal 2004 would have been 21.6%. The most significant favorable adjustments related to the resolution of a California
state income tax audit, a net favorable revision to estimated tax accruals upon filing the 2003 U.S. income tax return, and a reduction in taxes on foreign earnings due to a change in regulatory
policy. These favorable adjustments were offset in part by the net effect of smaller adjustments to income tax liabilities in various jurisdictions.

The
increase in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003, and fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002, is driven primarily by a decline in the benefit percentage from lower rates in
other jurisdictions in both periods. Lower tax rates in non-U.S. jurisdictions provided a benefit of 15.3% in fiscal 2004, a decline from a benefit of 23.9% and 36.0% in fiscal 2003 and
fiscal 2002, respectively. The major factor causing


the
reduction in this rate benefit percentage in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003 from the respective preceding years is the decline in restructuring and other deductible acquisition-related charges that
were incurred for the most part in higher-tax jurisdictions during those years. In fiscal 2002, operating losses also were a significant contributor to the tax benefit, offset in part by
the impact of non-deductible items, primarily acquisition-related charges, goodwill amortization and IPR&D charges.

Combined Company Results

The following discussion includes the combined results of operations of HP and Compaq as if the acquisition had occurred as of the beginning of fiscal 2002. We
have included this additional information in order to provide further insight into our prior period operating results and trends. This supplemental information is presented in a manner consistent with
the disclosure requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 141, "Business Combinations." The combined company results for fiscal 2003 are the same as the historical
results, as Compaq was included for the entire period. Due to different historical fiscal period ends for HP and Compaq, the results for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 combine the
results of HP for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 and the historical quarterly results of Compaq for the six-month period ended March 31, 2002 and for the period
May 3, 2002 (the acquisition date) to October 31, 2002.

Results
of operations for the combined company, in dollars and as a percentage of net revenue, were as follows:

On
a combined company basis, net revenue increased 1% (but declined 4% on a constant currency basis) in fiscal 2003. U.S. net revenue remained essentially flat at $29.2 billion,
while international net revenue increased 1% to $43.8 billion. Overall, the combined company net revenue in fiscal 2003 was impacted favorably by currency effects, particularly the weakening of
the dollar against the euro. Lower average selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures, a shift in sales mix to lower-priced products and service offerings and the consolidation of product
offerings as a result of post-acquisition product roadmap decisions moderated the overall increase. The net revenue increase in IPG was driven by strong growth in printer supplies
resulting from a rise in volumes, reflecting continued expansion of the printer hardware installed base, and to a lesser extent, growth from our business printer hardware and digital imaging products.
The ESS net revenue decline
was attributable primarily to a net revenue decrease in business critical servers due to competitive pricing as well as cautious enterprise capital spending. The net revenue decline in PSG resulted
primarily from lower average selling prices due to competitive pricing pressure and, to a lesser extent, a decline in volumes in commercial and consumer desktop PCs. The HPFS net revenue decline was
due primarily to a decrease in revenue-generating assets. HPS net revenue decreased slightly due primarily to declines in the consulting and integration business, moderated by increases in managed
services and technology services net revenue.

Gross margin as a percentage of combined company net revenue improved 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. Overall, gross
margin improvement in fiscal 2003 was attributable primarily to cost savings resulting from improved cost structures, continued expense control measures and, to a lesser extent, decreased component
prices, moderated by declining average selling prices due to competitive pricing pressures. The gross margin improvement in PSG was due primarily to reduced direct and indirect procurement costs,
reflecting synergies associated with our acquisition of Compaq. The improvement in HPFS gross margin was due primarily to reduced bad debt expense resulting from a stronger portfolio. IPG gross margin
improvement was due primarily to the higher-margin supplies business becoming a greater percentage of IPG net revenue combined with favorable currency impact on net revenue resulting primarily from
the weakening of the dollar against the euro. ESS's gross margin improvement primarily reflected cost reductions in the storage and industry standard server businesses as a result of the Compaq
acquisition, offset in part by the product mix shift away from higher-margin business critical servers toward lower-margin industry standard servers. The HPS gross margin decline was attributable
primarily to competitive pricing pressures and reduced service levels in the technology services business. In addition, the overall gross margin was impacted favorably by a 0.2 percentage point
improvement attributable primarily to inventory adjustments of $147 million in fiscal 2002 resulting from product roadmap decisions.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

Research
and development expense decreased 8% in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. The decrease was attributable primarily to our workforce reduction efforts and expense control
measures. In fiscal 2003, research and development expense decreased in each of our business segments, except for IPG, in which research and development expense increased by 8%. IPG's increase in
research and development spending resulted primarily from our continued investment in emerging inkjet technology. In addition, the overall decrease in fiscal 2003 expense was moderated by higher
pension and other post-retirement costs and unfavorable currency effects of the weakening of the dollar against the euro.

Selling, General and Administrative

Selling,
general and administrative expense remained flat in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, unfavorable currency effects driven mainly by the weakening of the
dollar against the euro, higher sales and marketing costs associated with the company-wide product branding campaign and higher pension and other post-retirement costs offset
almost entirely the overall decreases attributable to workforce reduction efforts, expense control measures and lower bad debt expense.

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets

Effective
in fiscal 2003 (the date of adoption of SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets"), we no longer amortize goodwill and instead test goodwill at least annually
for impairment. On a combined company basis, amortization expense decreased by $101 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. The decrease in fiscal 2003 expense was due primarily to
the elimination of goodwill amortization and the write-off of the purchased intangible assets related to our middleware and storage virtualization offerings in fiscal 2002 as a result of
product roadmap decisions in connection with the Compaq acquisition.


Restructuring Charges

On
a combined company basis, we recorded restructuring charges of $800 million in fiscal 2003 and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2002. A discussion of the fiscal 2003 and 2002
charges recorded by HP is included in the previous presentation.

Acquisition-Related Charges

In
connection with the Compaq acquisition, the combined company incurred acquisition-related charges of $280 million in fiscal 2003 and $772 million in fiscal 2002, which
charges consisted primarily of costs incurred for employee retention bonuses, consulting services and other professional fees. In addition, the acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2002 included
costs incurred for proxy solicitation and advertising.

In-Process Research and Development Charges

IPR&D
charges are the same on a combined company basis as previously discussed.

Interest and Other, Net

On a combined company basis, interest and other, net remained essentially flat in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, lower net losses on foreign currency transactions
resulting from our balance sheet remeasurement and related hedging strategies as compared to fiscal 2002 were offset almost entirely by lower interest income and higher interest expense on debt.

Losses on Investments and Early Extinguishment of Debt

On a combined company basis, net losses were $29 million in fiscal 2003 and $70 million in fiscal 2002 due generally to the reasons discussed
previously.

Dispute Settlement

In fiscal 2002 we recorded settlement income of $14 million, as more fully discussed previously.

Provision for (Benefit from) Taxes

On a combined company basis, our effective tax rate resulted in a 12.1% provision in fiscal 2003 on our pretax earnings and a 12.0% benefit in fiscal 2002 on our
pretax loss. Our effective tax rate differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% in fiscal 2003 and 2002 due generally to the reasons discussed previously.

Segment Information

A description of the products and services, as well as year-to-date financial data, for each segment can be found in Note 18 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We have restated segment financial data for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2003 and 2002 to reflect changes in HP's organizational
structure that occurred at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2004. We describe these changes more fully in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We have
presented the business segments in this Form 10-K based on our management organizational structure as of October 31, 2004, and the distinct nature of various businesses.
Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed. The discussions


below
include the results of each of our segments. Supplemental sections of combined company information that discuss our segment operating results as if HP and Compaq had been combined for all of
fiscal 2002 are presented in a manner consistent with the supplemental combined-company disclosures included in the consolidated operating results discussion.

Technology Solutions Group

Given the cross-segment linkages in our Adaptive Enterprise offering, and in order to capitalize on up-selling and cross-selling opportunities, ESS, HPS and
Software are structured beneath a broader Technology Solutions Group ("TSG"). While TSG is not an operating segment, we sometimes provide financial data aggregating the segments within TSG in order to
provide a supplementary view of our business. Each of the reportable segments of TSG is described in more detail below.

ESS
net revenue increased 4% in fiscal year 2004 from fiscal 2003. Revenue on a constant currency basis decreased 2%. The favorable currency impact was due primarily to the weakening of
the dollar against the euro. In fiscal 2004, ESS performance was hurt in the third fiscal quarter by execution issues, namely a systems migration in the U.S., channel management issues in EMEA and
weakness in Storage. ESS net revenue growth was, however, helped by industry standard servers' unit growth of 22%, which translated to a 12% net revenue increase from fiscal 2003 in that category. Net
revenue in business critical servers declined by 2% in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, reflecting the ongoing decline of the AlphaServer product line. RISC and Itanium-based servers
experienced revenue growth. We introduced mid-range and high-end Itanium products widely in fiscal year 2004, and sales continued to increase during the year, with Itanium
servers representing 16% of business critical servers in the fourth fiscal quarter. HP-UX server revenue increased 2% from fiscal 2003, offset by declines in Alpha as we transition customers to
non-Alpha products. NonStop server net revenue declined 1% from the prior year, reflecting a maturing installed base. Storage net revenue declined 7%, with declines in both the overall array and tape
businesses. Net revenue declines from fiscal 2003 were due primarily to our exposure to the declining tape market, aggressive pricing, inadequate storage sales specialists coverage and some product
updates that occurred late in fiscal 2004. Growth in storage


software
and network attached storage offset partially the revenue decline in the primary product groups.

ESS
earnings from operations in fiscal 2004 improved by 0.1 percentage points, reflecting a 3.9 percentage point decrease in operating expenses in relation to revenue
resulting from effective cost management and increased volume in the industry standard server business. A decline in gross margin of 3.8 percentage points offset the decline in operating
expenses and volume growth. The gross margin decline was the result of competitive pressures impacting both the industry standard servers group and the storage business, along with a mix shift to
lower margin products within the business critical servers group and more generally the continued mix shift towards industry standard servers within the segment. The business continues to focus on
increasing direct sales, improving option attach rates and reducing warranty costs in order to optimize future gross margins. Additionally, the execution issues of the third quarter that led to an
operating loss in the quarter hampered full year performance.

The
increase in ESS year-over-year operating results in fiscal 2003 was due substantially to the acquisition of Compaq. The significant increases from Compaq's
industry standard server business and Compaq's storage and business critical server businesses were the main contributors to the overall net revenue growth in fiscal 2003. Although overall unit sales
increased due to the acquisition of Compaq, continued competitive pricing pressures impacted ASPs unfavorably in fiscal 2003. Discontinuance of HP's NetServer and certain storage products as part of
the post-acquisition product roadmap decisions moderated volume growth. The improvement in the operating margin ratio was attributable primarily to workforce reduction activities and
effective cost management, offset in part by a decline in gross margin. The gross margin deterioration reflected competitive pricing pressures and a mix shift toward industry standard servers, which
have significantly lower margins than other products in the segment.

ESS's
combined company net revenue declined 5% in fiscal 2003. The net revenue decrease in fiscal 2003 was 10% on a constant currency basis. The favorable currency impact was due
primarily to the weakening of the dollar against the euro. Overall, segment net revenue in fiscal 2003 continued to be impacted unfavorably by competitive pricing pressures, product roadmap
transitions and cautious enterprise IT spending across all business units and most geographic regions.

The
combined company net revenue decline for many business critical server products in fiscal 2003 reflected competitive pricing as well as constraints on enterprise capital spending for
large purchases. Low-end and mid-range UNIX net revenue declined during the period, offset in part by strong growth in high-end UNIX servers due to continued
strength in Superdome products. NonStop server net revenue declined in fiscal 2003, reflecting weak spending in the telecommunications and financial services industries. Product roadmap transitions in
tape libraries due to our exiting the OEM business and decreased sales of legacy arrays, offset in part by a mix shift toward EVA products, drove the storage net revenue decline in fiscal 2003. Unit
sales of industry standard servers increased in fiscal 2003 and more than offset the net revenue decline attributable to lower ASPs and a mix shift toward low-end servers. Despite unit
declines in our NetServer products due to the post-acquisition roadmap decision to discontinue this line of servers, total industry standard server units grew approximately 9% in the
period due to strong worldwide shipments of our ProLiant servers.

Combined
company earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue were 1.0% in fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2003, the operating loss improvement of 3.0 percentage points was due
to a 1.7 percentage point decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue and a 1.3 percentage point increase in gross margin. Cost savings achieved through workforce
reductions and continued cost control measures, offset in part by an unfavorable currency impact, drove the decline in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2003. The gross margin
improvement in the period reflected primarily cost reductions resulting from the Compaq acquisition in the storage and industry standard server businesses, coupled with a product mix shift within
business critical servers and storage. An unfavorable mix shift from low- and mid-range business critical servers toward lower-margin industry standard servers moderated the
gross margin improvements during the period.

HPS'
net revenue increased 12% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. On a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 5% in fiscal 2004. The favorable currency impact was due
primarily to the weakening of the dollar against the euro and the yen. In fiscal 2004, the growth in managed services was due to increased net revenue from new large outsourcing deals and the
expansion of services to existing customers, as well as the Triaton acquisition. The growth in technology services net revenue was driven primarily by favorable currency impacts and the Triaton
acquisition, along with strength in integrated support, desktop lifecycle and mission critical support solutions. An increase in core consulting and integration services contributed to a slight growth
in the consulting and integration business in fiscal 2004, while a decrease in sales of complimentary third-party products impacted net revenue for this business negatively.

HPS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue declined 1.8 percentage points in fiscal 2004 in part due to the continued growth in managed services, a lower-margin
business, becoming an increasingly larger part of HPS. Operating profit ratio declines in the managed services and technology services business contributed to the overall segment operating profit
ratio decline in fiscal 2004. Large outsourcing contracts at the early stages of their life cycle had lower margins in fiscal 2004, which drove the decline in the managed services operating profit
ratio. In the technology services business, competitive pricing pressures in both renewals and new contracts and a mix shift from higher margin support agreements (e.g., Unix) to lower margin
contracts (e.g., networking installations and integrated multi-vendor support offerings) affected the technology services operating profit ratio and to a lesser degree costs related to the integration
of recent acquisitions. The overall operating profit ratio decline was moderated somewhat by an operating profit ratio improvement in the consulting and integration business as a result of a sales
force focus on HP's Adaptive Enterprise offerings, customer relationship management and continued process improvements.

The
increase in HPS year-over-year operating results in fiscal 2003 was due substantially to the acquisition of Compaq. Although the acquisition of Compaq
resulted in an increase in services across all business units in fiscal 2003, our consulting and integration and technology services businesses were impacted unfavorably by the weak demand for IT
infrastructure products, the slowdown of enterprise spending, and competitive pricing pressures. Our managed services business benefited from the slowdown in fiscal 2003 as customers reduced costs by
outsourcing IT infrastructure. Earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 due to expense control measures and workforce reduction
initiatives. A shift in the net revenue mix away from the consulting and integration business, which typically has operating profit ratios lower than the segment average, also increased the earnings
from operations ratio.

A
decline in core consulting and integration services drove the combined company net revenue decrease in the consulting and integration business in fiscal 2003. The decline in core
consulting and integration net revenue reflected competitive pricing pressures and weak demand. An increase in new and existing large outsourcing deals, reflecting the ongoing mix shift toward larger
comprehensive deals as customers outsourced substantial portions of their IT infrastructure to HP, as well as favorable currency impacts mentioned above, contributed to the growth in managed services
net revenue in fiscal 2003. The growth in technology services net revenue in fiscal 2003 was due primarily to favorable currency impacts.

Combined
company earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue was 11.0% in fiscal 2003 compared to 11.1% in fiscal 2002. Although the operating profit ratio remained flat in
fiscal 2003, operating expenses decreased as a percentage of net revenue through expense control measures and workforce reductions initiated in fiscal 2002, as well as reduced costs reflecting
synergies associated with our acquisition of Compaq. A favorable business mix shift away from the consulting and integration business, which typically has an operating profit ratio lower than the
segment average, further helped the overall segment operating profit ratio in the period. An operating profit ratio decline in the technology services business reduced fiscal 2003 operating margin.
Competitive pricing pressures and reduced service levels had a negative impact on technology services operating margins. Higher pension and post-retirement costs resulting from fiscal 2003
changes in underlying assumptions, including a decrease in expected portfolio performance, a decrease in discount rates and an increase in medical cost trend rates, as well as the extension of
participation in pension and post-retirement benefit


plans
to eligible pre-acquisition Compaq employees in the United States not covered by such plans prior to January 1, 2003 also contributed to the overall segment operating profit
ratio decline in fiscal 2003.

In
fiscal 2004, Software net revenue increased 19% (16% without acquisitions) from fiscal 2003 and 13% on a constant currency basis. The majority of the currency impact resulted from the
weakening of the dollar against the euro. Of the overall 19% net revenue increase, OpenView, our management solutions software product line, represented 13% (10% without acquisitions) percentage
points of growth on a weighted average net revenue basis, while OpenCall, our telecommunications solutions product line, contributed the remaining 6 percentage points of the net revenue
increase. OpenView net revenue growth was the result of market share gains in a growing market along with the impact of recent acquisitions, which add breadth to our Adaptive Enterprise portfolio. The
growth in OpenCall was due to increased spending in the telecommunications industry, associated with the adoption of the next generation of network infrastructure.

The
operating margin improvement of 8.8 percentage points in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003 was driven primarily by a decrease of operating expense as a percentage of net revenue.
The decrease in operating expense was attributable to effective cost management as operating expenses, particularly marketing and research and development costs, grew slower than net revenue despite
the unfavorable impact of currency and increased acquisition-related costs. There was some gross margin decline, resulting from an increasingly competitive pricing environment.

In
fiscal year 2003, software net revenue increased by 10% when compared to fiscal 2002, due primarily to the acquisition of Compaq. Of the overall 10% revenue increase, on a weighted
average basis OpenView represented 6 percentage points of the increase, while OpenCall contributed the remaining 4 percentage points of the revenue increase. The addition of Compaq
products (primarily in OpenCall) more than offset the decline in sales of similar HP products, which resulted from continued weakness in the telecommunications industry across all geographical
regions. OpenView net revenue growth was the result of market share gains in a growing market.

In
fiscal 2003, the improvement in the operating margin ratio of 25.0 percentage points from fiscal 2002 was attributable primarily to workforce reductions and effective cost
management, offset in part by the unfavorable impact of currency. The gross margin improvement reflected a product mix shift towards higher margin OpenView products.

fiscal 2003 software operating margin improvement of 18.2 percentage points compared to fiscal 2002 was due to a 9.5 percentage point decrease in operating expense as a
percentage of net revenue, along with an 8.7 percentage points increase in gross margin. Cost savings achieved through workforce reductions and continued cost control measures, offset in part
by the unfavorable impact of currency, drove the decline in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2003. The gross margin improvement reflected a product mix shift towards
higher-margin OpenView products.

PSG's net revenue increased 16% in fiscal 2004 from fiscal 2003. On a constant currency basis, the increase was 10%. The favorable currency impact was due
primarily to the weakening of the dollar against the euro. In fiscal 2004, the net revenue increase across all businesses was the result primarily of an overall 17% volume increase. Volume increases
were the result of strong market growth in both consumer and commercial segments, our re-entry into the China market, and the introduction of new products such as the media center PCs,
widescreen notebook PCs, converged devices and a broader product line offering in pen-based iPaqs. In fiscal 2004, consumer and commercial desktop PC volumes increased 15% and 11%,
respectively, while notebook PC volume increased 21%. The volume increase was moderated by a slight decline in ASPs. The ASP decline was due to a mix shift toward lower-end personal
workstations and iPaq handhelds, as well as component cost declines, and was offset partially by a strong monitor attach rate in business PCs. Year-over-year net revenue
increases in consumer and commercial desktop PCs were 15% and 12%, respectively, while notebook PC net revenue increased 22%.

PSG's
earnings from operations as a percent of net revenue was 0.9% in fiscal 2004 compared to 0.1% in fiscal 2003. The increase is the result of volume increases and a decline in
operating expenses of 1.3 percentage points, offset by a decline in gross margin of 0.4 percentage points. The operating expense decline is due to headcount reductions, tightening of
administrative costs, lower research and development spending, and scale efficiencies in selling and marketing costs. The gross margin decline is due primarily to continued competitive pressures in
Europe, expansion into developing markets and a shift towards lower-end products.

The
increase in PSG's year-over-year operating results in fiscal 2003 was due substantially to the acquisition of Compaq in fiscal 2002. Although the acquisition
of Compaq resulted in an increase in unit sales, the continued competitive pricing environment impacted ASPs unfavorably in fiscal 2003. The execution of post-acquisition product roadmap
decisions, which included the discontinuance of the HP Vectra and Jornada product lines, impacted commercial desktop PC and handheld volumes unfavorably in fiscal 2003. Earnings from operations as a
percentage of net revenue increased during fiscal 2003 due to a decrease in operating expenses, primarily from headcount reductions and tightening of administrative costs, as well as lower research
and development spending and an improvement in gross margin. The gross margin improvement was the result primarily of our reduced direct and indirect procurement costs reflecting synergies associated
with our acquisition of Compaq, as well as a shift toward our lower-cost direct business.

The
combined company net revenue decline in fiscal 2003 resulted from a decline in average selling prices across all businesses within PSG and, to a lesser extent, a decline in volumes
in commercial and consumer desktop PCs. The decline in average selling prices during the period was attributable to the realignment of product prices. The continued mix shift from desktops to
notebooks impacted unfavorably consumer and commercial desktop PC volumes. Additionally, the commercial desktop PC volume decline in the period was due to the execution of post-acquisition
product roadmap decisions, which included the discontinuance of the HP Vectra product line. Notebook PC volumes increased in fiscal 2003 compared to the prior year, due to increased product
competitiveness, a broader product portfolio, and the previously mentioned mix shift from desktops to notebooks, offset in part the desktop PC decreases. In addition to the increase in notebook PC
volumes, handheld volumes increased due to new product introductions.

The
combined company earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue was 0.1% in fiscal 2003 compared to a loss of 1.7% in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, an improvement in gross
margin as a percentage of net revenue represented 1.1 percentage points of the 1.8 percentage point increase, while the remaining 0.7 percentage point increase was due to a
decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement resulted from our reduced direct and indirect procurement costs, reflecting synergies associated with our
acquisition of Compaq, moderated by the declining ASPs described above. The operating expense improvement resulted from headcount reductions, tightening of administrative costs and lower research and
development expense.

The
growth in printer supplies net revenue in fiscal 2004 reflected higher volumes as a result of the continued expansion of the printer hardware installed base, due primarily to the
strong performance of color-related products and digital photography initiatives. In fiscal 2004, the growth in business printer hardware net revenue was attributable to unit volume growth in color
laser printers, business inkjet printers, monochrome laser printers and the increasing demand for multi-function printers. A continued shift in demand to lower-priced products and a competitive
pricing environment moderated the net revenue increase in business printer hardware during the period. Net revenue remained unchanged in digital imaging products as a result of growth in camera unit
shipments, offset by a decrease in sales of scanners due to a declining market. The decline in home printer hardware was driven by decreases in ASPs due to the continued shift in demand to
lower-priced products, particularly in the sub-$200 all-in-one market, as well as a decline in sales of single-function devices.

In
fiscal 2004, earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue were 15.9%, consistent with fiscal 2003. As a percentage of net revenue, both operating expense and gross margin
remained flat in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Gross margin improvement in supplies was due in part to cost reductions and volume increases moderated by a mix shift to lower margin products.
Gross margin improvement also was the result of favorable mix shifts in home printer hardware. Gross margin
declines in digital imaging and business printer hardware, due in part to a shift to lower margin products in an increasingly competitive pricing environment, moderated the improvement. Within total
operating expense, there was a slight increase in administrative expense, offset by a slight decline in selling costs, while both research and development costs and marketing costs, as a percentage of
net revenue, remained flat for fiscal 2004.

In
fiscal 2003, growth in printer supplies net revenue reflected higher volumes as a result of continued expansion of the printer hardware installed base. Sales of color and
low-end monochrome printers as well as multi-function printers and digital press products drove the net revenue increase in business printer hardware during the period. A continued shift
in demand to lower-priced products and a competitive pricing environment moderated the net revenue increase in business printer hardware during the period. Net revenue growth in digital imaging
products in fiscal 2003 was attributable to sales of newly introduced cameras and Photosmart printers that were part of the segment's consumer launch in the last half of fiscal 2002 and new models of
cameras and Photosmart printers introduced in the consumer launch in fiscal 2003, offset in part by a decrease in sales of scanners due to the declining


scanner
market. The net revenue increase in home printer hardware in fiscal 2003 was attributable to a significant volume increase in all-in-one devices, as well as a shift
from single-function printers to multi-function devices. Decreases in ASPs due to the continued shift in demand to lower-priced products, particularly in the sub-$200
all-in-one market, as well as decreases in sales of single-function devices, moderated home printer net hardware revenue growth during the period.

In
fiscal 2003, IPG's earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue were 15.9% compared to 16.5% in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, the 0.6 net percentage point decrease in
earnings from operations ratio consisted of a 0.8 percentage point increase in operating expense as a percentage of revenue, offset by an improvement in gross margin of 0.2 percentage
points. The increase in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue was driven mainly by increased marketing costs associated with a company-wide product branding campaign and selling
costs associated with an increased focus on commercial sales in the segment, as well as unfavorable currency impacts. Gross margin improved due primarily to a mix of less low margin hardware, an
increase in the supplies business, which typically has gross margins that exceed the segment average, becoming a greater percentage of total segment net revenue, as well as a favorable currency impact
on net revenue resulting from the strengthening of the euro as noted above offset partially the operating expense ratio increase. Gross margin decline in business printer hardware and digital imaging
products reflecting a shift to lower priced printing and imaging products and continued competitive pricing offset partially the gross margin improvement.

HPFS
net revenue decreased 1% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The decrease resulted primarily from lower average levels of revenue-generating assets and lower used equipment
sales. The decrease in average assets was due to portfolio amortization and asset sales exceeding new lease originations throughout most of the year. Lower interest rates also contributed to the net
revenue decrease.


In
fiscal 2004, the 2.5 net percentage point increase in the earnings from operations ratio consisted of a 1.3 percentage point increase in gross margin and a
1.2 percentage point decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin improvement was driven by higher portfolio profitability resulting primarily from end of
lease transactions and, to a lesser extent, lower interest costs as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin increase was offset in part by higher reserves related to certain aged receivables,
particularly in Europe, the Middle East and Africa ("EMEA") in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Cost savings achieved through continued cost controls, offset in part by an unfavorable currency
impact, caused the decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue.

The
acquisition of Compaq caused a substantial portion of the fluctuation in HPFS operating results in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002. The acquisition resulted in higher
revenue-generating assets; however, a slowdown in lease originations moderated the net revenue increase. In fiscal 2003, earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue improved from fiscal
2002 due to a significant reduction in bad debt expense, coupled with a decline in interest costs as a percentage of net revenue.

New
financing originations increased 2% in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003. The increase resulted from higher levels of financing in Asia Pacific and a favorable currency impact,
offset in part by a lower penetration rate of HP sales. Originations increased 8% in fiscal 2003 from fiscal 2002 due to the acquisition of Compaq. The impacts of strengthened credit controls,
weakness in the global economy and lower average selling prices of HP products offset in part the increase in originations.

Portfolio Assets and Ratios

HPFS is a financial services organization and, as such, maintains a strategy to generate a competitive return on equity by effectively leveraging its portfolio
against the risks associated with interest rates and credit. The HPFS business model is asset-intensive, and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services
companies, including a segment balance sheet that is derived from HP's internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive these amounts are substantially the same as those
used by the consolidated company. However, certain intercompany loans and accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in HP's Consolidated Financial Statements. A reconciliation
of segment assets to consolidated total assets


is
included in Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. The portfolio assets and ratios derived from the segment balance sheet for HPFS were as follows at

of intercompany leases, both of which are eliminated in consolidation.

Portfolio
assets at October 31, 2004 increased 3% from the end of fiscal 2003. The increase resulted from higher financing originations and a favorable currency impact. The
percentage of portfolio assets reserved increased in fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher reserves related to certain aged receivables in EMEA, offset in part by the write-off of assets covered by
specific reserves.

HPFS
funds its operations mainly through a combination of intercompany debt and working capital. The portfolio assets and ratios are derived from the segment balance sheet. The increase
in the debt to equity ratio reflects a planned increase in portfolio leverage.

HPFS
combined company net revenue declined 8% in fiscal 2003. Lower lease originations during fiscal 2003 contributed to the decrease in net revenue. Strengthened credit controls and the
ongoing weakness in the global economy resulted in the decrease in lease originations and the related decrease in revenue-generating assets. Decreases in ASPs of HP products also were a factor in the
decrease in lease originations in fiscal 2003. Increased revenue from used equipment sales and other mid-term and end-of-term portfolio activities moderated the net
revenue decrease.


Combined
company earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue were 4.1% in fiscal 2003 compared to a loss of 6.1% in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, a reduction in bad debt
expense for customer write-offs resulting from strengthened global credit standards and a stronger portfolio resulted in the majority of the operating profit ratio improvement. Lower
interest costs as a percentage of net revenue also had a positive impact on the ratio.

In
fiscal 2004, the majority of the net revenue in this segment related to network infrastructure products, which grew 27% from fiscal 2003 and was the result of continued enhancements
in the overall product portfolio, particularly in gigabit Ethernet switch products. In fiscal year 2003, the year-over-year net revenue growth in network infrastructure products was 18% due to
increased volumes from a new product platform.

In
fiscal 2004, expenses related to corporate development, global alliances and HP Labs increased 10% from the prior fiscal year. The increase was the result in part of increased
investment in strategic initiatives. In fiscal 2003, expenses related to corporate development, global alliances and HP Labs decreased 13% from fiscal 2002 due to the winding down of several
incubation programs. These expenses contributed to the majority of the loss in this segment's results. These expenses were offset in part by operating profit from network infrastructure product sales
for all of the periods presented. Operating profit for the network infrastructure product group declined slightly in fiscal 2004 due mostly to increased operating expense levels, primarily related to
headcount growth in research and
development, sales and marketing. Operating profit from network infrastructure product sales increased in fiscal 2003 due in part to the successful launch of a new platform of modular Ethernet
switches, which reduced the overall operating loss for Corporate Investments for that year.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004

Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside the United States. Most of the amounts held
outside the United States could be repatriated to the United States, but, under current law, would be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation
of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. HP has provided for the United States federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes, except for foreign earnings that
are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the United States.

The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, enacted on October 22, 2004 (the "Jobs Act"), provides for a temporary 85% dividends received deduction on certain foreign earnings
repatriated during a one-year period. The deduction would result in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings. To qualify for the deduction, the earnings must be reinvested in
the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company's chief executive officer and


approved
by its board of directors. Certain other criteria in the Jobs Act must be satisfied as well. The maximum amount of HP's foreign earnings that qualify for the temporary deduction is
$14.5 billion. For HP, the one-year period during which the qualifying distributions can be made is fiscal 2005.

HP
is in the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate any foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act and, if so, the amount that it will repatriate. The
range of reasonably possible amounts that HP is considering for repatriation, which would be eligible for the temporary deduction, is zero to $14.5 billion. HP is awaiting the issuance of
further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions in the Jobs Act prior to determining the amounts it will repatriate. If such regulatory
guidance or technical corrections are favorable, HP is likely to repatriate amounts in the high end of our range. HP expects to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated,
if any, during the third quarter of fiscal 2005. Use of the funds will be governed by a domestic reinvestment plan, as required by the Jobs Act.

Repatriation
of the maximum amount eligible for the temporary deduction, which is $14.5 billion, could result in additional United States federal income tax expense, which HP
currently estimates to be between $850 million and $925 million, in fiscal 2005. Repatriation also would substantially increase liquidity in the United States, although use of the
additional liquidity would be restricted by the domestic reinvestment plan. There would be a corresponding reduction in liquidity at HP's foreign subsidiaries. Some foreign subsidiaries would be
required to borrow in order to repatriate their earnings to the U.S. We expect HP's significant positive foreign cash flows would be sufficient to repay any foreign debt and replenish foreign cash
balances over time. Should HP decide not to repatriate foreign earnings under the Jobs Act, we would meet United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowing, or both. We
utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

Our total cash and cash equivalents declined approximately 11%, to $12.7 billion at October 31, 2004 from $14.2 billion at the end of fiscal
2003. Year-over-year net borrowings also declined 5.8%, or $440 million, to $7.1 billion at October 31, 2004. Improved net earnings in fiscal 2004 helped
generate $5.1 billion in cash from operating activities. The cash generated by operations in fiscal 2004 funded nearly 77% of the $6.6 billion in fiscal 2004 investing and financing
activities, with the remaining 23% coming from cash reserves due to our strong cash position. The $6.6 billion used for investing and financing activities includes $4.4 billion for share
repurchases and acquisitions during fiscal 2004, compared to $900 million of share repurchases and acquisitions in fiscal 2003. Our cash position remains strong and, as previously discussed,
our liquidity in the United States may improve in fiscal 2005 due to HP's alternatives under the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act.

Cash conversion cycle




Days
of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable, net of
allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average net revenue.

Days
of supply in inventory ("DOS") measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing inventory by a 90-day average cost of goods
sold.

Days
of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("DPO") measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing accounts
payable by a 90-day average cost of goods sold.

Our
working capital requirements depend upon our effective management of the cash conversion cycle, which represents effectively the number of days from the purchase of raw materials, to
the collection of cash from our customers. The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO.

2004 Compared to 2003

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities declined by 16% during fiscal 2004. Although our cash position benefited from higher earnings, lower payments for
restructuring actions and decreased pension and other post-retirement contributions, these improvements were not sufficient to offset the increase in the cash conversion cycle, which rose
to 30 days in fiscal 2004 compared to 21 days in fiscal 2003.

The
lengthening of the cash conversion cycle was due largely to a $2.3 billion increase in accounts receivable and inventory at October 31, 2004 as compared to the prior
year and the timing of accounts payable payments. Accounts receivable was impacted unfavorably by currency fluctuations as the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro and a change in the mix of the
accounts receivable portfolio. The October 31, 2004 portfolio included a larger portion of U.S. retail and European direct receivables,


which
generally have longer payment terms compared to the shorter payment terms of commercial receivables. Higher inventory levels at October 31, 2004 reflect planned increases in certain
inventories in preparation for the 2004 holiday season as well as a change in the timing of new product rollouts, particularly within IPG and PSG. HP introduced these products on a staggered basis
during the latter half of fiscal 2004, with certain IPG products rolled out in the first month of fiscal 2005, as compared to the more focused marketing rollout in the third quarter of fiscal 2003. In
addition, ESS inventory levels increased due primarily to backlog associated with industry standard servers, which occurred as a result of component availability at quarter end.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities rose by 62% primarily due to $1.1 billion spent for several business acquisitions, including Triaton GmbH, Synstar
plc and Digital GlobalSoft Limited, during fiscal 2004 as compared to the $149 million spent on acquisitions in fiscal 2003. Capital expenditures increased only slightly, by 7%, during fiscal
2004, with the increase mostly offset by asset disposition activities.

Financing Activities

The significant increase in net cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2004 resulted from a higher level of share repurchases compared to fiscal 2003.
The increase in share repurchases during 2004 reflects our confidence in our long-term growth and profitability. We repurchase shares of our common stock under a systematic program to
manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and for other purposes. This program authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. During fiscal year
2004 HP's Board of Directors authorized $5.0 billion for future repurchases of outstanding shares, including $3.0 billion authorized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. We completed
share repurchases of approximately 172 million shares for $3.3 billion in fiscal 2004, including approximately 72 million shares under an accelerated share repurchase program, as
compared to repurchases of 40 million shares for $751 million in fiscal 2003. In November 2004, the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we closed the accelerated share repurchase program for a
final average purchase price of $18.82 per share. At the price levels at which we have been repurchasing shares, we believe the HP shares represent an attractive investment. We intend to continue to
repurchase shares opportunistically as a means of returning cash to stockholders as well as offsetting dilution from the issuance of shares under employee benefit plans. As of October 31, 2004,
we had remaining authorization of approximately $2.9 billion for future share repurchases.

Proceeds
from the issuance of stock options and shares sold to employees under the stock purchase plan were $570 million, or 18% higher in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003,
mainly because of higher overall market prices during fiscal 2004. Also during fiscal 2004, borrowing activity as compared to the prior fiscal year was significantly reduced. Net debt repayments in
fiscal 2004 totaled $448 million and reflected lower net levels of commercial paper borrowings and current maturities payable. Fiscal 2003 borrowings activity included the issuance of debt as
well as repayments, which on a net repayment basis totaled $303 million.


2003 Compared to 2002

Operating Activities

The increase in net cash provided by operations in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 resulted primarily from higher earnings compared to a loss in fiscal
2002, as well as an increase in accounts payable. Improved management of the payables function and a contract manufacturing transition for some of our laptop products to China contributed to the
increase in accounts payable at the end of fiscal 2003. Increases in inventory, continued severance payments through our restructuring programs, pension contributions and increases in receivables from
contract manufacturers offset partially the increases in cash flow provided from operations.

Investing Activities

The change in net cash flows from investing activities from fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to the $3.6 billion of cash acquired
in the Compaq acquisition in fiscal 2002, as well as $879 million recorded upon the dissolution of our equity method investment in Liquidity Management Corporation ("LMC"), when it became a
wholly-owned subsidiary on November 1, 2001. In addition, net capital expenditures were $1.6 billion in fiscal 2003 as compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2002. Capital expenditure
increases in fiscal 2003 related mainly to assets under lease by HPFS to third parties and to continued investment in IPG manufacturing equipment. In fiscal 2002, capital expenditures related
primarily to financing assets and manufacturing investments across our businesses. HPFS capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Compaq
in the third quarter of fiscal 2002.

The slight decrease in net cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 was due primarily to a decrease in net repayments of total
debt to approximately $303 million in fiscal 2003 compared to net repayments of $472 million in fiscal 2002 and, to a lesser extent, from an increase in cash generated by issuances of
common stock under various employee stock plans. These increases were offset in part by an increase in repurchases of approximately 40 million shares for $751 million in fiscal 2003 and
40 million shares for $671 million in fiscal 2002.

LIQUIDITY

As previously discussed, we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity, since we believe that internally generated cash flows are
sufficient to support business operations, capital
expenditures and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to a level of discretionary investments and share repurchases. We are able to supplement this near term liquidity, if necessary, with
broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities through various foreign subsidiaries as well as with U.S. financial institutions.

We
maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including
acquisitions), share repurchase activities and the overall cost of capital. Outstanding debt at fiscal year end 2004 decreased to $7.1 billion as compared to $7.6 billion at fiscal year
end 2003, bearing weighted average interest rates of 5.3% and 5.2%, respectively. Short-term borrowings increased to $2.5 billion at October 31, 2004 from $1.1 billion
at October 31, 2003. The increase reflects $1.5 billion of Global Notes maturing in 2005. In addition, during fiscal 2004, we issued $4.1 billion and repaid $4.3 billion of


commercial
paper. HP did not issue long-term debt during fiscal 2004, although HP assumed insignificant amounts in association with our acquisitions.

We
entered into a six-year revolving agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 to sell certain trade receivables without recourse. Sold receivables are then collected
by the third party, with the sales of receivables limited only by the outstanding maximum balance of receivables not yet collected by the third party. Trade receivables of approximately
680 million euros were sold during fiscal 2004, primarily during the fourth quarter. As of October 31, 2004, the aggregate receivables sold but not yet collected by the third party were
approximately 253 million euros, compared to the maximum amount of 600 million euros permitted under the agreement at that date. The implementation of this agreement did not have a
material impact on HP's DSO as utilization of this program was limited to certain customer receivables that HP already managed under an alternative prompt payment program. Fees associated with this
program do not differ materially from the cash discounts offered to these customers under the alternative prompt payment program.

We
have the following resources available to obtain short-term or long-term financings, if we need additional liquidity:

The
securities issuable under the 2002 registration statement include notes with due dates of nine months or more from issuance. HP uses U.S. credit facilities for general corporate
purposes, including to support our U.S. commercial paper program. We have begun talks with lenders to renegotiate or replace the 364-day credit facility expiring in March 2005. The lines of credit are
uncommitted and are primarily available through various foreign subsidiaries.

We
do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt. However, a downgrade in our credit rating would increase the cost of
borrowings under our credit facilities. Also, a downgrade in our credit rating could limit or, in the case of a significant downgrade, preclude our ability to issue commercial paper under our current
programs. If this occurs, we would seek alternative sources of funding, including the issuance of notes under our existing shelf registration statement and our Euro Medium-Term Note
Programme or our credit facilities.


HP,
and not the HPFS financing business, issued or assumed the vast majority of HP's total outstanding debt. HPFS is a financial services organization and, like other financial services
companies, has a business model that is asset-intensive in nature and therefore is more debt-dependent than our other business segments. At October 31, 2004, HPFS had approximately
$7.1 billion in net portfolio assets, which include short- and long-term financing receivables and operating lease assets.

Contractual Obligations

(2)

Purchase
obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on HP and that specify all significant terms, including
fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable
without penalty. These purchase obligations are related principally to cost of sales, inventory and other items.

(3)

As
a result of our approved restructuring plans, we expect future cash expenditures of approximately $294 million, primarily for employee severance and other
employee benefits and facilities costs. Of this amount, $288 million is recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2004, and $6 million will be expensed in future
periods as the costs are incurred or the requirements to record the costs as a liability are met.

In
addition to the contractual obligations noted in the table above, we also have the following funding commitments.

In
fiscal 2004, we made contributions of approximately $564 million to our pension plans and $49 million to our post-retirement benefit plans, for a total of
$613 million, compared to a total of approximately $1.2 billion in fiscal 2003. We estimate that we will contribute a total of approximately $910 million to the pension and
post-retirement plans during fiscal 2005. Our funding policy is to contribute cash to our pension plans so that we meet the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local
government funding and taxing authorities. In the current fiscal year, we will continue to contribute cash to our global pension plans in amounts that are consistent with local funding requirements
and tax considerations.


We
issued approximately 53 million non-transferable contingent value rights ("CVRs") in connection with our acquisition of Indigo that entitle each holder to a
one-time contingent cash payment of up to $4.50 per CVR, based on the achievement of certain cumulative revenue results over a three-year period. The future cash
pay-out, if any, of the CVRs will be payable after a three-year period that began on April 1, 2002 and could result in a maximum obligation of $237 million. HP
has not incurred a liability associated with CVRs as of October 31, 2004.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as
entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities ("SPEs"), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or
other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of October 31, 2004, we are not involved in any material unconsolidated SPE transactions.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any
losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or
claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.

FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future
performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margin and prospects.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors may target our key market segments. We
compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution, range of products and services, account relationships, customer service and support,
security, and availability of application software. If our products, services, support and cost structure do not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, it could harm our
operations, results and prospects. Further, we may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time trying to maintain or improve
revenue and gross margin. Because our business model is based on providing innovative and high quality products, we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of
our competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be
adversely affected. In addition, if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain
areas, which could adversely affect our revenue and prospects. Even if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, revenue could decline due to increased competition
from other types of products or because the product is in a maturing industry. Industry consolidation may affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially


stronger
competitors in the markets in which we compete, and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers.

If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may
suffer.

The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure
by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. We must make long-term
investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and
services. After we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low costs. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mix of products and
configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at all or within a given product's life cycle. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product could
result in our not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position. In addition, in the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues
associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and manufacturing processes, as well as defects in third party components included in our products. In order to
address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine the cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions. However, we may
have limited ability to control quality issues,
particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or "patch"), we may delay
shipment to customers, which would delay revenue recognition and could adversely affect our revenue and reported results. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in
additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting our profits. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our
reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.

If we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions, our revenue may suffer.

Many of the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance, software functionality and features;
frequent introduction of new products; short product life cycles; and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance. If we do not make an effective transition
from existing products and services to future offerings, our revenue may decline. Among the risks associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or
manufacturing, variations in costs, delays in customer purchases in anticipation of new introductions, difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and effectively managing inventory
levels in line with anticipated demand, risks associated with customer qualification and evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be
supported adequately by application software. Our revenue and gross margin also may suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors. This is especially
challenging when a product has a short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction. Furthermore, sales of our new products and services may replace
sales, or result in discounting, of some of our current offerings, offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction. There also may be overlaps in the current products and services of HP and
portfolios acquired through mergers and acquisitions that we must


manage.
In addition, it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue, margin and cost estimates, and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in
our estimates. Given the competitive nature of our industry, if any of these risks materialize, future demand for our products and services and our results of operations may suffer.

Our revenue, cost of sales, and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third
parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees,
customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. However, any of our direct or indirect
intellectual property rights could be challenged,
invalidated or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which
could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect our proprietary rights to
the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or
use, which could adversely affect our competitive position. Also, because of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, much of our business and many of our
products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by third parties, and we may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on
reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses. Third parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Even if
we believe that the claims are without merit, the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of
intellectual property infringement also might require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards. Even if we have an agreement to
indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual agreements to us. If we cannot or do not license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms
or substitute similar technology from another source, our operations could suffer. Further, our costs of operations could be affected on an ongoing basis by the imposition of copyright levies or
similar fees by rights holders or collection agencies in certain jurisdictions, primarily in Europe. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition transaction third
parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction. Consequently, we may
lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these agreements.

Economic uncertainty could affect adversely, our revenue, gross margin and expenses.

Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for computing and imaging products and services in the markets in
which we compete. Economic weakness and constrained IT spending has previously resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and problems with
our ability to manage inventory levels and realize customer receivables. In addition, customer financial difficulties have previously resulted, and could result in the future, in increases in bad debt
write-offs and additions to reserves in our receivables portfolio, inability by our lessees to make required lease payments and


reduction
in the value of leased equipment upon its return to us compared to the value estimated at lease inception. We also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross margin declines
in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures, inventory write-downs, charges associated with the cancellation of planned production line expansion, and
increases in pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses and impairment of investments. Uncertainty
about future economic conditions makes it difficult to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a
material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results of operations, prospects and stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts and wars may seriously harm our business and revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts or wars (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to HP, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers,
distributors, resellers or customers, which could significantly impact our revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition. Terrorist attacks create many economic and political uncertainties, some
of which may materially harm our business and results of operations. The potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security,
and other actual or potential conflicts or wars, including the ongoing military operations in Iraq, have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business,
results of operations and stock price in ways that we cannot presently predict. In addition, as a major multi-national company with headquarters and significant operations located in the United
States, actions against or by the United States may impact our business or employees. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts, conflicts and wars.

Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition.

Sales outside the United States make up more than half of our revenue. Our future revenue, gross margin, expenses and financial condition also could suffer due to
a variety of international factors, including:

•

ongoing
instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or
anticipated military or political conflicts;

•

currency
fluctuations, particularly in the euro and the Japanese yen, which contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions and also
affect our reported results expressed in U.S. dollars;

•

longer
accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers;

•

trade
regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products;


•

local
labor conditions and regulations;

•

changes
in the regulatory or legal environment;

•

differing
technology standards or customer requirements;

•

import,
export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could affect our ability to obtain favorable
terms for components or lead to penalties or restrictions;

•

difficulties
associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws;

•

fluctuations
in freight costs and disruptions at important geographic points of exit and entry;

•

natural
disasters, such as earthquakes, tsunamis and typhoons; and

•

medical
disasters, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.

The factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we
rely on manufacturers in Taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture.

Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.

Our worldwide operations could be subject to natural disasters and other business disruptions, which could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and
increase our costs and expenses. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our
suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults. The ultimate impact on us, our significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake
faults is unknown, but our revenue, profitability and financial condition could suffer in the event of a major earthquake and related natural disasters. In addition, some areas, including California
and parts of the East Coast and Midwest of the United States, have previously experienced, and may experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause
disruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers. We are predominantly self-insured for losses and interruptions caused by
earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, typhoons, fires, extreme weather conditions and other natural or manmade disasters.

If we fail to manage distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margin and profitability could suffer.

We use a variety of different distribution methods to sell our products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and both direct and
indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach all of the potential customer segments for our
products and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most


advantageous
balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore profitability. Other distribution risks are described below.

•

Our financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to
weaken.

Our
future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels, the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or
the loss of retail shelf space. Moreover, some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions,
including economic weakness and industry consolidation. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer and we could experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors' financial conditions or
operations weaken.

•

Our inventory management will be complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors.

We
must manage inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues. Distributors may increase orders during periods of
product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and
the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues, and
therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our
willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by competitors. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to
price our products effectively.

We depend on third party suppliers, and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage supplier issues properly.

Our manufacturing operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components and products and our suppliers' ability to deliver sufficient quantities
of quality components and products at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical manufacturing and distribution schedules. Given the wide variety of systems, products and services that we
offer, the large number of our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe, and the long lead times that are required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain
components and products, problems could arise in planning production and managing inventory levels that could seriously harm us. We also rely on third party suppliers for the provision of contingent
workers, and our failure to manage our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We also could be exposed to various legal claims relating to their status.
Other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess supply and risks related to fixed-price contracts that would require us to pay more than the open market price, as
described below.

•

Shortages.

Occasionally we may experience a shortage of, or a delay in receiving, certain supplies as a result
of strong demand, capacity constraints or other problems experienced by suppliers. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these supplies may increase, we may be exposed to quality issues or the
supplies may not be available at all. We may not be able to secure enough supplies at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide


services
in a timely manner in the quantities or specifications needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional
freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to reengineer some products or service offerings, resulting in
further costs and delays.

•

Oversupply.

In order to secure supplies for the provision of products or services or to secure workers in
critical areas, at times we may make advance payments to suppliers, or we may enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a
temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components or we could have an oversupply of workers in certain areas, any of which could adversely affect our gross margin. Our ability to
manage the size of, and costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.

•

Long-term pricing commitments.

As a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors, we
may be obligated to purchase supplies or services or to retain workers at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market
conditions. In the event that we become committed to purchase supplies or to retain workers for prices in excess of the current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access
to components or workers at lower prices, and our gross margin could suffer. Our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate our supplier issues. We obtain a significant
number of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. In addition, new products that we introduce may utilize custom components obtained
from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for additional suppliers. The performance of such single source suppliers may affect the quality, quantity and price of
supplies to HP.

Impairment of our investment portfolio could harm our net earnings.

We have an investment portfolio that includes minority equity and debt investments. In most cases, we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on
these investments and may incur losses related to the impairment of these investments and therefore charges to net earnings. Some of our investments are in public and privately-held
companies that are still in the start-up or development stage, which have inherent risks because the technologies or products they have under development never may become successful.
Furthermore, the values of our investments in publicly-traded companies are subject to significant market price volatility. We often couple our investments in technology companies with a strategic
commercial relationship. Our commercial agreements with these companies may not be sufficient to allow us to obtain and integrate such products and services into our offerings or otherwise benefit
from the relationship, and third parties, including competitors, subsequently may acquire these companies. Economic weakness could impact our investment portfolio in the future.

The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied.

Our revenue and profit margins vary among our products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will be different in future periods than
our current revenue and profit margins. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net
revenue. In particular, IPG and certain of its business units such as printer supplies contribute significantly to our profitability. Certain segments, and ESS in particular, have a higher fixed cost
structure than others and may experience


significant
operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis. In addition, newer geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and
local pricing pressures. Market trends, competitive pressures, seasonal rebates, increased component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or
pressure on gross margins in a given period, which may necessitate adjustments to our operations.

Unanticipated changes in HP's tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the
allocation of expenses in different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in
countries with differing statutory tax rates, in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or in tax laws or by material audit assessments, which could affect our profitability. In
particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. In addition,
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability. Further, if we elect to
repatriate cash held outside the United States pursuant to The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, our tax rate may increase even if by a lesser amount than without such legislation.

Our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.

Our quarterly sales have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of such quarters' total sales occur toward the end of such quarter, and this
trend has become more pronounced in recent periods. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue, earnings and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of
unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition, and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders,
there will be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter. Other
developments late in a quarter, such as a systems failure, component pricing movements or global logistics disruptions, could adversely impact inventory levels and results of operations in a manner
that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected. In addition, we experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products. For example, sales to governments (particularly
sales to the U.S. government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal and calendar years are
the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year. European sales are
often weaker during the summer months. Demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. Moreover, to the extent that we introduce new
products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches. Overall, our third
fiscal quarter is typically our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter our strongest. Many of the factors that create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.


Any failure by us to execute planned cost reductions successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected.

Historically, we have undertaken restructuring plans to bring operational expenses to appropriate levels for each of our businesses, while simultaneously
implementing extensive new
company-wide expense-control programs. In connection with the Compaq acquisition and other cost alignment efforts, we announced workforce restructurings as well as reductions through our
early retirement programs involving approximately 26,200 employees worldwide in fiscal 2003 and 2002. Hiring in key areas offset some of these workforce reductions. We expect additional workforce
reductions in the first half of 2005, and we may have further workforce reductions in the future. Significant risks associated with these actions and other workforce management issues that may impair
our ability to achieve anticipated cost reductions or that may otherwise harm our business include delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside of
the United States, particularly in Europe and Asia, redundancies among restructuring programs, decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees,
particularly sales employees.

In order to be successful, we must retain and motivate key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

In order to be successful, we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing and IT
support positions. In particular, hiring and retaining qualified engineers, skilled solutions providers in the IT support business and qualified sales representatives is critical to our future.
Competition for experienced management and technical, sales, marketing and support personnel in the IT industry can be intense. The loss of key employees could have a significant impact on our
operations and stock price. We also must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on HP's strategies and goals.

Decreased effectiveness of equity compensation could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees, and proposed changes in accounting for equity compensation
could adversely affect earnings.

We have historically used stock options and other forms of equity-related compensation as key components of our total rewards employee compensation program in
order to align employees' interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention, and provide competitive compensation packages. In recent periods, many of HP's employee stock
options have had exercise prices in excess of HP's stock price, which reduces their value to employees and could affect our ability to retain or attract present and prospective employees. In addition,
the Financial Accounting Standards Board and other agencies have finalized changes to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles that will require HP and other companies to record a charge to
earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives. Moreover, applicable stock exchange listing standards relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity compensation plans
could make it more difficult or expensive for us to grant options to employees in the future. As a result, we may incur increased compensation costs, change our equity compensation strategy or find it
difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.


HP's stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate.

HP's stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. Some of the factors that can affect our stock price are:

•

the
announcement of new products, services or technological innovations by us or our competitors;

•

quarterly
increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin or earnings, and changes in the business, organizational structure, operations or prospects of HP or any of its
business units;

•

changes
in quarterly revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community and variations between actual and anticipated financial results; and

•

speculation
in the press or investment community about our strategic position, financial condition, financial reporting, results of operations, business acquisitions or
significant transactions.

General
or industry-specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to HP's performance also may
affect the price of HP common stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, or results of operations or cash flows. In
addition, following periods of volatility in a company's securities, securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted. This type of litigation could result in substantial
costs and the diversion of management time and resources.

System security risks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers, which could harm our
revenue, increase our expenses and harm our reputation and stock price.

Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third
parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. As a result, we could incur significant expenses in addressing problems created by security breaches of our network. Moreover, we could lose
existing or potential customers for information technology outsourcing services or other information technology solutions, or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers' system
failures. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture, including
"bugs" and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems, viruses and bugs could be significant, and the
efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays or cessation of service that may impede sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.

Portions
of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems integration work. In particular,
in connection with the Compaq integration, we are in the process of implementing new general ledger, order management and data warehouse systems to replace our current systems. As a part of this
effort, we are rationalizing various legacy systems, upgrading existing software applications and implementing new data management applications to administer our business information. We may not be
successful in implementing the new systems, and transitioning data and other aspects of the process could be expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource intensive. Any disruptions that may
occur in the


implementation
of the new systems or any future systems could adversely affect our ability to report in an accurate and timely manner the results of our consolidated operations, our business segment
results, our financial position and cash flows. Disruptions to these systems also could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other operational processes. Delayed sales, lower
margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, stock price and reputation.

Any failure by us to manage acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and prospects.

As part of our business strategy, we frequently engage in discussions with third parties regarding, and enter into agreements relating to, possible acquisitions,
strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and outsourcing transactions in order to further our business objectives, and in many cases, to manage our product and technology portfolios. In order
to pursue this strategy successfully, we must identify suitable candidates for these transactions, complete these transactions, some of which may be large and
complex, and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. Integration and other risks of acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and
outsourcing transactions can be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions, or if multiple transactions are pursued simultaneously. However, if we fail to identify and complete
successfully transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may
be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and selling, general and administrative expenses. Integration issues are complex,
time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. The challenges involved in integration include:

•

combining
product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;

•

convincing
customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus, preventing customers and distributors from deferring
purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers (which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty), and coordinating sales, marketing and
distribution efforts;

•

consolidating
and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code;

•

minimizing
the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;

•

persuading
employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, integrating employees into HP, correctly estimating
employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs;

•

coordinating
and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third parties in
accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;

•

achieving
savings from supply chain integration; and

•

managing
integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.


We
evaluate and enter into significant transactions, including acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, divestitures and outsourcing agreements, on an ongoing basis. We may not
fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any transaction to the extent anticipated, and the timeframe for achieving benefits of a transaction may depend partially upon the actions of
employees, suppliers or other third parties. In addition, the pricing and other terms of our contracts for significant transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter
into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate our costs accurately. Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated
delays or failure to achieve contractual obligations could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable.

Managing
acquisitions, outsourcing transactions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, and divestitures requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention
from other business operations. These transactions also have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay,
early retirement costs, employee benefit costs, asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, IPR&D charges, inventory adjustments, legal, accounting
and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans. Moreover, HP has incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization
expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in
connection with a transaction becomes impaired, we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. In order to complete an acquisition, we may issue
common stock, potentially creating dilution for existing stockholders, or borrow, affecting our financial condition and potentially our credit ratings. Any prior or future downgrades in our credit
rating associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. In addition, HP's effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain
and extraordinary transactions could impact our effective tax rate. As a result, any completed, pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment
community's expectations in a given quarter.

Unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings.

Some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state and international laws governing the environment, including those governing the
discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Many of our products are subject to various
federal, state and international laws governing chemical substances in products, including those regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and those restricting the presence
of certain substances in electronics products. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property damage or personal injury claims
if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws. We also face increasing complexity in our product design
and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including the restrictions on lead and certain other substances that will
apply to specified electronics products put on the market in the European Union as of July 1, 2006 (Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive) and similar legislation currently proposed for
China. The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict, and liability under some environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed
retroactively and on a joint and several basis. We also could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. The European Union


has
finalized the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, which makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for specified collection,
recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. This deadline to enact and implement the directive by individual European Union governments generally was August 13, 2004,
although extensions were granted to some countries (such legislation, together with the directive, the "WEEE Legislation"), and producers are to financially responsible under the WEEE Legislation
beginning in August 2005. HP's potential liability resulting from the WEEE Legislation may be substantial. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other geographies, including in the
United States and Japan, the cumulative impact of which could be significant. It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside and outside the United States,
even when we are not subject to local government regulations. We record a liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs when we consider the costs to be probable and the amount
of the costs can be reasonably estimated.

Some anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.

We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition
deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions:

•

authorizing
blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;

•

limiting
the liability of, and providing indemnification to, directors and officers;

•

specifying
that stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the
ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;

•

requiring
advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of HP stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of
Directors;

•

requiring
a two-thirds stockholder vote to amend certain bylaws relating to stockholder meetings, the Board of Directors and indemnification; and

•

controlling
the procedures for conduct of Board and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of directors.

These
provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or management of HP. As a Delaware corporation, HP also is subject to
provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of
the holders of substantially all of HP's outstanding common stock.

Any
provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our
stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of HP common stock, and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for HP common stock.


ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position
results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivatives only to manage existing underlying
exposures of HP. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy, and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of changes in fair
values for each of these exposures are outlined below.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

During the preceding fiscal year, we were exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated
purchases and assets, liabilities and debt denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to our
operations for the preceding fiscal year were the euro, the Japanese yen and the British pound. For most currencies we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker
U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where HP is a net receiver, certain expense figures taken alone may be adversely affected by a
weaker U.S. dollar. We use a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net
revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, HP may use swaps to exchange the
foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. HP also uses other derivatives not
designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. HP recognizes the gains and losses on foreign
currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency-denominated exposures. Alternatively, HP may choose not to hedge the foreign
currency risk associated with its foreign currency exposures if such exposure acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency.

We
have performed a sensitivity analysis as of October 31, 2004 and 2003, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held
constant. The analysis covers all of our foreign currency contracts offset by the underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at
October 31, 2004 and 2003. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a loss in the fair values of our
foreign exchange derivative financial instruments, net of exposures, of $71 million at October 31, 2004 and $96 million at October 31, 2003.

Interest rate risk

During the preceding fiscal year, we also were exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables. HP issues
long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. HP then typically uses interest rate swaps to modify the market risk
exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for floating interest payments.
However, HP may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if the fixed rate positions provide a more beneficial relationship between assets
and liabilities. In order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate


investments,
HP periodically may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. HP uses cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based
interest income received on certain variable-rate investments. HP also enters into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest
returns.

We
have performed a sensitivity analysis as of October 31, 2004 and 2003, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analysis covers our debt, investment instruments, financing receivables and
interest rate swaps. The analysis uses actual maturities for the debt, investments and interest rate swaps and approximate maturities for financing receivables. The discount rates used were based on
the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2004 and 2003. The sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the
fair values of our debt and investment instruments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swap positions, of $2 million at October 31, 2004 and $7 million at
October 31, 2003.

Equity price risk

During the preceding fiscal year, we also were exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities, which had an estimated
fair value of $70 million at October 31, 2004
and $97 million at October 31, 2003. We monitor our equity investments on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of the equity investment exceeds its fair value, and the
decline in value is determined to be other-than temporary, the carrying value is reduced to its current fair value. Generally, we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure
on these equity securities. However, we may use derivative transactions to hedge certain positions from time to time. We do not purchase our equity securities with the intent to use them for trading
or speculative purposes. A hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly-traded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair values of our marketable equity securities of
$21 million at October 31, 2004 and $29 million at October 31, 2003. The aggregate cost of privately-held companies and other investments is $388 million
at October 31, 2004 and $577 million at October 31, 2003.

Actual
gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and
equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges.

Quarterly Summary



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett-Packard Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2004. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries at
October 31, 2004 and 2003, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2004, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, on November 1, 2002 the Company changed its method of accounting for goodwill and intangible assets and in
2002 the Company changed its method of depreciation for assets placed in service after May 1, 2002.

Statement of Management Responsibility

HP's management is responsible for the preparation, integrity and objectivity of the Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial information included in
HP's 2004 Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and reflect the
effects of certain estimates and judgments made by management.

HP's
management maintains an effective system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded and transactions are properly recorded and
executed in accordance with management's authorization. The system is regularly monitored by direct management review and by internal auditors who conduct an extensive program of audits throughout HP.
HP selects and trains qualified people who are provided with, and expected to adhere to, HP's Standards of Business Conduct. These standards, which set forth the highest principles of business ethics
and conduct, are a key element of HP's control system.

HP's
Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2004 have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent
auditors. Their audits were conducted in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) and included a review of financial controls and tests of
accounting records and procedures as they respectively considered necessary in the circumstances.

The
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed entirely of independent directors, meets regularly with management, the internal auditors and the independent auditors to
review accounting, reporting, auditing and internal control matters. The Audit Committee has direct and private access to both internal and external auditors.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Hewlett-Packard Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its controlled majority-owned
subsidiaries (collectively, "HP"). Equity investments in companies over which HP has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not hold a controlling interest, are accounted for under
the equity method, and HP's proportionate share of income or losses is recorded in Interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. All significant intercompany accounts and
transactions have been eliminated.

Reclassifications and Segment Reorganization

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts or balances in order to conform to the current year presentation. The long-term portion
of deferred revenue previously classified as current deferred revenue has been reclassified to Other liabilities, and the prior year presentation also has been reclassified for comparative purposes.
This reclassification did not impact HP's consolidated net revenue and also had no impact on HP's Consolidated Statements of Operations, Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or Consolidated
Statements of Stockholders' Equity for all
periods presented. As further described in Note 18, at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2004 HP's business segments were realigned. Prior period segment operating results have been
restated for all periods presented to reflect the new organizational structure.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts reported in HP's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

HP recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery occurs or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or
determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured. When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products, licenses and/or services, HP allocates revenue to
each element based on its relative fair value. Fair value for software is determined based on vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") or, in the absence of VSOE for all the elements, the residual
method when VSOE exists for all the undelivered elements. The price charged when the software is sold separately determines VSOE. In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, HP first
allocates revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. Where the fair value for an undelivered element cannot be determined, HP defers
revenue for the delivered elements until the undelivered elements are delivered. HP limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future
delivery of products or services or subject to customer-specified return or refund privileges.

HP
ceases revenue recognition on delinquent accounts based upon a number of factors, including customer credit history, number of days past due and the terms of the customer agreement.
HP resumes revenue recognition and recognizes any associated deferred revenue when appropriate customer actions are taken to remove accounts from delinquent status.


Products

Under HP's standard terms and conditions of sale, HP transfers title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is delivered to the customer and revenue
is recognized accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain. HP reduces revenue for estimated customer returns, price protection, rebates and other offerings
that occur under sales programs established by HP directly or with HP's distributors and resellers. HP recognizes revenue allocated to software licenses at the inception of the license. Revenue from
the sale of equipment under sales-type leases and direct-financing leases is recorded as product revenue at the inception of the lease. HP accrues the estimated cost of
post-sale obligations, including basic product warranties, based on historical experience at the time HP recognizes revenue.

Services

HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software post-contract support
contracts, ratably over the contract period and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred. For time and material contracts, HP recognizes revenue and costs as services are
rendered. Revenue from fixed-price consulting arrangements is recognized over the contract period on a proportional performance basis, as determined by the relationship of actual costs incurred to
date to the estimated total contract costs, with estimates regularly revised during the life of the contact. For outsourcing contracts, HP recognizes revenue ratably over the contractual service
period for fixed price contracts and on the output or consumption basis for all other outsourcing contracts. HP recognizes costs associated with outsourcing contracts as incurred, unless such costs
relate to the transition phase of the outsourcing contract, in which case HP generally amortizes those costs over the contractual service period. Losses on consulting and outsourcing arrangements are
recognized in the period that the contractual loss becomes probable and estimable. HP records amounts invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue
recognition criteria are met. HP records revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced on fixed-price contracts as trade receivables. HP recognizes revenue from operating leases
on an accrual basis as services revenue when the rental payments become due.

Financing Income

Financing income is produced by sales-type and direct-financing leases and is recognized on the accrual basis under the effective interest method.
Certain financing receivables for which HP recorded specific reserves are placed on nonaccrual status. Nonaccrual assets are those receivables with specific reserves and other delinquent accounts for
which it is likely that HP will be unable to collect
all amounts due according to the terms of the customer agreement. Income recognition is discontinued on these receivables. Financing receivables are removed from nonaccrual status when appropriate
customer actions are taken to remove the accounts from delinquent status.

Shipping and Handling

Costs related to shipping and handling are included in cost of sales for all periods presented.


Advertising

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred or when the advertising is first run and totaled approximately $1.8 billion in each of fiscal 2004 and 2003 and
$1.4 billion in fiscal 2002.

Taxes on Earnings

HP recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. HP records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is
more likely than not to be realized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

HP classifies investments as cash equivalents if the maturity of an investment is three months or less from the purchase date. Interest income was approximately
$238 million in fiscal 2004, $240 million in fiscal 2003 and $241 million in fiscal 2002.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

HP establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade and financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility. Bad debt reserves are
maintained based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, trends in overall weighted average risk rating of the total portfolio, macroeconomic conditions,
significant one-time events, historical experience and the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors and
the financial condition of customers. A specific reserve for individual accounts is recorded when HP becomes aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of
bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, estimates of the recoverability of receivables would be
further adjusted.

Inventory

Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, with cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Additions, improvements and major renewals are capitalized. Maintenance, repairs
and minor renewals are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is provided using straight-line or accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are 5
to 40 years for buildings and improvements and 3 to 10 years for machinery and equipment. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is
shorter. Equipment held for lease is depreciated over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value.

HP
uses the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment placed into service after April 30, 2002. Property, plant and equipment placed
into service prior to May 1, 2002 is depreciated using accelerated methods for buildings, improvements and the majority of machinery and


equipment.
The effect of this change was not material to HP's earnings or financial position for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," which was effective for HP for fiscal 2003, prohibits
the amortization of goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. HP reviews goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually at the
beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 142. HP
performs a two-step impairment test. In the first step, HP compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. HP determines the fair value of its reporting units based
on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, HP calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market
approach, HP estimates the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets
assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting
unit, then HP must perform the second step impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds
its implied fair value, HP records an impairment loss equal to the difference. SFAS No. 142 also requires that the fair value of the indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets be estimated
and compared to the carrying value. HP estimates the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach. HP recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the
indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets is less than the carrying value.

Long-Lived Assets Including Finite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets

Purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging
from one to ten years.

Long-lived
assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives, are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." HP
assesses the fair value of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flow the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow
expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When an impairment is identified, HP
reduces the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values.

Capitalized Software

HP capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system
interfaces, and installation and testing


of
the software. Capitalized costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally from one to three years.

Derivative Financial Instruments

HP uses derivative financial instruments, including forwards, swaps, and options, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. Other derivatives
not designated as hedges may also be used by HP, primarily forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures and warrants in companies invested in as part of strategic relationships. HP
does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. See Note 8 for a full description of HP's derivative financial instrument activities and related accounting policies.

Investments

HP's investments consist principally of time deposits, repurchase agreements, municipal securities, other debt securities and equity securities of
publicly-held and privately-held
companies. Investments with maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments.

HP's
investments in debt securities and its equity investments in public companies are classified as available-for-sale securities and carried at fair value. Fair
values for investments in public companies are determined using quoted market prices. The unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of taxes, are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.

Equity
investments in privately-held companies are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. Fair values for investments in privately-held companies may be
estimated based upon one or more of the following: pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information and current market rates; liquidation values; the values of recent rounds of
financing; and quoted market prices of comparable public companies.

Losses on Investments

HP monitors its investment portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the
decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis for the investment is established. In order to determine
whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary, HP evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the carrying value;
the financial condition of and business outlook for the company, including key operational and cash flow metrics, current market conditions and future trends in the company's industry; the company's
relative competitive position within the industry; and HP's intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.

The
declines in value of certain investments were determined to be other-than-temporary. Accordingly, HP recorded impairments of approximately $26 million
in fiscal 2004, $72 million in fiscal 2003 and $106 million in fiscal 2002. These impairments are included in Gains (losses) on investments and early extinguishment of debt in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Depending on market conditions, HP may record additional impairments on its investment portfolio in the future.


Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject HP to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash, investments, accounts receivable,
financing receivables and derivatives.

HP
maintains cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These
financial institutions are located in many different geographical regions, and HP's policy is designed to limit exposure with any one institution. As part of its cash and risk management processes, HP
performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions. HP has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. HP utilizes
forward contracts and other derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty,
which could result in a material loss.

HP
sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant receivable balances with these parties.
If the financial condition or operations of these distributors and resellers deteriorate substantially, HP's operating results could be adversely affected. The ten largest distributor and reseller
receivable balances collectively, which were concentrated primarily in North America, represented approximately 23% of gross accounts receivable at October 31, 2004 and 21% at
October 31, 2003. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable and financing receivables is generally diversified
due to the large number of entities comprising HP's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographical regions. HP performs ongoing credit evaluations of the
financial condition of its third-party distributors, resellers and other customers and requires collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. HP generally has
experienced longer accounts receivable collection cycles in its emerging markets, in particular Asia Pacific and Latin America, when compared to its United States and European markets. In the event
that accounts receivable collection cycles in the emerging markets significantly deteriorate or one or more of HP's larger resellers in these regions fail, HP's operating results could be adversely
affected.

Stock-Based Compensation

HP applies the intrinsic-value-based method prescribed in Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,"
in accounting for employee stock-based compensation. Accordingly, HP generally recognizes compensation expense only when it grants options with a discounted exercise price. HP recognizes any resulting
compensation expense ratably over the associated service period, which is generally the option vesting term.

HP
has determined pro forma amounts as if the fair value method required by SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation," had been applied to its stock-based
compensation. See Note 13 for descriptions of HP's stock-based compensation plans. The fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights were estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model.


The

Foreign Currency Transactions

HP uses the U.S. dollar predominately as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are remeasured into U.S.
dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for inventory, property, plant and equipment, other assets and deferred revenue, which are remeasured at historical exchange
rates. Net revenue, cost of sales and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those net revenue, cost of sales and expenses related to the previously
noted balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in net earnings (loss). Certain foreign subsidiaries
designate the local currency as their functional currency and the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet dates are recorded as


translation
adjustments and included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans

HP has various defined benefit, defined contribution and other contributory and noncontributory retirement and post-retirement plans. HP amortizes
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service life of participants. The measurement date for all plans is September 30 for
fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2002, the measurement dates were October 31 for HP plans and September 30 for Compaq plans. See Note 15 for a full description of these
plans and the accounting and funding policies.

Recent Pronouncements

FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. 109-2, "Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American
Jobs Creation Act of 2004" ("FSP 109-2"), provides guidance under FASB Statement No. 109, "Accounting for Income Taxes," with respect to recording the potential impact of the
repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Act") on enterprises' income tax expense and deferred tax liability. The Jobs Act was enacted on October 22, 2004.
FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation
of foreign earnings for purposes of applying FASB Statement No. 109. HP has not yet completed evaluating the impact of the repatriation provisions. Accordingly, as provided for in FSP
109-2, HP has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act.

In
May 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. 106-2 ("FSP 106-2"), "Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003" (the "Medicare Act"). The Medicare Act was enacted December 8, 2003. FSP 106-2 supersedes FSP 106-1, "Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003," and provides authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy specified in
the Medicare Act. The Medicare Act provides for a federal subsidy equal to 28% of certain prescription drug claims for sponsors of retiree health care plans with drug benefits that are at least
actuarially equivalent to those to be offered under Medicare Part D, beginning in 2006. HP has concluded that the prescription drug benefits provided under its plans are at least actuarially
equivalent to the prescription drug benefits offered under Medicare Part D.

FSP
106-2 provides that: (1) the effect of the federal subsidy should be accounted for as an actuarial experience gain; (2) since the federal subsidy is exempt
from federal taxes, any plan-related temporary income tax difference should exclude the effect of the subsidy; and (3) the effective date of FSP 106-2 is the first
interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004, with early adoption encouraged.

In
the third quarter of fiscal 2004, HP adopted FSP 106-2 retroactive to December 2003, the date of the enactment of the Medicare Act. As the annual measurement date
for HP's U.S. postretirement benefit plans is September 30, HP's 2004 fiscal year expense is impacted by approximately 10 months. The expected subsidy reduced HP's accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation by approximately


$133
million, which HP recognized as a reduction in the unrecognized net actuarial loss. HP amortizes the unrecognized net actuarial loss over the average remaining service life of HP's employees
eligible for postretirement benefits. The adoption of FSP 106-2 also affects service and interest costs associated with the plans and reduced the net periodic postretirement cost by
approximately $10 million in fiscal 2004. The expense amounts shown in Note 15 reflect the effects of the early adoption of FSP 106-2. HP may adjust these amounts in the
future, as detailed regulations necessary to implement the Medicare Act have not been issued.

The
adoption of the following recent accounting pronouncements did not have a material impact on HP's results of operations and financial condition:

•

FASB
Interpretation No. 45 ("FIN 45"), "Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of
Others—An Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34";

•

FASB
Interpretation No. 46(R) ("FIN 46R"), "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities—An Interpretation of ARB No. 51";

•

FASB
issued revised SFAS No. 132 (R) (revised 2003), "Employer's Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-Retirement Benefits—An
Amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106";

•

EITF
Issue No. 03-1, "The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments"; and

•

EITF
Issue No. 03-5, "Applicability of AICPA Statement of Position 97-2 to Non-Software Deliverables in an Arrangement Containing
More-Than-Incidental Software."

In
November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, "Inventory Costs—An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4" ("SFAS 151"). SFAS 151 amends the
guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, "Inventory Pricing," to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage).
Among other provisions, the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be recognized as current-period charges regardless of
whether they meet the criterion of "so abnormal" as stated in ARB No. 43. Additionally, SFAS 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be
based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by HP in the first quarter
of fiscal 2006, beginning on November 1, 2005. HP is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial
condition but does not expect SFAS 151 to have a material impact.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), which replaces SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation," ("SFAS 123") and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." SFAS 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including
grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005, with early
adoption encouraged. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 no longer will be an alternative to financial statement recognition. HP is required to adopt SFAS 123R
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, beginning August 1, 2005. Under SFAS 123R, HP must


determine
the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of adoption. The
transition methods include prospective and retroactive adoption options. Under the retroactive option, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption or for all
periods presented. The prospective method requires that compensation expense be recorded for all unvested stock options and restricted stock at the beginning of the first quarter of adoption of
SFAS 123R, while the retroactive methods would record compensation expense for all unvested stock options and restricted stock beginning with the first period restated. HP is evaluating the
requirements of SFAS 123R and expects that the adoption of SFAS 123R will have a material impact on HP's consolidated results of operations and earnings per share. HP has not yet
determined the method of adoption or the effect of adopting SFAS 123R, and it has not determined whether the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma
disclosures under SFAS 123.

In
December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, "Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets—An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions"
("SFAS 153"). SFAS 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29,
"Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions," and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial
substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS 153 is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after June 15,
2005 and is required to be adopted by HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2006, beginning on November 1, 2005. HP is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have
on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition but does not expect it to have a material impact.

Note 2: Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share ("EPS")

HP's basic EPS is calculated using net earnings (loss) and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS includes the
effect from potential issuance of common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and the assumed conversion of convertible notes.


The
reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS calculations was as follows for the fiscal years ended October 31:

In

calculation of diluted EPS because the effect was antidilutive. Stock options are antidilutive when the exercise price of the options is greater than the average market price of the common shares for
the period or when the results from operations are a net loss. In addition, the assumed conversion of zero-coupon subordinated notes into approximately 8 million shares of HP stock
was excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS in fiscal 2003 and 2002 because the effect was antidilutive.

HP
entered into a six-year revolving agreement during the third quarter of fiscal 2004 to sell certain trade receivables without recourse. Sold receivables are collected by
the third party, with the sales of receivables limited only by the outstanding maximum balance of receivables not yet collected by the third party. Trade receivables of approximately
680 million euros were sold during the last half of fiscal 2004, primarily during the fourth quarter. The implementation of this program did not have a material impact on HP's outstanding
receivable balance as utilization of this program was limited to certain customer receivables that were already under an alternative prompt payment program. Fees associated with this program do not
differ materially from the cash discounts offered to these customers under the alternative prompt payment program.

Note 5: Acquisitions

Acquisitions have been recorded using the purchase method of accounting, and, accordingly, the results of operations are included in HP's consolidated results as
of the date of each acquisition. HP allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research and
development ("IPR&D"), based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to assets acquired is based on valuations
using management's estimates and assumptions. The goodwill recorded as a result of these acquisitions is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

Compaq

On May 3, 2002, HP acquired all of the outstanding stock of Compaq Computer Corporation ("Compaq"), a leading global provider of information technology
products, services and solutions, in exchange for 0.6325 shares of HP common stock for each outstanding share of Compaq common stock and the assumption of options to purchase Compaq common stock based
on the same ratio. In addition, HP assumed certain Compaq stock plans. The acquisition of Compaq has enhanced HP's competitive position in key industries, while strengthening its sales force and
relationships with strategic customer bases. The acquisition has enabled HP to focus on strategic product and customer bases, achieve significant cost synergies and economies of scale and improve the
results of its Enterprise Storage and Servers ("ESS") and Software businesses (formerly combined as the Enterprise Systems Group), Personal Systems Group ("PSG") and HP Services ("HPS") businesses.
Furthermore, these cost savings offer strategic benefits by reducing HP's cost structure in competitive businesses such as personal computers ("PCs"). The acquisition also has allowed the Imaging and
Printing Group ("IPG") to leverage the interrelationship between PC and printer sales and utilize Compaq's direct distribution capabilities. HP derived the exchange ratio in the acquisition from
estimates of future revenue and earnings of the combined company assuming completion of the acquisition, and from measuring the relative contributions of each of HP and Compaq to achieving these
forecasted results, in addition to measuring the relative ownership of the combined company implied by their contributions. This transaction resulted in the issuance of approximately
1.1 billion shares of HP common stock with a fair value of approximately $22.7 billion, the assumption of Compaq options to purchase approximately 200 million shares of HP common
stock with a Black-Scholes fair value of approximately $1.4 billion and estimated direct transaction costs of $79 million, for a total purchase price of $24.2 billion. The fair
value of HP common stock was derived using an average market price per share of HP common stock of $20.92, which was based on an average of the closing prices for a range of trading days around
September 3, 2001, the announcement date of the acquisition.


Of
the total purchase price for this acquisition, $14.5 billion was allocated to goodwill, $3.5 billion was allocated to amortizable purchased intangible assets and
$1.4 billion was allocated to intangible assets with an indefinite life. The purchase price also included $18.4 billion of additional assets and $14.3 billion of assumed
liabilities. HP is amortizing the purchased intangibles on a straight-line basis over weighted average estimated useful lives of approximately 9 years for customer contracts and
approximately 6 years for developed and core technology and patents. The intangible asset with an indefinite life is the Compaq trade name. This intangible asset will not be amortized because
it has an indefinite remaining useful life based on many factors and considerations, including the length of time that the Compaq name has been in use, the Compaq brand awareness and market position
and the plans for continued use of the Compaq brand within a portion of HP's overall product portfolio.

Of
the total purchase price, $735 million was allocated to IPR&D and was expensed in the third quarter of fiscal 2002. Projects that qualify as IPR&D represent those that have not
yet reached technological feasibility and for which no future alternative uses exist. Technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta-phase working prototype in which
there is no remaining risk relating to the development.

The
value assigned to IPR&D was determined by considering the importance of each project to the overall development plan, estimating costs to develop the purchased IPR&D into
commercially viable products, estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value. The revenue estimates used to value
the purchased IPR&D were based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors, expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by Compaq and
its competitors.

The
rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present values were based on Compaq's weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to
reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility, the percentage-of-completion of each project, anticipated
market acceptance and penetration, market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets. Based on these factors, discount rates that range from 25% - 42%
were deemed appropriate for valuing the IPR&D.

In
accordance with the terms of Compaq's equity-based plans, all of Compaq's outstanding options that were granted prior to September 1, 2001 vested upon Compaq stockholder
approval of the acquisition. The intrinsic value of unvested Compaq options of approximately $70 million as of May 3, 2002, which relates to options granted subsequent to
August 31, 2001, was allocated to deferred compensation in the purchase price allocation. HP amortizes the deferred compensation over the remaining vesting period of the options, which was
approximately 3.5 years at May 3, 2002.

Pro forma results

The following unaudited pro forma financial information presents the combined results of operations of HP and Compaq as if the acquisition had occurred as of the
beginning of the period presented. Due to different historical fiscal period ends for HP and Compaq, the results for the year ended October 31, 2002 combine the historical results of HP for the
year ended October 31, 2002 and the historical quarterly results of Compaq for the six months ended March 31, 2002 and for the period from May 3, 2002 (the acquisition date) to
October 31, 2002. An adjustment of $162 million was made


to
the combined results of operations, reflecting amortization of purchased intangible assets, net of tax, that would have been recorded if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the period
presented. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not intended to represent or be indicative of the consolidated results of operations or financial condition of HP that would have been
reported had the acquisition been completed as of the beginning of the period presented, and should not be taken as representative of the future consolidated results of operations or financial
condition of HP. Pro forma results were as follows for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002:

Synstar

In October 2004, HP acquired approximately 99.7% of the outstanding stock of UK-based Synstar plc ("Synstar"). The purchase price was approximately
$343 million, which included $298 million of cash paid as well as direct transaction costs and certain liabilities recorded in connection with the transaction. Synstar is a leading
independent provider of information technology ("IT") services across Europe. This acquisition is intended to strengthen further HP's offering primarily in the area of multi-technology support
services. HP recorded approximately $172 million of goodwill and $122 million of amortizable purchased intangible assets in connection with this acquisition. HP is amortizing the
purchased intangibles, principally customer contracts and relationships, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years.


Triaton

In April 2004, HP acquired all of the outstanding stock of Triaton GmbH (with subsidiaries in Singapore, China and Brazil), Triaton France SAS and Triaton
N.A, Inc. (USA) (collectively "Triaton"). The purchase price was approximately $464 million, which included $306 million of cash paid as well as direct transaction costs and
certain liabilities recorded in connection with the transaction. Triaton is one of Germany's largest independent IT service providers. This acquisition is intended to increase HP's capacity to deliver
its Adaptive Enterprise offerings, with customers benefiting from added managed services, technology services (formerly called customer support) and consulting and integration capabilities. HP
recorded approximately $285 million of goodwill and $179 million of amortizable purchased intangible assets in connection with this acquisition. HP is amortizing the purchased
intangibles, principally customer contracts and relationships, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from two to eight years.

Digital GlobalSoft Limited

In fiscal 2004, HP paid approximately $315 million in cash for additional shares of Digital GlobalSoft Limited, a consolidated subsidiary of HP ("DGS"), to
increase HP's ownership from 50.1% to approximately 97.2%. DGS is a globally-focused software development and IT services company. This subsidiary has enhanced HP's capability in IT services,
including expertise in life cycle services such as migration, technical and application services. HP recorded approximately $281 million of goodwill in connection with this acquisition.

Intria-HP

In November 2002, HP acquired the remaining outstanding stock of Intria Corporation ("Intria"), in which HP held a 49% equity interest at October 31, 2002,
and other related IT assets from Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ("CIBC"), for approximately $100 million in cash. Intria is a provider of managed services, which HP jointly owned with CIBC.
In connection with the acquisition, HP also entered into a multi-year contract to provide managed services to CIBC. This acquisition and the outsourcing relationship with CIBC have added
depth and capability to HPS, including expertise in managing complex, heterogeneous IT operating environments for customers in the financial services industry and others that demand high availability
computing solutions. HP recorded approximately $27 million of goodwill and $33 million of amortizable purchased intangible assets in connection with the acquisition. HP is amortizing the
purchased intangible assets, consisting mainly of customer contracts, over their estimated weighted-average useful lives ranging from three to ten years.

Indigo

In March 2002, HP acquired substantially all of the outstanding stock of Indigo N.V. ("Indigo"), not previously owned by HP in exchange for HP common stock and
non-transferable contingent value rights ("CVRs") and the assumption of options to purchase Indigo common stock. This acquisition has strengthened HP's printer offerings by adding high
performance digital color printing systems. The total purchase price for Indigo was approximately $719 million, which included the fair value of HP common stock issued and options assumed to
purchase HP stock, as well as direct transaction costs and the cost of an equity investment made by HP in Indigo in October 2000. HP issued approximately 32 million shares of HP common
stock, and a consolidated subsidiary of HP issued approximately 53 million


CVRs,
which HP guaranteed, in connection with this transaction. HP recorded approximately $499 million of goodwill and $153 million of amortizable purchased intangible assets in
conjunction with the acquisition and the previous equity investment. HP is amortizing the purchased intangible assets over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to eight years. In addition,
HP recorded a pre-tax charge of approximately $58 million for IPR&D at the completion of the acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no future
alternative uses existed.

The
CVRs issued in conjunction with this acquisition entitle each holder to a one-time contingent cash payment of up to $4.50 per CVR, based on the achievement of certain
cumulative revenue results over a three-year period. Any liability related to the CVRs will be recorded as additional goodwill as payout thresholds are achieved. The future cash
pay-out, if any, of the CVRs will be payable after a three-year period that began on April 1, 2002 and could result in a maximum obligation of $237 million. HP
has not incurred a liability associated with the CVRs as of October 31, 2004.

Liquidity Management Corporation

At October 31, 2001, HP held a 49.5% equity interest in Liquidity Management Corporation ("LMC"), a non-strategic investment company, which HP
accounted for under the equity method of accounting. A third party investor held the remaining 50.5% of equity interest. On November 1, 2001, LMC redeemed the outstanding equity of the third
party investor, leaving HP as the sole stockholder of LMC. Accordingly, effective November 1, 2001, HP has included the assets, liabilities and results of operations of LMC in its Consolidated
Financial Statements. At November 1, 2001, the assets of LMC consisted primarily of $879 million of cash and cash equivalents.

Other Acquisitions

HP also acquired other companies during fiscal 2004 and 2003 that were not significant to its financial position or results of operations. Total consideration for
these acquisitions was approximately $250 million and $85 million in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. HP recorded approximately $181 million of goodwill and $49 million
of purchased intangibles in fiscal 2004 and $64 million of goodwill and $20 million of purchased intangibles in fiscal 2003 in connection with these other acquisitions. HP also recorded
approximately $37 million and $1 million of IPR&D related to these acquisitions in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively.

HP
has included the results of operations of all acquisitions prospectively from the respective dates of the transactions. Except for the Compaq acquisition, HP has not presented the pro
forma results of operations of the acquired businesses because the results are not material to HP's consolidated results of operations individually or in the aggregate.

Acquisition-Related Charges

Acquisition-related charges of approximately $54 million in fiscal 2004 consisted of deferred compensation, merger-related inventory adjustments and
professional fees, while the charges of approximately $280 million in fiscal 2003 and $701 million in fiscal 2002 were attributable primarily to costs incurred for employee retention
bonuses in connection with the Compaq acquisition as well as professional fees and consulting services. In addition, acquisition-related charges in fiscal 2002 included costs incurred for proxy
solicitation and advertising related to the Compaq acquisition.

The
goodwill reallocation shown in the table above relates to the reorganization of HP's business segments discussed in Note 18. The goodwill formerly included in the Enterprise
Systems Group was allocated between ESS and Software based on a relative fair value approach.

The
goodwill adjustment shown in the table above relates primarily to revisions of acquisition-related tax estimates, that resulted in additions to goodwill, offset partially by the
reduction of a restructuring liability and asset impairments associated with the fiscal 2002 and 2001 pre-acquisition Compaq restructuring plans. The reduction of the restructuring
liability and asset impairments adjusted original estimates to actual costs incurred at various locations throughout the world.

On
November 1, 2002, HP adopted SFAS No. 142, which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized and instead be tested for impairment on a periodic basis.

Based
on the results of its annual impairment tests, HP determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of August 1, 2004 or August 1, 2003. However, future goodwill
impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. HP will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter, and whenever events and changes in
circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment.

If
the provisions of SFAS No. 142 had been in effect for all periods presented, HP's net earnings (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share would have been unchanged for fiscal
2004 and 2003. For fiscal 2002, the net loss, basic net loss per share and diluted net loss per share would have been $796 million, $0.32 and $0.32, respectively, which represents an
improvement on reported net loss, basic net loss per share and diluted net loss per share of $107 million, $0.04 and $0.04, respectively.

HP
performs an annual impairment test for its purchased intangible asset with an indefinite life, the Compaq trade name. Based on the results of its annual impairment tests, HP
determined that no impairment of the Compaq trade name existed as of August 1, 2004 or August 1, 2003. However, future impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. HP will
continue to evaluate the purchased intangible asset with an indefinite life on an annual basis as of the beginning of the fourth quarter, and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that
there may be a potential impairment.

The
finite-lived purchased intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer lists and distribution agreements, which have weighted average useful lives of approximately eight
years, and developed and core technology, patents and product trademarks, which have weighted average useful lives of approximately six years.

Note 7: Restructuring Charges

Fiscal 2003 Restructuring Plans

In the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2003, HP's management approved and implemented plans to restructure certain of its operations. These plans were
entered into with the intent of better managing HP's cost structure and aligning certain of its operations more effectively with current businesses conditions. The initial charge for these actions
totaled $752 million and included costs of $639 million relating to severance and other employee benefits for workforce reductions, costs of $42 million for vacating duplicative
facilities (leased or owned) and contract termination costs, as well as asset impairments of $71 million associated with the identification of duplicative assets and facilities (leased or
owned) relating to the acquisition of Compaq. During fiscal 2004, HP recorded $37 million of additional charges under the 2003 restructuring plans which represented changes in original
estimates as well as new charges that did not meet the recognition criteria during fiscal 2003 and accordingly were charged to expense as incurred in fiscal 2004. Certain adjustments to the original
estimates for each operating segment were reflected in the total of costs incurred and expected. The adjustments had the effect of decreasing the estimated costs to be incurred for the PSG segment by
approximately $48 million and increasing the estimated costs to be incurred for the remaining segments by approximately $54 million.

Original
estimates of 2,300, 4,700 and 2,000 employees across many regions and job classes were included in the second third and fourth quarter workforce reduction plans, respectively,
for a total of 9,000 employees. As of October 31, 2004, approximately 8,300 of these employees had been terminated, placed in the workforce reduction programs or had retired. They consisted of
substantially all of the employees included in the second and third quarter actions and a majority of the employees in the fourth quarter action. An additional 300 employees under the fourth quarter
action are expected to leave during fiscal 2005, bringing the total estimated number of employees affected under the 2003
plans to 8,600, a reduction of 400 employees from the original estimate. HP expects to pay out the majority of the remaining costs relating to severance and other employee benefits in connection with
the remainder of the fourth quarter action during fiscal 2005. Some minor remaining severance and other employee benefits are expected to be paid out under phased retirement plans required in certain
international locations by the end of fiscal 2010. HP anticipates the remaining costs of vacating duplicative facilities and contract terminations associated with the second and fourth quarter actions
to be substantially settled by the end of fiscal 2005. In addition, approximately $6 million of costs related to the 2003 plans have not yet been accrued and will be charged to operations as
the restructuring activities occur during fiscal 2005.

Fiscal 2002 Restructuring Plans

In fiscal 2002, HP's management initiated and approved plans to restructure the operations of both the pre-acquisition HP and
pre-acquisition Compaq organizations. Consequently, HP recorded approximately $1.8 billion of costs associated with exiting the activities of pre-acquisition HP such as
severance, early retirement and other employee benefits, costs of vacating duplicative facilities (leased or owned), contract termination costs, asset impairment charges and other costs associated
with exiting activities of HP. These costs were included as a charge to the results of operations for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002. In addition, HP recorded approximately
$960 million of similar charges in connection with restructuring the pre-acquisition Compaq organization. HP recognized these costs as a liability assumed in the purchase and were
included in the allocation of the cost to acquire Compaq. In fiscal 2004 and 2003, HP recorded $75 million and $48 million, respectively of additional costs, net of


reductions,
in estimated severance and other employee benefits, as well as asset impairment and other restructuring costs related to the fiscal 2002 restructuring plans. Additionally, in fiscal 2004
and 2003, HP recorded adjustments to reduce goodwill of $71 million and $94 million, respectively. These adjustments related to true-ups to the fiscal pre-merger
Compaq 2002 restructuring plan. These fiscal 2004 and 2003 adjustments included changes to asset impairments for buildings vacated as part of the acquisition and adjustments to restructuring
liabilities for changes in severance estimates and contract termination costs.

The
severance, early retirement costs and other employee benefits related to the termination or planned early retirement of an originally estimated 17,900 employees worldwide across many
regions, business functions and job classes. As of October 31, 2004, approximately 17,600 employees included in the workforce reduction program had been terminated or had retired, a reduction
of 300 employees from the original estimate. HP expects to pay the majority of the remaining balance of the severance costs by the end of fiscal 2005. HP anticipates paying the remaining balance of
the costs for the other related restructuring activities, which consist primarily of contractual obligations such as facility leases, over the lives of the related obligations, which extend to the end
of fiscal 2010.

Fiscal 2001 Restructuring Plans

In fiscal 2001, HP's management approved restructuring actions to respond to the global economic downturn and to improve HP's cost structure by streamlining
operations and prioritizing resources in strategic areas of HP's business infrastructure. HP recorded a restructuring charge of $384 million in fiscal 2001 to reflect these actions which
consisted primarily of severance and other employee benefits related to termination of 7,500 employees worldwide. During fiscal 2002, HP recorded $21 million of additional charges to reflect
adjustments to the expected severance cost of its fiscal 2001 plan. As of the end of fiscal 2003, HP had terminated substantially all of these employees were terminated and paid substantially all
accrued costs.

As
part of the acquisition of Compaq, HP assumed the remaining obligations of Compaq's existing restructuring plans of $259 million, which Compaq initially recorded in its 2001
fiscal year. In fiscal 2004 and 2003, HP recorded adjustments to decrease goodwill related to true-ups to these plans of $2 million and $26 million, respectively. The
remaining balance of the pre-merger Compaq fiscal 2001 plan consists primarily of severance and other employee benefits as well as other restructuring costs. HP expects to settle the
majority of the remaining balance of the severance accrual under phased retirement plans required in certain international locations by the end of fiscal 2009. HP anticipates paying the other related
restructuring activities, which consist primarily of contractual obligations such as facility leases, over the lives of the related obligations, which extend to the end of fiscal 2010.

debt securities consist primarily of collateralized notes with banks and corporate debt securities. Equity securities in public companies are primarily common stock.

HP
estimated the fair values based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. These estimated fair values may not be representative of actual values of the
financial instruments that could have been realized as of year-end or that will be realized in the future.

In
May 2003, HP sold an investment in a debt security with a net book value of $65 million classified as a held-to-maturity security. The proceeds
of this sale were used for operating purposes. As the book value of the debt security approximated the market value on the date of sale, the realized loss associated with this sale was not material.
As a result of this transaction, HP reclassified all held-to-maturity securities, composed of approximately $200 million in time deposits, into available-for-sale securities. The book value of
these securities approximated the estimated fair value and the net unrealized loss, which was not material, was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of
stockholders' equity.

The
gross unrealized losses as of October 31, 2004 and 2003 were associated with investments in public equity securities with a fair value of $9 million and
$1 million, respectively, and have been in a continuous loss position for less than 12 months.

Derivative Financial Instruments

HP is a global company that is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of its business. As part of
its risk management strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, including forward contracts, swaps and options to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. HP's objective is to offset
gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them, respectively, thereby reducing
volatility of earnings or protecting fair values of assets and liabilities. HP does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. HP applies hedge accounting based upon the criteria
established by SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," whereby HP designates its derivatives as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment
hedges.

Fair Value Hedges

HP enters into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure of its debt and investment portfolios to both interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.
HP issues long-term debt in either U.S.


dollars
or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. HP then typically uses interest rate swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve
primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense and to manage exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for
floating interest payment obligations and, when the underlying debt is denominated in a foreign currency, exchange of the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-
denominated amounts. Alternatively, HP may choose not to swap fixed debt to a floating rate or may terminate a previously executed swap if the fixed rate positions provide a more beneficial
relationship between assets and liabilities. Similarly, HP may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with its foreign currency-denominated debt if this debt acts as a natural
foreign currency hedge for assets denominated in the same currency. In order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, HP periodically may enter into interest rate swaps
that convert fixed interest returns into variable interest returns. As of October 31, 2004, HP had a total notional amount of approximately $6 billion in fair value hedges. For
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, HP recognizes the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item, in
earnings in the current period. In September 2002, HP terminated an interest rate swap that effectively converted fixed rate interest to variable rate interest on debt that matures in 2005. The
deferred gain of $185 million on this termination is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining life of the underlying debt. During fiscal 2004 and 2003, HP's
interest rate swap terminations were not material.

Cash Flow Hedges

HP uses cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based interest income received on certain variable-rate investments. HP enters into
interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns. As of October 31, 2004, HP had a total notional amount of $250 million in
interest rate swaps classified as cash flow hedges. For interest rate
swaps that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, changes in the fair values are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity and
subsequently are reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings.

HP
uses a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue
and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. HP's foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within six months. However, certain leasing
revenue-related forward contracts extend for the duration of the lease term, which can be up to five years. As of October 31, 2004, HP had a total notional amount of $4.9 billion of
forwards and options. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, HP initially records the effective portions of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in
accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is
recognized in earnings. HP reports the ineffective portion of the gain or loss, if any, in other income or expense immediately. HP reports the effective portion of cash flow hedges in the same
financial statement line item as the changes in value of the hedged item. As of October 31, 2004, HP expects $98 million of derivative losses included in accumulated other comprehensive
income to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.


Net Investment Hedges

HP uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local
currency. As of October 31, 2004, HP had a total notional amount of $750 million in forward contracts. For derivative instruments that are designated as net investment hedges, HP records
the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of stockholders' equity. The loss on net investment hedges included
in cumulative translation adjustment was $43 million and $18 million in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. HP reports the effective portion of net
investment hedges in the same financial statement line item as the changes in value of the hedged item.

Other Derivatives

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133 consist primarily of forward contracts used to hedge foreign currency balance
sheet exposures and warrants in companies invested in as part of strategic relationships. As of October 31, 2004, HP had a total notional amount of $14 billion in other derivatives not
designated as hedging instruments. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133, HP recognizes changes in the fair values in earnings in the period of
change. HP recognizes the gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge balance sheet exposures in interest and other, net in the same period as the remeasurement gain and loss
of the related foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and thus naturally offsets these gains and losses. HP recognized net foreign currency exchange losses of approximately
$142 million in fiscal 2004, $125 million in fiscal 2003 and $165 million in fiscal 2002 which related primarily to forward points in its hedging contracts.

Hedge Effectiveness

For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged debt or investment with
the change in fair value of the derivative. For interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, HP measures the hedging effectiveness by offsetting the change in the variable portion of the
interest rate swaps with the changes in expected interest income received due to the fluctuations in the LIBOR based interest rate. For foreign currency option and forward contracts designated as cash
flow or net investment hedges, HP measures hedge effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the hedged item, both of which are based on
forward rates. Any ineffective portion of the hedge, as well as amounts not included in the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in interest and other, net. As of October 31, 2004, the
portion of hedging instruments' gains or losses excluded from the assessment of effectiveness was not material for fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Hedge ineffectiveness for fair value,
cash flow and net investment hedges was not material in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. As of October 31, 2004, amounts related to derivatives qualifying as cash
flow hedges amounted to a reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income of $115 million, net of tax, of which $98 million was expected to be transferred to earnings in the next
12 months along with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions. In addition, during fiscal 2004 and 2003 HP did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for which it was probable
that a forecasted transaction would not occur.


HP
estimates the fair values of derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The
fair market
value of derivative financial instruments and the respective SFAS No. 133 classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheets was as follows at October 31:

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments

For certain of HP's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, financing receivables,
notes payable and short-term borrowings, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The estimated fair value
of HP's short-and long-term debt was approximately $6.9 billion at October 31, 2004, compared to a carrying value of $7.1 billion at that date. The estimated fair
value of the debt is based primarily on quoted market prices, as well as borrowing rates currently available to HP for bank loans with similar terms and maturities.

Note 9: Financing Receivables and Operating Leases

Financing receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases resulting from the marketing of HP's and complementary third-party products.
These receivables typically have terms from two to five years and are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from
operating leases. The components of net financing


receivables,

Note 10: Guarantees

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any
losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or
claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.

Warranty

HP provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. HP engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers; however, product warranty terms offered to


customers,
ongoing product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure, as well as specific product class failures outside of HP's baseline
experience, affect the estimated warranty obligation. If actual product failure rates, material usage or service delivery costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability
would be required.

Deferred support contract services revenue represents amounts received or billed in advance primarily for fixed-price support or maintenance contracts. These services
include stand-alone product support packages, routine maintenance service contracts, upgrades or extensions to standard product warranty, as well as high availability services for complex, global,
networked, multi-vendor environments. These service amounts are deferred at the time the customer is billed and then recognized ratably over the contract life or as the services are rendered.

Other
deferred revenue represents amounts received or billed in advance for contracts related primarily to consulting and integration projects, managed services start-up or transition
work, as well as minor amounts for training, and product sales. HP recognizes the majority of these amounts as revenue based on the proportional performance method.

HP
may redeem some or all of the Global Notes, Medium Term Notes, Series A Medium Term Notes and the Euro Medium-Term Notes (collectively, the
"Notes"), as set forth in the above table, at any time at the redemption prices described in the prospectus supplements relating thereto. The Notes are senior unsecured debt.

The
LYONs are convertible by the holders at an adjusted rate of 15.09 shares of HP common stock for each $1,000 face value of the LYONs, payable in either cash or common stock at HP's
election. At any time, HP may redeem the LYONs at book value, payable in cash only. In December 2000, the Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for the LYONs that allowed HP to
repurchase the LYONs from time to time at varying prices. In fiscal 2002, HP repurchased $257 million in face value of the LYONs with a book value of $158 million for an aggregate
purchase price of $127 million, resulting in a gain of $31 million. The gain is included in Gains (losses) on investments and early extinguishment of debt in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations. HP did not repurchase any LYONs in fiscal 2004 or 2003.

HP
established a $4.0 billion U.S. commercial paper program in December 2000. Hewlett-Packard International Bank PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HP, established a
$500 million Euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit Programme in May 2001.

HP's
$1.7 billion 364-day credit facility expiring in March 2004 and $1.3 billion three-year credit facility expiring in March 2005
were replaced with a $1.5 billion 364-day credit facility and a $1.5 billion five-year credit facility, respectively, in March 2004 (together, the "Credit
Facilities"). Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the Credit Facilities vary, as applicable, based on HP's external credit ratings. The Credit Facilities, which are subject to weighted
average commitment fees of eight basis points per annum on the unused portion, are senior unsecured committed borrowing arrangements and available for general corporate purposes, including
supporting the issuance of commercial paper.

HP
also maintains, through various foreign subsidiaries, lines of credit from a number of financial institutions.

HP
registered the sale of up to $3.0 billion of debt or global securities ("Global Notes"), common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants under a shelf
registration statement in March 2002 (the "2002 Shelf Registration Statement"). In December 2002, HP filed a supplement to the 2002 Shelf Registration Statement, which allows HP to offer
from time to time up to $1.5 billion of Medium-Term Notes, Series B, due nine months or more from the date of issuance (the "Series B Medium-Term Note
Program"). HP may redeem any Series B Medium-Term Notes at any time at the redemption prices described in the prospectus supplements relating thereto. As of October 31, 2004,
HP has not issued Medium-Term Notes pursuant to the Series B Medium-Term Note Program.

HP
registered the sale of up to $3.0 billion of Medium-Term Notes under its Euro Medium-Term Note Programme filed with the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and
has offered such notes as set forth in the table above. HP can denominate these notes in any currency including the Euro. However, these notes have not been and will not be registered in the United
States.

At
October 31, 2004, HP has available borrowing resources of up to $12.7 billion under the 2002 registration statement, credit facilities and other programs described
above.

At
October 31, 2004, HP had a deferred tax asset of $403 million in loss carryforwards, of which $398 million relates to foreign net operating losses. HP has
provided a valuation allowance of $321 million on those foreign net operating loss carryforwards which are not likely to be utilized. Of the total tax credit carryforwards of
$678 million, HP had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $391 million, which do not expire, and research and development credit carryforwards of $83 million, which
will expire in fiscal 2023 and 2024. HP also had tax credits of $204 million in foreign countries, on which HP has provided a valuation allowance of $29 million.

Gross
deferred tax assets at October 31, 2004 and 2003 were reduced by valuation allowances of $447 million and $400 million, respectively. At October 31,
2004, in addition to $350 million of valuation allowances on foreign net operating losses and tax credits, HP had valuation allowances of $92 million and $5 million on unrealized
capital losses and other items, respectively. Of the $447 million in valuation allowances at October 31, 2004, $139 million was related to certain Compaq deferred tax assets
existing at the time of the acquisition. In the future, if we determine that the realization of these Compaq deferred tax assets is more likely than not, the reversal of the related valuation
allowance will reduce goodwill instead of the provision for taxes.

Of
the total tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs, the amounts booked to stockholders' equity were approximately
$35 million in fiscal 2004, $24 million in fiscal 2003 and $21 million in fiscal 2002.

In
fiscal 2004, the tax rate benefited from net favorable adjustments to previously estimated tax liabilities of $207 million, which decreased the provision for taxes by
approximately $0.07 per share. Excluding these adjustments, our tax rate for the year would have been 21.6%. The most significant favorable adjustments related to the resolution of a California state
tax audit, a net favorable revision to estimated tax accruals upon filing the 2003 U.S. income tax return, and a reduction in taxes on foreign earnings due to a change in regulatory policy. These
favorable adjustments were offset in part by the net effect of smaller adjustments to income tax liabilities in various jurisdictions.

As
a result of certain employment actions and capital investments undertaken by HP, income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some
cases is wholly exempt from taxes, through fiscal 2018. The gross income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be approximately $947 million
($0.31 per share) in fiscal 2004, $705 million ($0.23 per share) in fiscal 2003 and $473 million ($0.19 per share) in fiscal 2002. The gross income tax benefits were
offset partially by accruals of U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings, among other factors.

The
Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") has completed its examination of the income tax returns of HP for all years through 1998 and of Compaq for all years through 1997. HP's tax years
from 1993 through 1998 are currently before the IRS's Appeals Division. As of October 31, 2004, the IRS was in the process of examining HP's income tax returns for years 1999 through 2003 and
Compaq's income tax returns for years 1998 through 2002. In addition, HP is subject to numerous ongoing audits by state


and
foreign tax authorities. HP believes that adequate accruals for HP and Compaq have been provided for all years.

HP
has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $15.0 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of October 31,
2004 because such earnings are intended to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the United States. Where excess cash has accumulated in HP's non-U.S. subsidiaries and it is advantageous
for business operations, tax or cash reasons, subsidiary earnings are remitted. If these earnings were distributed, foreign tax credits may become available under current law to reduce or eliminate
the resulting U.S. income tax liability. HP has not reevaluated its position with respect to the indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings to take into account the possible election of the
repatriation provisions contained in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The status of HP's evaluation of these provisions is described in the following section.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004—Repatriation of Foreign Earnings

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the "Jobs Act"), enacted on October 22, 2004, provides for a temporary 85% dividends received deduction on certain
foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period. The deduction would result in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings. To qualify for the deduction, the
earnings must be reinvested in the United States pursuant to a domestic reinvestment plan established by a company's chief executive officer and approved by the company's board of directors. Certain
other criteria in the Jobs Act must be satisfied as well. The maximum amount of HP's foreign earnings that qualify for the temporary deduction is $14.5 billion. For HP, the one-year
period during which the qualifying distributions can be made is fiscal 2005.

HP
is in the process of evaluating whether it will repatriate foreign earnings under the repatriation provisions of the Jobs Act, and if so, the amount that will be repatriated. The
range of reasonably possible amounts that HP is considering for repatriation, which would be eligible for the temporary deduction, is zero to $14.5 billion. HP is awaiting the issuance of
further regulatory guidance and passage of statutory technical corrections with respect to certain provisions in the Jobs Act prior to determining the amounts it will repatriate. If such regulatory
guidance or technical corrections are favorable, HP is likely to repatriate amounts in the high end of its range. HP expects to determine the amounts and sources of foreign earnings to be repatriated,
if any, during the third quarter of fiscal 2005.

HP
is not yet in a position to determine the impact of a qualifying repatriation, should it choose to make one, on its income tax expense for fiscal 2005, the amount of its indefinitely
reinvested foreign earnings, or the amount of its deferred tax liability with respect to foreign earnings. If HP were to plan to repatriate the maximum amount eligible for the temporary deduction,
which is $14.5 billion, from foreign earnings which were previously indefinitely reinvested, HP estimates it would accrue additional tax expense in fiscal 2005 of between $850 million
and $925 million. The amount of additional tax expense accrued would be reduced if some part of the eligible dividend was attributable to foreign earnings on which a deferred tax liability had
been previously accrued (that is, on non-indefinitely reinvested earnings).


Note 13: Stockholders' Equity

Dividends

The stockholders of HP common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by HP's Board of Directors. Dividends are paid quarterly. Dividends
were $0.32 per common share in each of fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

HP sponsors the Hewlett-Packard Company 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, also known as the Share Ownership Plan (the "ESPP"), a non-compensatory
plan where eligible employees may contribute up to 10% of base compensation, subject to certain income limits, to purchase shares of HP's common stock. The stock is purchased semi-annually
at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value at certain plan-defined dates. At October 31, 2004, approximately 143,000 employees were eligible to participate, and approximately
62,000 employees were participants in the ESPP. In fiscal 2004, participants purchased 25,868,000 shares of HP common stock at a weighted-average price of $14 per share. In fiscal 2003, participants
purchased 23,884,000 shares of HP common stock at a weighted-average price of $14 per share. In fiscal 2002, participants purchased 18,536,000 shares of HP common stock at a weighted-average price of
$14 per share.

As
of October 31, 2000 employees no longer were permitted to make contributions to the Hewlett-Packard Company Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "Legacy ESPP"). At
October 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no remaining unvested shares in the Legacy ESPP. Compensation expense recognized under the Legacy ESPP was $29 million in fiscal 2002 for shares
that HP matched on employee stock purchases.

Incentive Compensation Plans

HP has stock option plans, including principal plans adopted in 2000, 1995 and 1990, as well as various stock option plans assumed through acquisitions, under
which stock options are outstanding. All regular employees were considered eligible to receive stock options in fiscal 2004. There were approximately 135,000 employees holding options under one or
more of the option plans as of October 31, 2004. HP adopted an additional principal plan in fiscal 2004, under which no stock options have been granted. The principal plans adopted in 2004,
2000, 1995 and 1990 permit options granted to qualify as "incentive stock options" under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The exercise price of a stock option generally is equal to the fair market
value of HP's common stock on the date the option is granted. The term of options granted in fiscal 2004 and 2003 was generally eight years, while options granted prior to fiscal 2003 generally had a
ten-year term. Under the 2000 Stock Plan and the 1990 and 1995 Incentive Stock Plans, HP may choose, in certain cases, to establish a discounted exercise price at no less than 75% of fair
market value on the grant date. HP did not grant any discounted options in fiscal 2004 and 2003. HP granted discounted options to purchase 679,000 shares in fiscal 2002. Options generally vest at a
rate of 25% per year over a period of four years from the date of grant, with the exception of discounted options. Discounted options generally may not be exercised until the third or fifth
anniversary of the option grant date, at which time such options become fully vested. The cost of the discounted options, determined to be the difference between the exercise price of the option and
the fair market value of HP's common stock on the date of the option grant, is expensed ratably over the option vesting period.

Under
the 2000 Stock Plan and the 1990 and 1995 Incentive Stock Plans, certain employees were granted cash, restricted stock awards, or both. Cash and restricted stock awards are
independent of option grants and are subject to restrictions. The majority of the shares of restricted stock outstanding at October 31, 2004 are subject to forfeiture if employment terminates
prior to the release of restrictions, generally one to three years from the date of grant. During that period, ownership of the shares cannot be transferred. Restricted stock has the same cash
dividend and voting rights as other common stock and is considered to be currently issued and outstanding. The cost of the awards, determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of
grant, is expensed ratably over the period the restrictions lapse. HP had 1,533,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding at October 31, 2004, 1,008,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding
at October 31, 2003 and 1,370,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding at October 31, 2002.


Compensation
expense recognized under incentive compensation plans was approximately $48 million in fiscal 2004, $45 million in fiscal 2003 and $84 million in fiscal
2002.

Shares Reserved

Shares available for the ESPP and incentive compensation plans were 257,554,000 at October 31, 2004, including 29,123,000 shares under the assumed Compaq
plans, and 168,951,000 at October 31, 2003, including 42,967,000 shares under the assumed Compaq plans.

HP
had 808,855,000 shares of common stock reserved at October 31, 2004 and 670,929,000 shares of common stock reserved at October 31, 2003 for future issuance under
stock-related benefit plans. Additionally, HP had 21,494,000 shares of common stock reserved at October 31, 2004 and 2003 for future issuances related to conversion of zero-coupon
subordinated notes.

Stock Repurchase Program

HP repurchases shares of its common stock under a systematic program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans and also to return
cash to HP's stockholders. This program authorizes purchases in the open market or in private transactions. During fiscal year 2004 HP's Board of Directors authorized $5.0 billion for future
repurchases of outstanding common stock, including authorization to repurchase $3.0 billion of HP shares during the fourth quarter. HP completed
share repurchases of approximately 172 million shares for $3.3 billion, 40 million shares for $751 million and 40 million shares for $671 million in fiscal
2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Shares repurchased in fiscal 2004 included open market repurchases of 66 million shares for $1.3 billion, 72 million shares for
$1.3 billion under an accelerated share repurchase program with an investment bank (the "Accelerated Purchase") and 34 million shares for $679 million from the David and Lucile
Packard Foundation (the "Packard Foundation"). Shares repurchased from the Packard Foundation in fiscal years 2003 and 2002 were 13 million shares and 3 million shares for
$241 million and $31 million, respectively.

The
Accelerated Purchase occurred on September 20, 2004 and was completed in November 2004, the first quarter of fiscal 2005. Upon completion of the program HP paid a
$51 million price adjustment based on the difference between the $18.82 weighted average price of the open market stock purchases by the investment bank and the initial purchase price of $18.11
per share. The price adjustment also included certain amounts reflecting the investment bank's carrying costs or benefits from purchasing shares at prices other than the initial price and its benefits
from receiving the $1.3 billion payment in advance of its purchases. The Accelerated Purchase was accounted for as an equity transaction on the cash settlement dates.

Shares
repurchased from the Packard Foundation are purchased under the terms of a memorandum of understanding dated September 9, 2002 and amended and restated September 17,
2004 that, among other things, prices the repurchases by reference to the volume weighted-average price for composite New York Stock Exchange transactions on trading days in which a repurchase occurs.
Either HP or the Packard Foundation may suspend or terminate sales under the amended and restated memorandum of understanding at any time.

As
of October 31, 2004, HP had authorization for remaining future repurchases of approximately $2.9 billion.

Note 15: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Substantially all of HP's employees are covered under various defined benefit plans, defined contribution plans, or both, when they have met the eligibility
requirements. In addition, HP sponsors medical and life insurance plans that provide benefits to retired U.S. employees who meet eligibility requirements.


Defined Benefit Plans

HP sponsors a number of defined benefit plans worldwide, of which the most significant are in the United States. For U.S employees hired or rehired on or after
January 1, 2003, HP sponsors the Hewlett-Packard Company Cash Account Pension Plan (the "Cash Account Pension Plan"), a defined benefit plan under which benefits accrue pursuant to a cash
accumulation account formula based upon a percentage of pay plus interest. The HP Retirement Plan (the "Retirement Plan") is a defined benefit pension plan for U.S. employees hired on or before
December 31, 2002. Benefits under the Retirement Plan generally are based on pay and years of service, except for eligible pre-acquisition Compaq employees, who do not receive
credit for years of service prior to January 1, 2003.

The
benefit payable to a U.S. employee under the Retirement Plan for service before 1993, if any, is reduced by any amounts due to the employee under HP's frozen defined contribution
Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("the DPSP"). The DPSP was closed to new participants in 1993. The DPSP plan obligations are equal to the plan assets and are recognized as an offset to the Retirement
Plan when
HP calculates its defined benefit pension cost and obligations. The fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit plans combined with the DPSP as of the
September 30 measurement date is as follows:

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

U.S. employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2003 may be eligible to participate in a post-retirement medical plan, the HP Retiree
Medical Program, but must bear the full cost of their participation. In addition, substantially all of HP's U.S. employees at December 31, 2002
could become eligible for retiree life insurance benefits and partially subsidized retiree medical benefits under the Pre-2003 HP Retiree Medical Program (the "Pre-2003 Program") and certain other
retiree medical programs. Plan participants in the Pre-2003 Program make contributions based on their choice of medical option and length of service.

The
Medicare Act reduced HP's post-retirement medical plan obligations and expense during fiscal 2004. See Note 1 for a full description of the impact of the Medicare
Act as adopted by HP in the third quarter of fiscal 2004, retroactive to December 2003, the date of the enactment of the Medicare Act.

Defined Contribution Plans

HP offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution expense was $405 million in fiscal
2004, $377 million in fiscal 2003 and $309 million in fiscal 2002. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Company 401(k) Plan


(the
"HP 401(k) Plan") when they meet eligibility requirements unless they decline participation. On May 3, 2002, HP assumed the sponsorship of the Compaq Computer Corporation 401(k) Investment
Plan (the "Compaq 401(k) Plan"). Effective January 1, 2004, the Compaq 401(k) Plan was merged into the HP 401(k) Plan.

U.S.
employees may contribute up to 50% of eligible compensation on a pre-tax basis, subject to certain limits. Prior to January 1, 2003, the maximum employee
contribution was 20% of eligible compensation. HP matches employee contributions with cash contributions up to a maximum of 4% of eligible compensation. During the last eight months of calendar
2002 for the Compaq 401(k) Plan only, HP matched up to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation.

Effective
January 31, 2004, the HP Stock Fund has been designated as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and, as a result, participants in the HP Stock Fund may receive dividends in
cash or may reinvest such dividends into the HP Stock Fund. HP paid approximately $13 million in dividends for the HP common shares held by the HP Stock Fund in fiscal 2004. The
dividends are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders' Equity. The HP Stock Fund held approximately 40 million shares of HP common stock at
October 31, 2004.

Investment Policy

HP's investment strategy for worldwide plan assets is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk. The majority of the plans'
investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset
classes and investment styles, and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans' investment managers are authorized to utilize derivatives for investment purposes, and
HP occasionally utilizes derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment exposures.

The
target asset allocation selected for each plan reflects a risk/return profile HP feels is appropriate relative to each plan's liability structure and return goals. HP regularly
conducts periodic asset-liability studies for U.S. plan assets in order to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plan's forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs. A portion
of the U.S. defined benefit plan assets and post-retirement benefit plan assets are invested in private market securities such as venture capital funds, private debt and private equity to
provide diversification and higher expected returns.


Outside
the U.S., local regulations require different approaches to target asset allocations, leaning toward a higher percentage allocation in fixed income securities. For each country
the local pension board decides on the target allocation. HP's corporate office plays an important governance role in periodically reviewing and approving the allocation strategy and providing a
recommended list of investment managers for each country plan.

Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term rate of return on assets for each U.S. plan reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests,
the weight of each asset class in the target mix, the correlations among asset classes, and their expected volatilities. Expected asset class returns reflected the current yield on U.S. government
bonds and risk premiums for each asset class. HP considered factors such as historical risk premiums and current valuations, dividend yields, inflation and expected earnings growth rates. Because HP's
investment policy is to employ primarily active
investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the asset class expected returns were adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns net of fees.

The
approach used to arrive at the expected rate of return on assets for the non-U.S. plans was to apply an asset allocation policy of each plan to the expected country real
returns for equity and fixed income investments. On an annual basis, empirical data is gathered from the local country subsidiaries to determine expected long-term rates of return for
equity and fixed income. These expected real rates of return are then weighted based on country specific allocation mixes adjusted for inflation.

Future Contributions and Funding Policy

HP expects to contribute approximately $850 million to its pension plans and $60 million to its post-retirement plans in fiscal 2005.
HP's funding policy is to contribute cash to its pension plans so that at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government and funding and taxing authorities, are met.
Contributions made to the post-retirement plans will be used primarily for the payment of retiree health claims incurred during the fiscal year.

Estimated Future Benefits Payable

HP estimates that the future benefits payable for the retirement and post-retirement plans in place are as follows at October 31, 2004:

Note 16: Commitments

HP leases certain real and personal property under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain leases require HP to pay property taxes, insurance and
routine maintenance, and include escalation clauses. Rent expense was approximately $766 million in fiscal 2004, $703 million in fiscal 2003 and $566 million in fiscal 2002.
Sublease rental income was approximately $43 million in fiscal 2004, $46 million in fiscal 2003 and $17 million in fiscal 2002.

Future
annual minimum lease payments and sublease rental income commitments, excluding future obligations included in the restructuring liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, at
October 31, 2004 are as follows:

At
October 31, 2004, HP had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $1.0 billion. These unconditional purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods
or services that are enforceable and legally binding on HP and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions;
and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. These unconditional purchase obligations are principally related to cost of
sales, inventory and other items.

Note 17: Litigation and Contingencies

Pending Litigation and Proceedings

Intergraph Hardware Technologies Company v. HP, Dell & Gateway

is a lawsuit filed in United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Marshall County, on December 16, 2002. Gateway and Dell are no longer defendants in this matter. The suit accuses HP of infringement of three
patents related to cache memory (the "Clipper Patents"). Intergraph Hardware Technologies Company ("Intergraph") seeks damages constituting a "reasonable royalty" (as well as enhanced damages), an
injunction, prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees. The complaint was served on HP on April 1, 2003. On May 21, 2003, HP answered and counterclaimed for a declaratory judgment
that the patents are not infringed by HP and that the patents are invalid and unenforceable. Fact discovery closed on October 27, 2004. A claim construction hearing was held on May 7,
2004 and the court issued a ruling on the claim construction hearing on July 1, 2004. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on February 7, 2005, and trial is scheduled to begin on
February 21, 2005. Expert discovery is ongoing. On May 7, 2004, Intergraph sued HP in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler County, for infringement of
another patent related to cache memory management. Intergraph seeks an injunction, declaratory relief and attorneys' fees, but not damages. HP answered and counterclaimed, asserting Intergraph's
infringement of two HP software patents. HP seeks damages and an injunction. Trial in that matter is scheduled to begin on April 11, 2005 for Intergraph's claims, and on October 24, 2005
for HP's claims. Intergraph has obtained significant settlements from other defendants, ranging from $10 million (Advanced Micro Devices) to $300 million (Intel Corporation), relating to such
defendants' direct use of the Clipper Patents. However, the ultimate resolution of these proceedings


and
the financial impact on HP, which will depend in part on determinations as to the useful life of the patents, what would constitute "reasonable royalty" rates, the allocation of any amounts paid
for accounting purposes, the timing of any payments and the units impacted, remains uncertain.

On
May 28, 2003, HP sued Intergraph Corporation, the parent of Intergraph, in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, San Francisco Division,
accusing Intergraph Corporation of infringement of four HP patents related to computer-aided design, video display technology and information retrieval technology. Intergraph answered and
counterclaimed for declaratory relief on October 14, 2003. A claim construction hearing was held on October 22, 2004, and the court subsequently issued its claim construction rulings. HP
expects trial to begin in mid-2005. HP seeks damages, an injunction, prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees. On April 1, 2004, HP
sued Intergraph Corporation in the Mannheim State Court in Mannheim, Germany, and related proceedings in Germany are pending, for infringement of two European Union patents related to computer-aided
design. HP seeks damages, an injunction and costs. Trial took place in November 2004, and the court subsequently dismissed HP's action based on a determination of Intergraph's noninfringement.
On April 19, 2004, HP sued Z/I Imaging, a subsidiary of Intergraph Corporation, and Intergraph Corporation, in United States District Court for the District of Delaware, accusing Z/I Imaging of
infringement of two patents related to image scanning technology. Intergraph answered and counterclaimed for declaratory relief on May 28, 2004. Trial is scheduled to begin December 4,
2005. Also on April 19, 2004, HP sued Intergraph Corporation in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas for infringement of one patent relating to computer-aided design.
Intergraph answered and counterclaimed for declaratory relief on May 13, 2004. Jury selection is expected to begin in December 2005. In both cases, HP seeks damages, an injunction,
prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees.

Copyright levies.

Proceedings are being pursued against HP in certain European Union ("EU") member
countries seeking to impose levies upon equipment (such as printers and multi-function devices) alleging that these devices enable producing private copies of copyrighted materials.

Two
non-binding arbitration proceedings instituted in June 2001 and June 2002, respectively, were brought in Germany before the arbitration board of the Patent
and Trademark Office. VerwertungsGesellschaft Wort ("VG Wort"), a collection agency representing certain copyright holders, brought the proceedings against HP, which relate to whether and to what
extent copyright levies should be imposed in accordance with copyright laws implemented in Germany relating to multi-function devices and printers that allegedly enable the production of copies by
private persons. The published tariffs on these devices in Germany range from 10 to 613.56 euros per unit. Non-binding proposals were presented in the proceedings, both of which HP
rejected. In May 2004, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court in Stuttgart, Germany seeking levies on multi-function devices ("MFDs"). A decision in this matter subsequently
was issued. The court held that HP is liable for payments regarding photocopiers sold in Germany, but did not determine the exact amount payable per unit. The court further stated that HP should
furnish information regarding the number of MFDs sold in Germany up to December 2001 and the number of copies per minute that various MFDs can produce. Finally, the court held that a levy of a
maximum of 1.5% of the price was due on the bundle "LJ8150 MFP plus Scanner-Module C4166B," and that the individual elements of this bundle were not part of the claim. The deadline for filing an
appeal of this decision is January 31, 2005. In July 2004, VG Wort filed a separate lawsuit against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court seeking levies on printers. A decision in this matter
was subsequently issued. The court held that HP is liable for payments regarding


all
printers using ASCII code sold in Germany, but did not determine the amount payable per unit. The court further stated that HP should furnish information regarding the number of printers sold in
Germany since April 2001 and the number of copies per minute that various printers can produce. The deadline for filing an appeal of this decision is January 27, 2005. In
September 2003, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against Fujitsu Siemens Computer GmbH ("FSC") in Munich State Court seeking levies on PCs. This is an industry test case in Germany, and HP has
undertaken to be bound by a final decision. A decision in this matter subsequently was issued stating that PCs are subject to a levy and that FSC should furnish information as to the number of PCs
sold in Germany since January 1, 2001. Further, FSC must pay 12 euros plus compound interest for each PC sold in Germany from March 24, 2001. FSC has indicated that it will appeal the
decision.

In
April 2001, the Organization for the Collective Management of Works of Literature, the Organization for the Collective Management of Works of Plastic Arts and their
Applications, and the Organization for the Collective Management and Protection of Intellectual Property of Photographers brought five proceedings against HP Hellas and Compaq Computer E.P.E. in
Greece relating to whether a levy of 2% should be payable upon computer products, including central processing units, monitors, keyboards, mice, diskettes, printers, scanners and related items in
accordance with Greek copyright law, before its amendment in September 2002. These proceedings are pending before the Court of First Instance of Athens or before the Court of Appeal of Athens.

In
April 1998, Auvibel s.c.r.l., a Belgian collection agency, filed an appeal of a judgment in HP's favor with the Court of Appeal in Brussels relating to a dispute as to whether
and to what extent copyright levies should be imposed upon CD-writers and CD media. The case has been removed from the court's list of pending cases, without prejudice to the parties'
right to reinstate the matter.

The
total levies due, if imposed, would be based upon the number of products sold, and the per-product amounts of the levies, which will vary. Some EU member countries that
do not yet have levies on digital devices are expected to implement similar legislation to enable them to extend existing levy schemes, while some other EU member countries are expected to limit the
scope of levy schemes and applicability in the digital hardware environment. HP, other companies and various industry associations are opposing the extension of levies to the digital environment and
advocating compensation to rights holders through digital rights management systems. Based on such opposition, HP's assessments of the merits of various proceedings and HP's estimates of the units
impacted and levies, HP has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the matters described above. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters, including the number of units
impacted, the amount of levies imposed in various jurisdictions and the availability of HP to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.

Alvis v. HP

is a nationwide defective product consumer class action that was filed in state court in
Jefferson County, Texas by a resident of Eastern Texas in April 2001. In February 2000, a similar suit captioned

LaPray v.
Compaq

was filed in state court in Jefferson County, Texas. The basic allegation is that HP and Compaq sold computers containing floppy disk controllers that
fail to alert the user to certain floppy disk controller errors. That failure is alleged to result in data loss or data corruption. The complaints in

Alvis

and

LaPray

seek injunctive relief,
declaratory relief, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. In July 2001, a nationwide class was certified in the

LaPray

case, which the Beaumont Court of Appeals affirmed in
June 2002. In May 2004, the Texas Supreme Court
reversed the certification of the nationwide class in the

LaPray

case and remanded the case to the trial court. The


trial
court has not set a new class certification hearing. A class certification hearing was held on July 1, 2003 in the

Alvis

case, and the court granted plaintiffs' motion to certify a
nationwide class action. HP filed an appeal of that
certification with the 9th Court of Appeals in Beaumont, Texas, which heard oral arguments on HP's appeal and received a supplemental briefing based upon the

LaPray

opinion from the Texas Supreme
Court. On August 31, 2004, the 9th Court of Appeals in Texas reversed the
lower court's decision certifying a nationwide class and remanded the case to the trial court. A class certification hearing was held, and the court has notified the parties that it will certify a
Texas-wide class action for injunctive relief only. On June 4, 2003,

Barrett v. HP

and

Grider v. Compaq

were each filed in state court
in Cleveland County, Oklahoma, with factual allegations similar to those in

Alvis

and

LaPray

. The complaints in

Barrett

and

Grider

seek, among other things,
specific performance, declaratory relief, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. On November 5, 2003, the court heard HP's motion to dismiss

Barrett v.
HP

and

Grider v. Compaq

, which motion was subsequently denied. On
December 22, 2003, the court entered an order staying both the

Barrett

and

Grider

cases until the conclusions of the

Alvis

and

LaPray

actions. On July 28,
2004, the Court lifted the stay in

Grider

, but took under advisement the plaintiff's motion to lift the stay in

Barrett

. On November 5,
2004,

Scott v.
HP

was filed in state court in San Joaquin County, California, with factual allegations similar to those in

Alvis

and

LaPray

. The complaint in

Scott

seeks class certification, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (including punitive damages), restitution, costs
and attorneys' fees. In addition, the Civil Division of the Department of Justice, the General Services Administration Office of Inspector General and other Federal agencies are conducting an
investigation of allegations that HP and Compaq made or caused to be made false claims for payment to the United States for computers known by HP and Compaq to contain defective parts or otherwise to
perform in a defective manner relating to the same alleged floppy disk controller errors. HP agreed with the Department of Justice to extend the statute of limitations on its investigation until
June 6, 2005. HP is cooperating fully with this investigation.

On
December 27, 2001,

Cornell University and the Cornell Research Foundation, Inc.

filed an
action against HP in United States District Court for the Northern District of New York alleging that HP's PA-RISC 8000 family of microprocessors, and servers and workstations
incorporating those processors, infringes a patent assigned to Cornell Research Foundation, Inc. that describes a way of executing microprocessor instructions. HP has answered and counterclaimed. This
action seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and unspecified damages. On March 26, 2004, the court issued a ruling interpreting the disputed claims terms in the patent at issue. Discovery is
ongoing, and no trial date has been set.

HP v. EMC Corporation

("EMC") is a lawsuit filed in United States District Court for the Northern District of
California on September 30, 2002, in which HP accuses EMC of infringing seven HP patents. HP seeks damages, an injunction, prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees. On July 21,
2003, EMC filed its answer and a cross-claim asserting, among other things, that numerous HP storage, server and printer products infringe six EMC patents. EMC seeks a permanent injunction as well as
unspecified monetary damages, costs and attorneys' fees for patent infringement. The court issued an order construing disputed claim terms on June 23, 2004. Discovery is ongoing. Trial is
expected in late 2005 or early 2006. Subsequently, HP filed a second lawsuit in United States District Court for the Northern District of California, in which HP accuses additional models of certain
EMC products of infringing the same seven HP patents. HP seeks damages, an injunction, prejudgment interest, costs and attorneys' fees. EMC also filed suit against StorageApps, a company acquired by
HP in fiscal 2001, in United States District Court in Worcester, Massachusetts on October 20, 2000. The suit accused StorageApps of infringement of EMC patents relating to storage devices, and
sought a


permanent
injunction as well as unspecified monetary damages for patent infringement. The court held a hearing to construe the disputed claims terms of EMC's three patents in the suit on
July 21-22, 2003 and issued its claim construction ruling on September 12, 2003. Following a trial in May 2004, the jury found that three of EMC's patents are valid
and infringed. The damages phase of the litigation has commenced, and a trial on the issue of damages is scheduled to begin on February 17, 2005. HP is appealing the judgment of liability.

Neubauer, et al. v. Intel Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, et al.

and

Neubauer, et al. v. Compaq Computer
Corporation

are separate lawsuits filed on June 3, 2002 in state court in
Madison County, Illinois, alleging that HP and Compaq (along with Intel) misled the public by suppressing and concealing the alleged material fact that systems that use the Intel Pentium 4 processor
are less powerful and slower than systems using the Intel Pentium III processor and processors made by a competitor of Intel. The court in the HP action has certified an Illinois class as to Intel but
denied a nationwide class. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, restitution, attorneys' fees and costs and certification of a nationwide class against HP and Compaq. The class action certification
hearings against HP and Compaq have not been scheduled. In each action, HP and Compaq have filed motions to dismiss the cases, which the court has denied. HP and Compaq also have filed forum non
conveniens motions, which are pending.

Skold, et al. v. Intel Corporation and Hewlett-Packard Company

is a lawsuit in state
court in Alameda County, California to which HP was joined on June 14, 2004, based upon factual allegations similar to those in the

Neubauer

cases. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages,
restitution, attorneys' fees and cost and certification of
nationwide class.

Forgent Networks v. HP et al.

is a lawsuit filed on April 22, 2004 against HP as well as 30 other
companies in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint accuses HP of patent infringement with respect to HP's products that implement JPEG compression. JPEG is a
standard for data compression used in HP's PCs, scanners, digital cameras, PDAs, and non-photo-printers. Forgent seeks unspecified damages, an injunction, interest, costs and attorneys'
fees. Separately, HP has alerted government regulators of Forgent's participation in the JPEG standardization process and current licensing activities. Trial has been set for October 2005.

Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP v. Gateway, Inc.

is a lawsuit filed on March 24, 2004
by HP's wholly-owned subsidiary, Hewlett-Packard Development Company, LP ("HPDC"), against Gateway, Inc. in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of California, alleging infringement of
six patents relating to various notebook, desktop and enterprise computer technologies. On April 2, 2004, HPDC filed an amended complaint, adding infringement allegations for four additional
patents. HPDC seeks an injunction, unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys' fees. On May 10, 2004, Gateway filed an answer and a counterclaim, alleging infringement of five Gateway
patents relating to computerized television, wireless, computer monitoring and computer expansion card technologies. Gateway seeks an injunction, unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys'
fees. Claim construction is scheduled to begin on January 24-25, 2005. On May 6, 2004, HPDC and HP filed a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission ("ITC") against Gateway,
alleging infringement of seven additional computer technology patents. HP seeks an injunction. On October 21, 2004, HPDC filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District
of Wisconsin against eMachines, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gateway, alleging infringement of five HPDC patents relating to personal and desktop computers, of which three patents remain in suit. HPDC
seeks an injunction, unspecified monetary damages, interest and attorneys' fees.


On July 2, 2004, Gateway filed a complaint with the ITC against HP, alleging infringement of three patents relating to audio control, imaging and
computerized television technologies. Gateway seeks an injunction. Also on July 2, 2004, Amiga Development LLC ("Amiga"), an entity affiliated with Gateway, filed a lawsuit against HP in the
Eastern District of Texas, alleging infringement of three patents relating to computer monitoring, imaging and decoder technologies. Gateway seeks an injunction, unspecified monetary damages, interest
and attorneys' fees. HP and HPDC have answered and counterclaimed, alleging infringement by Amiga and Gateway of four HPDC patents related to personal computer technology. On August 18, 2004,
Gateway filed a declaratory relief action against HPDC in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California seeking a declaration of non-infringement and invalidity of the
above-referenced four HPDC patents relating to personal computer technology. HPDC answered and counterclaimed and alleged infringement of the same four patents. HP seeks an injunction, unspecified
monetary damages, interest and attorneys' fees. Claim construction is scheduled to begin in January 2005.

Hanrahan v. Hewlett-Packard Company and Carleton Fiorina

is a lawsuit filed on November 3, 2003, in
the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut on behalf of a putative class of persons who sold common stock of HP during the period from September 4, 2001 through
November 5, 2001. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages and generally alleges that HP and Ms. Fiorina violated the federal securities laws by making statements during this period which
were misleading in failing to disclose that Walter B. Hewlett would oppose the proposed acquisition of Compaq by HP prior to Mr. Hewlett's disclosure of his opposition to the proposed
transaction. A motion to transfer the action to federal court in California is pending, and no lead plaintiff has yet been appointed.

Stevens v. HP

(renamed as

Erickson v.
HP

) is an unfair business practices consumer class action filed in the Superior Court of California in Riverside County on July 31, 2000. Consumer class
action lawsuits have been filed, in coordination with the original plaintiffs, in 33 additional jurisdictions. The various plaintiffs throughout the country claim to have purchased different models of
HP inkjet printers. The basic factual allegation of these actions is that affected consumers who purchased HP printers received half-full or "economy" ink cartridges instead of full
cartridges. Plaintiffs claim that HP's advertising, packaging and marketing representations for the printers led the consumers to believe they would receive full cartridges. These actions seek
injunctive relief, disgorgement of profits, compensatory damages, punitive damages and attorneys' fees under various state unfair business practices statutes and common law claims of fraud and
negligent misrepresentation. In the initial California matter, the court granted summary judgment in HP's favor and denied class certification. In October of 2003, the California appellate court
affirmed the lower court's decisions and dismissed plaintiff's appeal. The matter was certified as a class action in North Carolina state court, where it was filed as

Hughes v. Hewlett-Packard Company

. HP prevailed at the trial of this case, which concluded in September 2003.
The litigation is not in trial in other jurisdictions and the other cases have not been certified as class actions. Plaintiffs' counsel in all 33 jurisdictions have signed a dismissal agreement, which
provides that all of the cases will be dismissed. Thus far twenty-one of the actions have been dismissed.

Digwamaje et al. v. Bank of America et al.

is a purported class action lawsuit that names HP and numerous
other multinational corporations as defendants. It was filed on September 27, 2002 in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of current and former South


African
citizens and their survivors who suffered violence and oppression under the apartheid regime. The lawsuit alleges that HP and other companies helped perpetuate, and profited from, the
apartheid regime during the period from 1948-1994 by selling products and services to agencies of the South African government. Claims are based on the Alien Tort Claims Act, the Torture
Protection Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and state law. The complaint seeks, among other things, an accounting, the creation of a historic commission, compensatory
damages in excess of $200 billion, punitive damages in excess of $200 billion, costs and attorneys' fees. The court subsequently dismissed the plaintiffs' complaint, and plaintiffs have
appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.

In
May 2002, the European Commission of the EU publicly stated that it was considering conducting an investigation into OEM activities concerning the sales of printers and
supplies to consumers within the EU. The European Commission contacted HP requesting information on the printing systems businesses. HP is cooperating fully with this inquiry.

In
March 2003, the Korea Fair Trade Commission commenced an investigation of the Korean printing and supplies market. The Korea Fair Trade Commission contacted HP requesting
information on its printing systems business. A hearing is expected to be held in 2005. HP is cooperating fully with this inquiry.

The
Government of Canada conducted cost audits of certain contracts between Public Works and Government Services Canada ("PWGSC") and each of Compaq Canada Corp. and Hewlett-Packard
(Canada) Co. relating to services provided to the Canadian Department of National Defence ("DND"). Compaq Canada Corp. was combined with Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Co. following HP's acquisition of
Compaq. HP cooperated fully with the audit and has conducted its own inquiry, sharing the results of its investigation with PWGSC and DND. On May 14, 2004, HP announced that it had resolved the
dispute with the Government of Canada. HP Canada agreed to reimburse the Government of Canada the sum of CDN$146 million (approximately US$105 million), an amount determined by both
parties to be appropriate upon investigation. HP recorded $70 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2004 and had recorded $35 million in the prior fiscal year. HP determined that it
was important for HP to honor its contractual obligations, rather than engage in protracted litigation with the Government of Canada, despite the lack of evidence that HP employees derived any
improper benefit from the complex scheme
designed to exploit both parties. HP has initiated proceedings to recover these funds from responsible individuals, and continues to consider further proceedings against others to recover additional
funds.

HP
is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified above, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities, employment, employee
benefits and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies," HP makes a provision for a liability when it
is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. HP believes it has adequate provisions for any such matters. HP reviews these provisions at
least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impacts of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other information and events pertaining to a particular case.
Based on its experience, HP believes that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters discussed above are not a meaningful indicator of HP's potential liability. Litigation is inherently
unpredictable. However, HP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Nevertheless, it is possible that cash flows or


results
of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies.

Environmental

HP is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by United States or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), known as "Superfund," or state laws similar to CERCLA. HP is also conducting environmental investigations or remediations at several current or former
operating sites pursuant to administrative orders or consent agreements with state environmental agencies. It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside and
outside the United States, even if not subject to regulations imposed by local governments. The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when it is considered
probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Historically, environmental costs have not been material to our operations or financial position.

Note 18: Segment Information

Description of Segments

HP is a leading global provider of products, technologies, solutions and services to individual consumers and businesses. HP's offerings span IT infrastructure
and storage, personal computing and other access devices, multi-vendor services including maintenance, consulting and integration and outsourcing, and imaging and printing.

During
fiscal 2004, HP organized its operations into seven business segments: PSG, IPG, ESS, HPS, HP Financial Services ("HPFS"), Software, and Corporate Investments. Given the
cross-segment linkages in our Adaptive Enterprise offering, and in order to capitalize on up-selling and cross-selling opportunities, ESS, HPS and Software are structured beneath a broader Technology
Solutions Group ("TSG"), in order to provide a supplementary view of HP's business. HP's organizational structure is based on a number of factors that management uses to evaluate, view and run its
business operations which include, but are not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products and technology. The business segments disclosed in the Consolidated Financial Statements are based on
this organizational structure and information reviewed by HP's management to evaluate the business segment results. At the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2004, HP divided its Enterprise
Systems Group into the ESS segment and Software segment. Segment operating results for fiscal 2003 and 2002 have been restated to reflect this organizational change as well as certain minor product
reclassifications. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the business segments disclosed. A description of the types of products and services provided by each
business segment follows.

Technology Solutions Group's

mission is to coordinate HP's Adaptive Enterprise offering across organizations to create solutions that
allow customers to manage and transform their business and IT environments. TSG allows HP to leverage the resources and capabilities of the HP portfolio by applying key design principles consistently

Segment Data

The results of the business segments are derived directly from HP's internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive business segment
results are substantially the same as those used by the consolidated company. Management measures the performance of each business segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations.
These results are used, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the business segments. Certain operating expenses, which HP manages separately at the corporate
level, are not allocated to the business segments. These unallocated costs include primarily amortization of purchased intangible assets, certain acquisition-related charges and charges for purchased
IPR&D as well as certain corporate governance costs.


Restructuring
charges and any associated adjustments thereto related to restructuring actions initiated prior to fiscal 2004 are not allocated to the business segments.

Selected
operating results information for each business segment, as well as for TSG, was as follows for the fiscal years ended October 31:

ITEM 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure.

None.

ITEM 9A. Controls and Procedures.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the "Evaluation Date"). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer
concluded as of the Evaluation Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective such that the information relating to HP, including our consolidated subsidiaries, required to be
disclosed in our Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") reports (i) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and
(ii) is accumulated and communicated to HP's management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
