PART I

ITEM 1. Business.

HP is a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses ("SMBs")
and large enterprises, including in the public and education sectors. Our offerings span:

•

personal
computing and other access devices,

•

imaging
and printing-related products and services,

•

enterprise
information technology infrastructure, including enterprise storage and server technology and software that optimizes business technology investments, and

•

multi-vendor
customer services, including technology support and maintenance, consulting and integration and outsourcing services.

HP
was incorporated in 1947 under the laws of the State of California as the successor to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard. Effective in
May 1998, we changed our state of incorporation from California to Delaware.

HP Products and Services; Segment Information

During fiscal 2007, our operations were organized into seven business segments: Enterprise Storage and Servers ("ESS"), HP Services ("HPS"), HP Software, the
Personal Systems Group ("PSG"), the Imaging and Printing Group ("IPG"), HP Financial Services ("HPFS") and Corporate Investments. Given the solution sale approach across our enterprise offerings, and
in order to capitalize on up-selling and cross-selling opportunities, ESS, HPS and HP Software are structured beneath a broader


Technology
Solutions Group ("TSG"). While TSG is not a business segment, this aggregation provides a supplementary view of our business. In each of the past three fiscal years, industry standard
servers, desktops, notebooks and printing supplies each accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenue.

A
summary of our net revenue, earnings from operations and assets for our segments and business units is found in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which
is incorporated herein by reference. A discussion of factors potentially affecting our operations is set forth in "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Technology Solutions Group

TSG provides servers, storage, software and information technology ("IT") services that enable enterprise and midmarket business customers to better manage their
current IT environments and transform IT into a business enabler. TSG products help accelerate growth, minimize risk and reduce costs to optimize the business outcomes of customers' IT investments.
Companies around the globe leverage HP's infrastructure solutions to deploy next generation data centers and address business challenges ranging from compliance to business continuity. TSG's modular
IT systems and services are primarily standards-based and feature differentiated technologies in areas including power and cooling, unified management, security, virtualization and automation. Each of
the three business segments within TSG is described in detail below.

Enterprise Storage and Servers

The server market continues to shift towards standards-based architectures as proprietary hardware and operating systems are replaced by industry standard server
platforms that typically offer compelling
price and performance advantages by leveraging standards-based operating systems and microprocessor designs. At the same time, critical business functions continue to demand scalability and
reliability. By providing a broad portfolio of storage and server solutions, ESS aims to optimize the combined product solutions required by different customers and provide solutions for a wide range
of operating environments, spanning both the enterprise and the SMB markets. ESS provides storage and server products in a number of categories.

Industry Standard Servers.

Industry standard servers include primarily entry-level and mid-range ProLiant
servers, which run primarily Windows®,

(1)

Linux and Novell operating systems and leverage Intel Corporation ("Intel") and Advanced Micro Devices ("AMD") processors. The
business spans a range of product lines that include pedestal-tower servers, density-optimized rack servers and HP's BladeSystem family of server blades. In fiscal 2007, HP's industry standard server
business continued to lead the industry in terms of units shipped and factory revenue. HP also has a leadership position in server blades, the fastest-growing segment of the market.

Business Critical Systems.

Business Critical Systems include Itanium®

(2)

-based Integrity servers
running on the HP-UX, Windows®, Linux and OpenVMS operating systems, including the high-end Superdome servers and fault-tolerant Integrity NonStop servers. Business
Critical Systems also include the Reduced Instruction Set Computing ("RISC")-based servers with the HP 9000 line running on the HP-UX operating system, HP AlphaServers running on both
Tru64 UNIX®

(3)

and OpenVMS, and MIPs-based NonStop servers.

Storage.

HP's StorageWorks offerings include entry-level, mid-range and high-end arrays, storage area
networks, network attached storage, storage management software and virtualization technologies, as well as tape drives, tape libraries and optical archival storage.

HP Services

HPS provides a portfolio of multi-vendor IT services, including technology services, consulting and integration and outsourcing services. HPS also offers a
variety of services tailored to particular industries such as communications, media and entertainment, manufacturing and distribution, financial services, health and life sciences and the public
sector, including government services. HPS collaborates with the Enterprise Storage and Servers and HP Software groups, as well as with third-party system integrators and software and networking
companies to bring solutions to HP customers. HPS also works with HP's Imaging and Printing Group and Personal Systems Group to provide managed print services, end user workplace services, and mobile
workforce productivity solutions to enterprise customers.

Technology Services.

HPS provides a range of technology services from standalone product support to high availability
services for complex, global, networked, multi-vendor environments. This business also manages the delivery of product warranty support through its own service organization, as well as through
authorized partners.

Consulting and Integration.

HPS provides consulting and integration services to architect, design and implement technology
and industry-specific solutions for customers. Consulting and integration also provides cross-industry solutions in the areas of architecture and governance, infrastructure, applications and packaged
applications, security, IT service management, information management and enterprise Microsoft solutions.

Outsourcing Services.

HPS offers a variety of IT management and outsourcing services that support customers' infrastructure,
applications, business processes, end user workplace, print environment and business continuity and recovery requirements.

HP Software

HP Software provides a suite of Business Technology Optimization ("BTO") software solutions, including support, that allow customers to manage and automate their
IT infrastructure, operations, applications, IT services and business processes under the OpenView brand. In addition, this segment delivers a suite of comprehensive, carrier-grade software platforms
for developing and deploying next-generation voice, data and converged services to network and service providers under the HP OpenCall brand.

We
are focused on extending our enterprise systems management leadership position into application, service management and business process management market segments. During fiscal
2007, we completed the acquisitions of Mercury Interactive Corporation, Bristol Technologies, Inc., SPI Dynamics, Inc. and Opsware Inc., which added transaction monitoring,
applications security testing and data center automation capabilities to the BTO portfolio. We expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions as well as undertake internal realignments as we deem
appropriate. The portfolio of BTO solutions is designed to enable our customers to reduce their IT costs, and gain better insight to their business and IT operations. This helps our customers align IT
resources with their business goals and automate data center operations and IT processes, enabling IT to deliver more value to the business.

Personal Systems Group

PSG is the leading provider of personal computers ("PCs") in the world based on unit volume shipped and annual revenue. PSG provides commercial PCs, consumer PCs,
workstations, handheld


computing
devices, digital entertainment systems, calculators and other related accessories, software and services for the commercial and consumer markets. We group commercial desktops, commercial
notebooks and workstations into commercial clients and consumer desktop and consumer notebooks into consumer clients when describing our performance in these markets. Like the broader PC market, PSG
continues to experience a shift toward mobile products such as notebooks. Both commercial and consumer PCs are based predominately on the Windows® operating system and use Intel and AMD
processors.

Commercial PCs.

PSG offers a variety of personal computers optimized for commercial uses, including enterprise and SMB
customers, and for connectivity and manageability in networked environments. These commercial PCs include primarily the HP Compaq business desktops, business notebooks, and Tablet PCs.

Consumer PCs.

Consumer PCs include the HP Pavilion and Compaq Presario series of multi-media consumer desktops and notebooks,
as well as HP Media Center and Voodoo Gaming PCs, which are targeted at the home user.

Workstations.

Workstations are individual computing products designed for users demanding enhanced performance, such as
computer animation, engineering design and other programs requiring high-resolution graphics. HP provides workstations that run on UNIX®, Windows® and Linux-based
operating systems.

Handheld Computing.

HP provides a series of HP iPAQ Pocket PC handheld computing devices that run on Windows®
Mobile software. These products range from value devices such as music or Global Positioning System receivers to advanced devices with voice and data capability.

Digital Entertainment.

PSG's digital entertainment products are targeted at the intersection of the personal computing and
consumer electronics markets and span a range of products and product categories that allow customers to enjoy a broad range of digital entertainment experiences. PSG's digital entertainment products
include HD DVD and RW drives and DVD writers; plasma and LCD flat-panel televisions; and the HP Digital Entertainment Center, which allows consumers to access their music, movies, home
videos and photos from a single device via remote control.

Imaging and Printing Group

IPG is the leading imaging and printing systems provider in the world for consumer and commercial printer hardware, printing supplies, printing media and scanning
devices. IPG is also focused on imaging solutions in the commercial markets, from managed print services solutions to addressing new growth opportunities in commercial printing in areas such as
industrial applications, outdoor signage, and the graphic arts business. When describing our performance in this segment, we group inkjet printer units and digital photography and entertainment
products and services into consumer hardware, LaserJet printers and graphics and imaging products into commercial hardware and break out printer supplies separately.

Inkjet Printers.

Inkjet systems include desktop single function and inkjet all-in-one printers,
including photo, productivity and business inkjet printers and scanners.

Digital Photography and Entertainment.

Digital imaging products and services include photo specialty printers, photo kiosks,
digital cameras, accessories and online photo services through Snapfish. An important part of IPG's strategy is to provide digital imaging solutions that rival traditional imaging for quality, cost
and ease of use so that consumers can manage their digital imaging throughout the home and outside the home. On November 7, 2007, we announced that we were seeking an alternative business model
for our HP-branded cameras.


LaserJet Printers.

LaserJet systems include monochrome and color laser printers, printer-based multi-function devices and
Total Print Management Solutions for enterprise customers. A key initiative in this area of IPG's business has been and continues to be driving color printing penetration in the office.

Graphics and Imaging.

Graphics and Imaging products include large format (DesignJet) printers, Indigo and Scitex digital
presses, digital publishing solutions and graphics printing solutions. A key initiative for IPG is to capture high-value pages by developing compelling solutions for the industrial,
commercial printing and graphics segments.

Printer Supplies.

Printer supplies include LaserJet toner and inkjet cartridges and other printing-related media. These
supplies include HP-branded Vivera and ColorSphere ink and HP Premium and Premium Plus photo papers, which are designed to work together as a system to produce faster prints with improved
resistance to fading, increased print quality and better affordability.

HP Financial Services

HPFS supports and enhances HP's global product and service solutions, providing a broad range of value-added financial life-cycle management services. HPFS
enables our worldwide customers to acquire complete IT solutions, including hardware, software and services. The group offers leasing, financing, utility programs and asset recovery services, as well
as financial asset management services for large global and enterprise customers. HPFS also provides an array of specialized financial services to SMBs and educational and governmental entities. HPFS
offers innovative, customized and flexible alternatives to balance unique customer cash flow, technology obsolescence and capacity needs.

Corporate Investments

Corporate Investments is managed by the Office of Strategy and Technology and includes Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, also known as HP Labs, and certain business
incubation projects. Revenue in this segment is attributable to the sale of certain network infrastructure products, including Ethernet switch products that enhance computing and enterprise solutions
under the brand ProCurve Networking. Corporate Investments also derives revenue from licensing specific HP technology to third parties.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We manage our business and report our financial results based on the principal business segments described above. Our customers are organized by consumer and
commercial customer groups, and distribution is organized by direct and channel. Within the channel, we have various types of partners that we utilize for various customer groups. The partners
include:

•

retailers
that sell our products to the public through their own physical or Internet stores;

•

resellers
that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer groups;

•

distribution
partners that supply our solutions to smaller resellers with which we do not have direct relationships;

•

independent
distributors that sell our products into geographies or customer segments in which we have little or no presence;

•

original
equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") that integrate our products with their own hardware or software and sell the integrated products;


•

independent
software vendors ("ISVs") that provide their clients with specialized software products, frequently driving sales of additional non-HP products and
services, and often assist us in selling our products and services to clients purchasing their products; and

•

systems
integrators that provide various levels and kinds of expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often partner with HPS to extend their expertise
or influence the sale of our products and services.

The
mix of HP's business by channel or direct sales differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market conditions
necessitate sales, marketing and distribution to be tailored accordingly. HP is focused on driving efficiencies and productivity gains in both the direct and indirect business.

TSG
manages enterprise and public sector customer relationships and also is charged with simplifying sales processes across our segments to improve speed and effectiveness of customer
delivery. In this capacity, TSG manages our direct sales for both volume and value products including industry standard servers products, UNIX®, enterprise storage and software and
pre-sales technical consultants, as well as our direct distribution activities for commercial products and go-to-market activities with systems integrators and
ISVs. TSG also drives HP's vertical sales and marketing approach in the communication, media and entertainment, financial services, manufacturing and distribution and public sector industries.

PSG
manages SMB customer relationships and commercial reseller channels, due largely to the significant volume of commercial PCs that HP sells through these channels. In addition to
commercial channel relationships, the volume direct organization, which is charged with the management of direct sales for volume products, is hosted within PSG.

IPG
manages HP's overall consumer-related sales and marketing activities, including our annual consumer product launch for the back-to-school and holiday seasons.
IPG also manages consumer channel relationships with third-party retail locations for imaging and printing products, as well as other consumer products, including consumer PCs, which provides for a
bundled
sale opportunity between PCs and IPG products. In addition, IPG manages direct consumer sales online through HP Home & Home Office.

Manufacturing and Materials

We utilize a number of contract manufacturers ("CMs") and original design manufacturers ("ODMs") around the world to manufacture HP-designed products.
The use of CMs and ODMs is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for certain HP-designed products. Third-party OEMs manufacture some
products that we purchase and resell under the HP brand. In addition to our use of CMs and ODMs, we currently manufacture finished products from components and sub-assemblies that
we acquire from a wide range of vendors.

We
utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We employ building products to order capabilities to
maximize manufacturing efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Configuring products to order permits configuration of units to the particular hardware and software
customization requirements of certain customers. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory
holding periods by taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing immediately prior to the sale or distribution of products to our customers.

We
purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For many of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply, or such sources
are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for laser printer engines, LaserJet supplies and parts for


products
with short life cycles (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations). We are dependent upon Intel as a supplier of processors and Microsoft for various software
products. However, we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our
competitors. We also have a valued relationship with AMD, and we have continued to see solid acceptance of AMD processors in the market during fiscal 2007.

Like
other participants in the high technology industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our
requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we experience significant price volatility and supply constraints of certain components that are not available from
multiple sources. Frequently, we are able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have
an impact on gross margin but does not disrupt production. On occasion, we acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments
with vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. See "Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to
manage supplier issues properly," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

International

Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis for both consumer and
enterprise customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, allows us to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams to
offset geographic economic trends and offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. In addition, we believe that future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop
products and sales models that target developing countries. In this regard, we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base upon which to build such future growth.

A
summary of our domestic and international net revenue and net property, plant and equipment is set forth in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is
incorporated herein by reference. Approximately 67% of our overall net revenue in fiscal 2007 came from outside the United States. The substantial majority of our net revenue originating outside the
United States was from customers other than foreign governments.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to HP's foreign operations, see "Risk Factors—Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other
factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition," in Item 1A, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk" in Item 7A and Note 9 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Research and Development

We remain committed to innovation as a key element of HP's culture. Our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products, services and
solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make a unique
contribution and the areas where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences.


HP Labs, together with the various research and development groups within the five principal business segments, are responsible for our research and development efforts. HP Labs is part
of our Corporate Investments segment.

Expenditures
for research and development were $3.6 billion in each of fiscal years 2007 and 2006 and $3.5 billion in fiscal 2005. We anticipate that we will continue to
have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services to maintain and enhance our competitive
position.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see "Risk Factors—If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and
services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may suffer," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Patents

Our general policy has been to seek patent protection for those inventions and improvements likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where
proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At October 31, 2007, our worldwide patent portfolio included over 31,000 patents, which was slightly above the number of patents in our
patent portfolio at the end of both fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005.

Patents
generally have a term of twenty years from the time they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms on the individual patents vary. While we
believe that our patents and applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and maximizing our return on research and development investments, no single
patent is in itself essential to us as a whole or any of our principal business segments.

In
addition to developing our patents, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses under
patents owned by us when we consider these arrangements to be in our interests. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors—Our revenue, cost of sales, and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or
enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by
reference.

Backlog

We believe that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects due to the large volume of products delivered from shelf or channel partner
inventories, the shortening of product life cycles and the relative portion of net revenue related to our service and support businesses. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not material
to an understanding of our overall business.

Seasonality

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our products experience weak
economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example, European sales often are weaker in the summer months and
consumer sales often are stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Demand during the spring and early summer months also may be adversely impacted by market anticipation of seasonal trends. See "Risk
Factors—Our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable," in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.


Competition

We encounter aggressive competition in all areas of our business activity. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality,
reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account relationships, customer training, service and support, security and availability of
application software and our Internet infrastructure offerings.

The
markets for each of our business segments are characterized by vigorous competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and
rapidly growing firms. Product life cycles are short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete
effectively on the basis of the factors listed above. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and often market their
products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships will continue to be critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have
to continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.

On
an overall basis we are among the largest U.S.-based companies offering our range of general purpose computers and personal information, imaging and printing products for industrial,
scientific, business and consumer applications, and IT services. We are the leader or among the leaders in each of our principal business segments.

The
competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below:

Enterprise Storage and Servers.

The areas in which ESS operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid and
ongoing technological innovation and price reductions. Our competitors range from broad solutions providers such as International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") to more focused competitors such
as EMC Corporation and Network Appliance, Inc. in storage, Dell, Inc. ("Dell") in industry standard servers, and Sun Microsystems, Inc. in both industry standard and
UNIX®-based servers. We believe that our important competitive advantages in this segment include the six technology components of our adaptive infrastructure initiatives: IT systems,
power and cooling, security, management, virtualization and automation. We believe that our competitive advantages also include our global reach and our significant intellectual property portfolio and
research and development capabilities, which will contribute to further enhancements of our product offerings and our ability to cross sell our portfolio and leverage scale advantages in everything
from brand to procurement leverage.

HP Services.

HPS competes in IT support services, consulting and integration and outsourcing services. The IT support
services and consulting and integration markets have been under significant pressure as our customers have reduced their IT budgets. However, this trend has benefited the outsourcing services business
as customers look at reducing IT management costs to enable more strategic investments. Our competitors include IBM Global Services, systems integration firms such as Accenture Ltd.,
outsourcing firms such as Electronic Data Systems Corporation, and offshore companies. We also compete with other traditional hardware providers, such as Dell, which are increasingly offering services
to support their products. Many of our competitors are able to offer a wide range of global services, and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand recognition. HPS teams with many companies to
offer services, and those arrangements allow us to extend our reach and augment our capabilities. Our competitive advantages are evident in our deep technology expertise, which includes multi-vendor
environments, virtualization and automation, our strong track record of collaboration with clients and partners, and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global
resources in SAP, Oracle and Microsoft platforms.

HP Software.

Our software competitors include companies focused on providing software solutions for IT management, such as
BMC Software Inc, CA Inc., and IBM Tivoli Software.


Personal Systems Group.

The areas in which PSG operates are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid price
reductions and inventory depreciation. Our primary competitors for the branded personal computers are Dell, Acer Inc, Apple Inc., Lenovo Group Limited and Toshiba Corporation. In particular regions,
we also experience competition from local companies and from generically-branded or "white box" manufacturers. Our competitive advantages include our broad product portfolio, our innovation and
research and development capabilities, our brand and procurement leverage, our ability to cross sell our portfolio of offerings, our extensive service and support offerings and the availability of our
broad-based distribution of products from retail and commercial channels to direct sales.

Imaging and Printing Group.

We are the leading imaging and printing systems provider in the world for printer hardware,
printing supplies and scanning devices. We believe that our brand recognition, reputation for quality, breadth of product offerings and large customer base are important competitive advantages.
However, the markets for printer hardware and associated supplies are highly competitive, especially with respect to pricing and the introduction of new products and features. IPG's key competitors
include Canon USA, Inc., Lexmark International, Inc., Xerox Corporation ("Xerox"), Seiko Epson Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Dell. In addition, independent
suppliers offer refill and remanufactured alternatives for our supplies which, although generally offering lower print quality and reliability, may be offered at lower prices and put pressure on our
supplies sales and margins. Other companies also have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for HP's laser and inkjet products, particularly in jurisdictions outside of the United States
where adequate intellectual property protection may not exist. In recent years, we and our competitors have regularly lowered prices on printer hardware both to reach new customers and in response to
the competitive environment. Important areas for future growth include digital photography in the home and outside the home, printer-based multi-function devices in the office space, digital presses
in our imaging and graphics space and driving color printing expansion in the office. While we encounter competitors in some product categories whose current market share is greater than ours, such as
Xerox in copiers and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen Aktiengesellschaft in publishing, we believe we will provide important new contributions in the home, the office and publishing environments by
providing comprehensive solutions.

HP Financial Services.

In our financing business, our competitors are captive financing companies, mainly IBM Global
Financing, as well as banks and financial institutions. We believe our competitive advantage in this business over banks and financial institutions is our ability to finance products, services and
total solutions.

Environment

Some of our operations use substances regulated under various federal, state, local and international laws governing the environment, including laws governing the
discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. Many of our products are subject to various
federal, state, local and international laws governing chemical substances in products, including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and laws restricting the
presence of certain substances in electronics products. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party damage or personal injury claims,
if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws. We also face increasing complexity in our product design
and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to the materials composition of our products, including the restrictions on


lead,
cadmium and certain other substances that apply to specified electronics products put on the market in the European Union (the "EU") as of July 1, 2006 (Restriction of Hazardous
Substances Directive) and similar legislation in China, the labeling provisions of which went into effect March 1, 2007. We also could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with
product take-back legislation. The EU has enacted the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, which makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers,
financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. The deadline for the individual member states of the EU to enact the directive
in their respective countries was August 13, 2004 (such legislation, together with the directive, the "WEEE Legislation"). Producers participating in the market became financially responsible
for implementing their responsibilities under the WEEE Legislation beginning in August 2005. Implementation in certain EU member states was delayed into 2006 and 2007. Similar legislation has
been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China and Japan. It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to sites inside
and outside the United States, even if we are not subject to regulations imposed by local governments. The liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when HP
considers it probable and can reasonably estimate the costs. Environmental costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations or financial position, and we do not currently anticipate
material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

ITEM 1A. Risk Factors.

Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results, past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future
performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods.

The competitive pressures we face could harm our revenue, gross margin and prospects.

We encounter aggressive competition from numerous and varied competitors in all areas of our business, and our competitors may target our key market segments. We
compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products, account
relationships, customer training, service and support, security, availability of application software, and Internet infrastructure offerings. If our products, services, support and cost structure do
not enable us to compete successfully based on any of those criteria, our operations, results and prospects could be harmed.


Unlike
many of our competitors, we have a portfolio of businesses and must allocate resources across these businesses while competing with companies that specialize in one or more of
these product lines. As a result, we may invest less in certain areas of our businesses than our competitors do, and these competitors may have greater financial, technical and marketing resources
available to them than our businesses that compete against them. Industry consolidation also may affect competition by creating larger, more homogeneous and potentially stronger competitors in the
markets in which we compete, and our competitors also may affect our business by entering into exclusive arrangements with existing or potential customers or suppliers.

We
may have to continue to lower the prices of many of our products and services to stay competitive, while at the same time trying to maintain or improve revenue and gross margin. The
markets in which we do business, particularly the personal computer and printing markets, are highly competitive, and we encounter aggressive price competition for all of our products and services
from numerous companies globally. Over the past several years, price competition in the market for personal computers, printers and related products has been particularly intense as competitors have
aggressively cut prices and lowered their product margins for these products. Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by these and other industry-wide
pricing pressures.

Because
our business model is based on providing innovative and high quality products, we may spend a proportionately greater amount on research and development than some of our
competitors. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure on a timely basis in response to competitive price pressures, our gross margin and therefore our profitability could be adversely
affected. In addition, if our pricing and other factors are not sufficiently competitive, or if there is an adverse reaction to our product decisions, we may lose market share in certain areas, which
could adversely affect our revenue and prospects.

Even
if we are able to maintain or increase market share for a particular product, revenue could decline because the product is in a maturing industry. Revenue and margins also could
decline due to increased competition from other types of products. For example, refill and remanufactured alternatives for some of HP's LaserJet toner and inkjet cartridges compete with HP's supplies
business. In addition, other companies have developed and marketed new compatible cartridges for HP's LaserJet and inkjet products, particularly in jurisdictions outside of the United States where
adequate intellectual property protection may not exist. HP expects competitive refill and remanufacturing and cloned cartridge activity to continue to pressure margins in IPG, which in turn has a
significant impact on HP margins and profitability overall.

If we cannot continue to develop, manufacture and market products and services that meet customer requirements for innovation and quality, our revenue and gross margin may
suffer.

The process of developing new high technology products and services and enhancing existing products and services is complex, costly and uncertain, and any failure
by us to anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends accurately could significantly harm our market share and results of operations. We must make long-term
investments, develop or obtain appropriate intellectual property and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will accurately reflect customer demand for our products and
services. After we develop a product, we must be able to manufacture appropriate volumes quickly and at low costs. To accomplish this, we must accurately forecast volumes, mixes of products and
configurations that meet customer requirements, and we may not succeed at all or within a given product's life cycle. Any delay in the development, production or marketing of a new product could
result in our not being among the first to market, which could further harm our competitive position.

In
the course of conducting our business, we must adequately address quality issues associated with our products and services, including defects in our engineering, design and
manufacturing processes, as


well
as defects in third-party components included in our products. In order to address quality issues, we work extensively with our customers and suppliers and engage in product testing to determine
the cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions. However, we may have limited ability to control quality issues, particularly with respect to faulty components manufactured by third
parties. If we are unable to determine the cause, find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix (or "patch"), we may delay shipment to customers, which would delay revenue recognition and
could adversely affect our revenue and reported results. Finding solutions to quality issues can be expensive and may result in additional warranty, replacement and other costs, adversely affecting
our profits. If new or existing customers have difficulty operating our products, our operating margins could be adversely affected, and we could face possible claims if we fail to meet our customers'
expectations. In addition, quality issues can impair our relationships with new or existing customers and adversely affect our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results.

If we do not effectively manage our product and services transitions, our revenue may suffer.

Many of the industries in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance and software features and functionality;
frequent introduction of new products; short product life cycles; and continual improvement in product price characteristics relative to product performance. Among the risks associated with the
introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing, variations in costs, delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing products in anticipation of
new introductions, difficulty in predicting customer demand for the new offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand, risks associated with
customer qualification and evaluation of new products and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software. If we do not make an
effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings, our revenue may decline.

Our
revenue and gross margin also may suffer due to the timing of product or service introductions by our suppliers and competitors. This is especially challenging when a product has a
short life cycle or a competitor introduces a new product just before our own product introduction. Furthermore, sales of our new products and services may replace sales, or result in discounting of
some of our current offerings, offsetting the benefit of even a successful introduction. There also may be overlaps in the current products and services of HP and portfolios acquired through mergers
and acquisitions that we must manage. In addition, it may be difficult to ensure performance of new customer contracts in accordance with our revenue, margin and cost estimates and to achieve
operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates. Given the competitive nature of our industry, if any of these risks materializes, future demand for our products and services and our results of
operations may suffer.

Our revenue, cost of sales, and expenses may suffer if we cannot continue to license or enforce the intellectual property rights on which our business depends or if third
parties assert that we violate their intellectual property rights.

We rely upon patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and similar laws in other countries, and agreements with our employees,
customers, suppliers and other parties, to establish and maintain our intellectual property rights in technology and products used in our operations. However, any of our direct or indirect
intellectual property rights could be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or such intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit us to take advantage of current market trends or
otherwise to provide competitive advantages, which could result in costly product redesign efforts, discontinuance of certain product offerings or other competitive harm. Further, the laws of certain
countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. Therefore, in certain jurisdictions we may be unable to


protect
our proprietary technology adequately against unauthorized third-party copying or use, which could adversely affect our competitive position.

Because
of the rapid pace of technological change in the information technology industry, much of our business and many of our products rely on key technologies developed or licensed by
third parties. We may not be able to obtain or to continue to obtain licenses and technologies from these third parties at all or on reasonable terms, or such third parties may demand cross-licenses
to our intellectual property. In addition, it is possible that as a consequence of a merger or acquisition transaction third parties may obtain licenses to some of our intellectual property rights or
our business may be subject to certain restrictions that were not in place prior to the transaction. Consequently, we may lose a competitive advantage with respect to these intellectual property
rights or we may be required to enter into costly arrangements in order to terminate or limit these rights.

Third
parties also may claim that we or customers indemnified by us are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. For example, in recent years, individuals and groups have
begun purchasing intellectual property assets for the sole purpose of making claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from large companies such as HP. If we cannot or do not
license the infringed technology at all or on reasonable terms or substitute similar technology from another source, our operations could suffer. Even if we believe that the claims are without merit,
the claims can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management's attention and resources away from our business. Claims of intellectual property infringement also might
require us to redesign affected products, enter into costly settlement or license agreements or pay costly damage awards, or face a temporary or permanent injunction prohibiting us from marketing or
selling certain of our products. Even if we have an agreement to indemnify us against such costs, the indemnifying party may be unable to uphold its contractual agreements to us.

Finally,
our results of operations and cash flows could be affected in certain periods and on an ongoing basis by the imposition, accrual and payment of copyright levies or similar fees.
In certain countries (primarily in Europe), proceedings are ongoing against HP seeking to impose levies upon equipment (such as PCs, multifunction devices and printers) and alleging that the copyright
owners are entitled to compensation because these devices enable reproducing copyrighted content. Other countries that do not yet have levies on these types of devices are expected to extend existing
levy schemes, and countries that do not currently have levy schemes may decide to impose copyright levies on these types of devices. If imposed, the amount of copyright levies would depend on the
types of products determined to be subject to the levy, the number of units of those products sold during the period covered by the levy and the per unit fee for each type of product, all of which may
be affected by several factors, including the outcome of ongoing litigation involving HP and other industry participants and possible action by the legislative bodies in the applicable countries, but
could be substantial. Consequently, the ultimate impact of these potential copyright levies or similar fees and the ability of HP to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.

Economic uncertainty could adversely affect our revenue, gross margin and expenses.

Our revenue and gross margin depend significantly on general economic conditions and the demand for computing and imaging products and services in the markets in
which we compete. Economic weakness and constrained IT spending has previously resulted, and may result in the future, in decreased revenue, gross margin, earnings or growth rates and problems with
our ability to manage inventory levels and collect customer receivables. We could experience such economic weakness and reduced spending, particularly in our consumer and financial services
businesses, due to increases in fuel and other energy costs, conditions in the residential real estate and mortgage markets, access to credit and other macroeconomic factors affecting spending
behavior. In addition, customer financial difficulties have previously resulted, and could result in the future, in increases in bad debt write-offs and additions to reserves in our
receivables portfolio, inability by our lessees to make required lease


payments
and reduction in the value of leased equipment upon its return to us compared to the value estimated at lease inception. We also have experienced, and may experience in the future, gross
margin declines in certain businesses, reflecting the effect of items such as competitive pricing pressures, inventory write-downs, charges associated with the cancellation of planned production line
expansion, and increases in pension and post-retirement benefit expenses. Economic downturns also may lead to restructuring actions and associated expenses. Uncertainty about future
economic conditions makes it difficult for us to forecast operating results and to make decisions about future investments. Delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a
material adverse effect on demand for our products and services, and consequently our results of operations, prospects and stock price.

Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes or other factors could harm our future revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition.

Sales outside the United States make up approximately 67% of our net revenue. Our future revenue, gross margin, expenses and financial condition also could suffer
due to a variety of international factors, including:

•

ongoing
instability or changes in a country's or region's economic or political conditions, including inflation, recession, interest rate fluctuations and actual or
anticipated military or political conflicts;

•

longer
accounts receivable cycles and financial instability among customers;

•

trade
regulations and procedures and actions affecting production, pricing and marketing of products;

•

local
labor conditions and regulations;

•

managing
a geographically dispersed workforce;

•

changes
in the regulatory or legal environment;

•

differing
technology standards or customer requirements;

•

import,
export or other business licensing requirements or requirements relating to making foreign direct investments, which could affect our ability to obtain favorable
terms for components or lead to penalties or restrictions;

•

difficulties
associated with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws; and

•

fluctuations
in freight costs and disruptions in the transportation and shipping infrastructure at important geographic points of exit and entry for our products and
shipments.

The
factors described above also could disrupt our product and component manufacturing and key suppliers located outside of the United States. For example, we rely on manufacturers in
Taiwan for the production of notebook computers and other suppliers in Asia for product assembly and manufacture.

As
approximately 67% of our sales are from countries outside of the United States, other currencies, particularly the euro and the Japanese yen, can have an impact on HP's results
(expressed in U.S. dollars). Currency variations also contribute to variations in sales of products and services in impacted jurisdictions. In addition, currency variations can adversely affect
margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the United States and margins on sales of products that include components obtained from suppliers located outside of the United States. We use
a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against foreign currency exchange rate risks. Such hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more
than a portion of


the
adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations. Gains or losses associated with hedging activities also may impact our revenue and to a lesser extent our cost of sales and financial
condition.

In
many foreign countries, particularly in those with developing economies, it is common to engage in business practices that are prohibited by laws and regulations applicable to us,
such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Although we implement policies and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with these laws, our employees, contractors and agents, as well as those
companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, may take actions in violation of our policies. Any such violation, even if prohibited by our policies, could have a material adverse
effect on our business.

Terrorist acts, conflicts and wars may seriously harm our business and revenue, costs and expenses and financial condition and stock price.

Terrorist acts, conflicts or wars (wherever located around the world) may cause damage or disruption to HP, our employees, facilities, partners, suppliers,
distributors, resellers or customers. The potential for future attacks, the national and international responses to attacks or perceived threats to national security, and other actual or potential
conflicts or wars, including the ongoing military operations in Iraq, have created many economic and political uncertainties. In addition, as a major multi-national company with headquarters and
significant operations located in the United States, actions against or by the United States may impact our business or employees. Although it is impossible to predict the occurrences or consequences
of any such events, they could result in a decrease in demand for our products, make it difficult or impossible to deliver products to our customers or to receive components from our suppliers, create
delays and inefficiencies in our supply chain and result in the need to impose employee travel restrictions. We are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts,
conflicts and wars.

Business disruptions could seriously harm our future revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses.

Our worldwide operations could be subject to earthquakes, power shortages, telecommunications failures, water shortages, tsunamis, floods, hurricanes, typhoons,
fires, extreme weather conditions, medical epidemics and other natural or manmade disasters or business interruptions, for which we are predominantly self-insured. The occurrence of any of
these business disruptions could seriously harm our revenue and financial condition and increase our costs and expenses. Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development
activities, are located in California, and other critical business operations and some of our suppliers are located in California and Asia, near major earthquake faults. The ultimate impact on us, our
significant suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults is unknown, but our revenue, profitability and financial condition could suffer in the event of a
major earthquake or other natural disaster. In addition, some areas, including California and parts of the East Coast, Southwest and Midwest of the United States, have previously experienced, and may
experience in the future, major power shortages and blackouts. These blackouts could cause disruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, distributors and resellers, or customers.
Moreover, the consolidation of all of our worldwide IT data centers into six centers located in the southern United States, when completed, could increase the impact on us of a natural disaster or
other business disruption occurring in that geographic area.

If we fail to manage the distribution of our products and services properly, our revenue, gross margin and profitability could suffer.

We use a variety of different distribution methods to sell our products and services, including third-party resellers and distributors and both direct and
indirect sales to both enterprise accounts and consumers. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect channel efforts to reach various potential customer segments for our products
and services is a complex process. Moreover, since each distribution method has distinct risks and gross margins, our failure to implement the most


advantageous
balance in the delivery model for our products and services could adversely affect our revenue and gross margins and therefore our profitability. Other distribution risks are described
below.

•

Our
financial results could be materially adversely affected due to channel conflicts or if the financial conditions of our channel partners were to weaken.

Our
future operating results may be adversely affected by any conflicts that might arise between our various sales channels, the loss or deterioration of any alliance or distribution arrangement or
the loss of retail shelf space. Moreover, some of our wholesale and retail distributors may have insufficient financial resources and may not be able to withstand changes in business conditions,
including economic weakness and industry consolidation. Many of our significant distributors operate on narrow product margins and have been negatively affected by business pressures. Considerable
trade receivables that are not covered by collateral or credit insurance are outstanding with our distribution and retail channel partners. Revenue from indirect sales could suffer, and we could
experience disruptions in distribution if our distributors' financial conditions, abilities to borrow funds in the credit markets or operations weaken.

•

Our
inventory management is complex as we continue to sell a significant mix of products through distributors.

We
must manage inventory effectively, particularly with respect to sales to distributors, which involves forecasting demand and pricing issues. Distributors may increase orders during periods of
product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high or delay orders in anticipation of new products. Distributors also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and
the products of our competitors and seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our reliance upon
indirect distribution methods may reduce visibility to demand and pricing issues, and therefore make forecasting more difficult. If we have excess or obsolete inventory, we may have to reduce our
prices and write down inventory. Moreover, our use of indirect distribution channels may limit our willingness or ability to adjust prices quickly and otherwise to respond to pricing changes by
competitors. We also may have limited ability to estimate future product rebate redemptions in order to price our products effectively.

We depend on third-party suppliers, and our revenue and gross margin could suffer if we fail to manage suppliers properly.

Our operations depend on our ability to anticipate our needs for components, products and services and our suppliers' ability to deliver sufficient quantities of
quality components, products and services at reasonable prices in time for us to meet critical schedules. Given the wide variety of systems, products and services that we offer, the large number of
our suppliers and contract manufacturers that are dispersed across the globe, and the long lead times that are required to manufacture, assemble and deliver certain components and products, problems
could arise in planning production and managing inventory levels that could seriously harm us. Other supplier problems that we could face include component shortages, excess supply, risks related to
the terms of our contracts with suppliers, risks associated with contingent workers, and risks related to our relationships with single source suppliers, as described below.

•

Shortages.

Occasionally we may experience a shortage of, or a delay in receiving, certain supplies as a result of strong
demand, capacity constraints, supplier financial weaknesses, inability of suppliers to borrow funds in the credit markets, disputes with suppliers (some of which are also customers), other problems
experienced by suppliers or problems faced during the transition to new suppliers. In particular, our PC business relies heavily upon Contract Manufacturers ("CMs") and Original Design Manufacturers
("ODMs") to manufacture its products and is


therefore
dependent upon the continuing operations of those CMs and ODMs to fulfill demand for our PC products. HP represents a substantial portion of the business of some of these CMs and ODMs, and
any changes to the nature or volume of business transacted by HP with a particular CM or ODM could adversely affect the operations and financial condition of the CM or ODM and lead to shortages or
delays in receiving products from that CM or ODM. If shortages or delays persist, the price of these supplies may increase, we may be exposed to quality issues or the supplies may not be available at
all. We may not be able to secure enough supplies at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build products or provide services in a timely manner in the quantities or according to the
specifications needed. Accordingly, our revenue and gross margin could suffer as we could lose time-sensitive sales, incur additional freight costs or be unable to pass on price increases
to our customers. If we cannot adequately address supply issues, we might have to reengineer some products or service offerings, resulting in further costs and delays.

•

Oversupply.

In order to secure supplies for the provision of products or services, at times we may make advance payments to
suppliers or enter into non-cancelable commitments with vendors. In addition, we may purchase supplies strategically in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to
address concerns about the availability of future supplies. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could
adversely affect our gross margin.

•

Contractual terms.

As a result of binding price or purchase commitments with vendors, we may be obligated to purchase
supplies or services at prices that are higher than those available in the current market and be limited in our ability to respond to changing market conditions. In the event that we become committed
to purchase supplies or services for prices in excess of the current market price, we may be at a disadvantage to competitors who have access to components or services at lower prices, and our gross
margin could suffer. In addition, many of our competitors obtain products or components from the same CMs, ODMs and suppliers that we utilize. Our competitors may obtain better pricing and other terms
and more favorable allocations of products and components during periods of limited supply, and our ability to engage in relationships with certain CMs, ODMs and suppliers could be limited. The
practice employed by our PC business of purchasing product components and transferring those components to its CMs and ODMs may create large supplier receivables with the CMs and ODMs that, depending
on the financial condition of the CMs and ODMs, may have a risk of uncollectibility. In addition, certain of our CMs, ODMs and suppliers may decide in the future to discontinue conducting
business with us. Any of these actions by our competitors, CMs, ODMs or suppliers could adversely affect our future operating results and financial condition.

•

Contingent workers.

We also rely on third-party suppliers for the provision of contingent workers, and our failure to manage
our use of such workers effectively could adversely affect our results of operations. We have been exposed to various legal claims relating to the status of contingent workers in the past and could
face similar claims in the future. We may be subject to shortages, oversupply or fixed contractual terms relating to contingent workers, as described above. Our ability to manage the size of, and
costs associated with, the contingent workforce may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws.

•

Single source suppliers.

Our use of single source suppliers for certain components could exacerbate our supplier issues. We
obtain a significant number of components from single sources due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. For example, we rely on Intel to provide us with a sufficient
supply of processors for many of our PCs, workstations, handheld computing devices and servers, and some of those processors are customized for our products. New products that we introduce may utilize
custom components obtained from only one source initially until we have evaluated whether there is a need for


additional
suppliers. Replacing a single source supplier could delay production of some products as replacement suppliers initially may be subject to capacity constraints or other output limitations.
For some components, such as customized components and some of the processors that we obtain from Intel, alternative sources may not exist or those alternative sources may be unable to produce the
quantities of those components necessary to satisfy our production requirements. In addition, we sometimes purchase components from single source suppliers under short-term agreements that
contain favorable pricing and other terms but that may be unilaterally modified or terminated by the supplier with limited notice and with little or no penalty. The performance of such single source
suppliers under those agreements (and the renewal or extension of those agreements upon similar terms) may affect the quality, quantity and price of supplies to HP. The loss of a single source
supplier, the deterioration of our relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which we are supplied components by a single source
supplier could adversely effect our revenue and gross margins.

If we fail to comply with our customer contracts or government contracting regulations, our revenue could suffer.

Our
contracts with our customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, our contracts with federal, state, provincial and local governmental
customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions and other requirements relating to their formation, administration and performance. Any failure by us to comply with the
specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include
termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments and, in the case of our government contracts, fines and suspension from future government contracting. In addition, we are
currently, and in the future may be, subject to

qui tam

litigation brought by private individuals on behalf of the government relating to our government
contracts, which could include claims for up to treble damages. Further, any negative publicity related to our customer contracts or any proceedings surrounding them, regardless of its accuracy, may
damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. If our customer contracts are terminated, if we are suspended from government work, or if our ability to compete for new
contracts is adversely affected, we could suffer a material reduction in expected revenue.

The revenue and profitability of our operations have historically varied, which makes our future financial results less predictable.

Our revenue, gross margin and profit vary among our products and services, customer groups and geographic markets and therefore will likely be different in future
periods than our current results. Overall gross margins and profitability in any given period are dependent partially on the product, customer and geographic mix reflected in that period's net
revenue. In particular, IPG and certain of its business units such as printer supplies contribute significantly to our gross margin and profitability. Competition, lawsuits, investigations and other
risks affecting IPG, therefore may have a significant impact on our overall gross margin and profitability. Certain segments, and ESS in particular, have a higher fixed cost structure and more
variation in gross margins across their business units and product portfolios than others and may therefore experience significant operating profit volatility on a quarterly basis. In addition, newer
geographic markets may be relatively less profitable due to investments associated with entering those markets and local pricing pressures, and we may have difficulty establishing and maintaining the
operating infrastructure necessary to support the high growth rate associated with some of those markets. Market trends, competitive pressures, commoditization of products, seasonal rebates, increased
component or shipping costs, regulatory impacts and other factors may result in reductions in revenue or pressure on gross margins of certain segments in a given period, which may necessitate
adjustments to our operations.


We make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of HP's Consolidated Financial Statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations.

In connection with the preparation of HP's Consolidated Financial Statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other
factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this report. In addition, as discussed in
Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we make certain estimates under the provisions of SFAS No. 5 "Accounting for Contingencies," including decisions related to provisions
for legal proceedings and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of
which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Unanticipated changes in HP's tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Our tax liabilities are affected by the amounts we charge for inventory,
services, licenses, funding and other items in intercompany transactions. We are subject to ongoing tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges or
other matters and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, there can be no assurance
that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits, and the actual outcomes of these audits could have a material impact on our net income or financial condition. In addition, our effective
tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities,
changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. In particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the
United States, is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the United States. Any of these changes could affect our profitability.

Our sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less predictable.

In some of our segments, our quarterly sales often have reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of each quarter's total sales occur towards the
end of such quarter. This uneven sales pattern makes prediction of revenue, earnings, cash flow from operations and working capital for each financial period difficult, increases the risk of
unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition and places pressure on our inventory management and logistics systems. If predicted demand is substantially greater than orders,
there will be excess inventory. Alternatively, if orders substantially exceed predicted demand, we may not be able to fulfill all of the orders received in the last few weeks of each quarter. Other
developments late in a quarter, such as a systems failure, component pricing movements, component shortages or global logistics disruptions, could adversely impact inventory levels and results of
operations in a manner that is disproportionate to the number of days in the quarter affected.

We
experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products that also may produce variations in quarterly results and financial condition. For example, sales to governments
(particularly sales to the United States government) are often stronger in the third calendar quarter, consumer sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter, and many customers whose fiscal
and calendar years are the same spend their remaining capital budget authorizations in the fourth calendar quarter prior to new budget constraints in the first calendar quarter of the following year.
European sales are often weaker during the summer months. Demand during the spring and early summer also may be adversely


impacted
by market anticipation of seasonal trends. Moreover, to the extent that we introduce new products in anticipation of seasonal demand trends, our discounting of existing products may adversely
affect our gross margin prior to or shortly after such product launches. Typically, our third fiscal quarter is our weakest and our fourth fiscal quarter is our strongest. Many of the factors that
create and affect seasonal trends are beyond our control.

Any failure by us to execute planned cost reductions successfully could result in total costs and expenses that are greater than expected.

We have adopted restructuring and other cost reduction plans to bring operational expenses to appropriate levels for each of our businesses, while simultaneously
implementing extensive new company-wide expense control programs. These initiatives include:

•

A
workforce restructuring program and a related U.S. early retirement program announced in July 2005 that we expect to result in the elimination of approximately
14,985 positions by the end of fiscal 2008;

•

A
multi-year plan announced in the third fiscal quarter of 2006 to reduce IT spending by consolidating HP's 85 data centers worldwide into six larger centers
located in three U.S. cities;

•

A
multi-year program announced in the third fiscal quarter of 2006 to reduce real estate costs by consolidating several hundred HP real estate locations
worldwide to fewer core sites;

•

Modifications
to our defined benefit pension plan, our subsidized retiree medical program and our 401(k) plan announced in February 2007 pursuant to which affected
employees will cease accruing pension benefits and will, instead, receive an increased 401(k) match effective January 1, 2008; and

•

A
U.S. early retirement program announced in February 2007 under which 3,080 employees left the company as of May 31, 2007, all of whom have been or we expect
will be replaced.

Our
ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from these initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions, including
estimates and assumptions regarding the cost of consolidating the data centers and real estate locations, the amount of accelerated depreciation or asset impairment to be incurred when we vacate
facilities or cease using equipment before the end of their respective lease term or asset life, the savings associated with the benefit plan changes announced in February 2007, the costs
associated with the replacement of employees who retired under the February 2007 early retirement program and the costs and timing of other activities in connection with these initiatives.
These estimates and assumptions are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we
experience delays, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate key employees, and failure to do so could seriously harm us.

In order to be successful, we must attract, retain and motivate executives and other key employees, including those in managerial, technical, sales, marketing and
IT support positions. Hiring and retaining qualified executives, engineers, skilled solutions providers in the IT support business and qualified sales representatives are critical to our future, and
competition for experienced employees in the IT industry can be intense. The failure to hire executives and key employees or the loss of executives and key employees could have a significant impact on
our operations.


Changes to our compensation and benefit programs could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain employees.

We have historically used stock options and other forms of share-based payment awards as key components of our total rewards employee compensation program in
order to align employees' interests with the interests of our stockholders, encourage employee retention and provide competitive compensation and benefit packages. HP began recording charges to
earnings for stock-based compensation expense in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment."
As a result, we began to incur increased compensation costs associated with our stock-based compensation programs. Moreover, difficulties relating to obtaining stockholder approval of equity
compensation plans could make it harder or more expensive for us to grant share-based payment awards to employees in the future. Like other companies, HP has reviewed its equity compensation strategy
in light of the current regulatory and competitive environment and has reduced the total number of share-based payment awards granted to employees and the number of employees who receive share-based
payment awards. Due to this change in our stock-based compensation strategy, combined with the pension and other benefit plan changes undertaken to reduce costs and our increasing reliance on variable
pay, we may find it difficult to attract, retain and motivate employees, and any such difficulty could materially adversely affect our business.

HP's stock price has historically fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of HP's stock difficult to predict.

HP's stock price, like that of other technology companies, can be volatile. Some of the factors that could affect our stock price are:

•

speculation
in the press or investment community about, or actual changes in, our business, strategic position, market share, organizational structure, operations, financial
condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost cutting efforts, value or liquidity of our investments, exposure to market volatility, prospects, business combination or investment
transactions, or executive team;

•

the
announcement of new products, services, technological innovations or acquisitions by HP or its competitors; and

•

quarterly
increases or decreases in revenue, gross margin, earnings or cash flow from operations, changes in estimates by the investment community or guidance provided by
HP, and variations between actual and estimated financial results.

General
or industry-specific market conditions or stock market performance or domestic or international macroeconomic and geopolitical factors unrelated to HP's performance also may
affect the price of HP common stock. For these reasons, investors should not rely on recent trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In
addition, following periods of volatility in a company's securities, securities class action litigation against a company is sometimes instituted. If instituted against HP, this type of litigation
could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management time and resources.

System security risks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers, and any such disruption
could harm our revenue, increase our expenses and harm our reputation and stock price.

Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third
parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. In addition, computer programmers and hackers may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack
our products or otherwise exploit


any
security vulnerabilities of our products. As a result, we could incur significant expenses in addressing problems created by security breaches of our network and any security vulnerabilities of
our products. Moreover, we could lose existing or potential customers for information technology outsourcing services or other information technology solutions or incur significant expenses in
connection with our customers' system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications
that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including "bugs" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The
costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems
could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions.

Portions
of our IT infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes
place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, including our current project to consolidate all of our worldwide IT data centers into six
centers, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and
interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins or lost customers resulting from these disruptions have adversely affected in the past, and in the future could adversely affect, our financial
results, stock price and reputation.

Any failure by us to manage, complete and integrate acquisitions, divestitures and other significant transactions successfully could harm our financial results, business and
prospects and may result in financial results that are different than expected.

As part of our business strategy, we frequently acquire complementary companies or businesses, divest non-core businesses or assets, enter into
strategic alliances and joint ventures and make investments to further our business (collectively, "business combination and investment transactions"). In order to pursue this strategy successfully,
we must identify suitable candidates for and successfully complete business combination and investment transactions, some of which may be large and complex,
and manage post-closing issues such as the integration of acquired companies or employees. Integration and other risks associated with business combination and investment transactions can
be more pronounced for larger and more complicated transactions or if multiple transactions are integrated simultaneously. If we fail to identify and complete successfully business combination and
investment transactions that further our strategic objectives, we may be required to expend resources to develop products and technology internally, we may be at a competitive disadvantage or we may
be adversely affected by negative market perceptions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our revenue, gross margin and profitability.

Integration
issues are complex, time-consuming and expensive and, without proper planning and implementation, could significantly disrupt our business. The challenges
involved in integration include:

•

combining
product offerings and entering into new markets in which we are not experienced;

•

convincing
customers and distributors that the transaction will not diminish client service standards or business focus, preventing customers and distributors from deferring
purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers (which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty), minimizing sales force attrition and
coordinating sales, marketing and distribution efforts;

•

consolidating
and rationalizing corporate IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various acquisitions and integrating software code;


•

minimizing
the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns;

•

persuading
employees that business cultures are compatible, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, engaging with employee works councils representing an
acquired company's non-U.S. employees, integrating employees into HP, correctly estimating employee benefit costs and implementing restructuring programs;

•

coordinating
and combining administrative, manufacturing, research and development and other operations, subsidiaries, facilities and relationships with third parties in
accordance with local laws and other obligations while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures;

•

achieving
savings from supply chain integration; and

•

managing
integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent transactions.

We
evaluate and enter into significant business combination and investment transactions on an ongoing basis. We may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any business
combination and investment transaction, and the timeframe for achieving benefits of a business combination and investment transaction may depend partially upon the actions of employees, suppliers or
other third parties. In addition, the pricing and other terms of our contracts for business combination and investment transactions require us to make estimates and assumptions at the time we enter
into these contracts, and, during the course of our due diligence, we may not identify all of the factors necessary to estimate our costs accurately. Any increased or unexpected costs, unanticipated
delays or failure to achieve contractual obligations could make these agreements less profitable or unprofitable.

Managing
business combination and investment transactions requires varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. These business
combination and investment transactions also have resulted and in the future may result in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings, including those related to severance pay, early
retirement costs, employee benefit costs, asset impairment charges, charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts, in-process research and development charges,
inventory adjustments, assumed litigation and other liabilities, legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans.
Moreover, HP has incurred and will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain assets acquired in connection with business combination and investment
transactions, and, to the extent that the value of goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives acquired in connection with a business combination and investment transaction becomes impaired,
we may be required to incur additional material charges relating to the impairment of those assets. In order to complete an acquisition, we may issue common stock, potentially creating dilution for
existing stockholders, or borrow, affecting our financial condition and potentially our credit ratings. Any prior or future downgrades in our credit rating associated with an acquisition could
adversely affect our ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms. In addition, HP's effective tax rate on an ongoing basis is uncertain, and business combination and investment
transactions could impact our effective tax rate. We also may experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a business combination and investment transaction and the risk that an
announced business combination and investment transaction may not close. As a result, any completed, pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment
community's expectations in a given quarter.


We cannot predict the outcome of various regulatory inquiries and stockholder derivative action lawsuits arising out of the processes employed in the investigation into leaks
of HP confidential information to members of the media, and we may be named in additional regulatory inquiries and stockholder litigation, all of which could result in significant legal and other
expenses.

The Attorney General of the State of California, the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern
District of California, the Division of Enforcement of the SEC and the U.S. Federal Communications Commission all have conducted inquiries or investigations relating to the processes employed in an
investigation into leaks of HP confidential information to members of the media that concluded in May 2006. We have entered into an agreement with the California Attorney General to resolve
civil claims relating to the leak investigation. Under the terms of the agreement, which includes an injunction, we have paid a total of $14.5 million and agreed to implement and maintain for
five years a series of measures designed to ensure that HP's corporate investigations are conducted in accordance with California law and the company's high ethical standards. We also have consented
to the entry of an order by the SEC ordering HP to cease and desist from committing or causing violations of the public reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. If we
fail to implement and maintain the measures required under the agreement with the California Attorney General or if we fail to comply with the SEC cease and desist order, we could be subject to civil
or criminal penalties.

Four
stockholder derivative lawsuits also have been filed in California (all of which have been consolidated into a single lawsuit) and two in Delaware (both of which have been
consolidated into a single lawsuit) purportedly on behalf of HP stockholders seeking to recover damages and to obtain specified injunctive relief stemming from the activities of the leak
investigations. We may in the future also be subject to additional litigation or other proceedings arising in relation to these matters. The period of time necessary to resolve the stockholder
lawsuits is uncertain, and the expense of defending and concluding such litigation may be significant. In addition, we may be obligated to indemnify (and advance legal expenses to) former or current
directors, officers or employees in accordance with the terms of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws, other applicable agreements, and Delaware law.

Unforeseen environmental costs could impact our future net earnings.

We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, such as laws governing the conduct of our
facilities and operations with respect to the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. It
is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental clean-up to sites outside the United States, even where we are not required to do so under applicable local laws and regulations.
Many of our products are subject to various federal, state and international laws governing chemical substances, including laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances and
laws restricting the presence of certain substances in electronics products. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, third-party property
damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be enjoined from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or if our products become
non-compliant with environmental laws. The ultimate costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict, and liability under some environmental laws
relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis. We record a liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs when we consider the
costs to be probable and the amount of the costs can be reasonably estimated. We face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future requirements
relating to the materials composition of our products, including the restrictions on lead, cadmium and certain other substances that apply to specified electronics products put on the market in the
European Union as of July 1, 2006 (Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive) and


similar
legislation in other countries including China, Japan and Korea. We also could face significant costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. The EU has
enacted the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the "WEEE Legislation"), which makes producers of electrical goods, including computers and printers, financially responsible for
specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States,
Canada, Mexico, China and Japan. We are continuing to evaluate the cumulative impact of, and are taking steps to comply with, the WEEE Legislation and similar legislation in other jurisdictions as
individual countries issue their implementation legislation and guidance.

Some anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.

We have provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, each of which could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition
of HP deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. These include provisions:

•

authorizing
blank check preferred stock, which HP could issue with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;

•

limiting
the liability of, and providing indemnification to, HP's directors and officers;

•

specifying
that HP stockholders may take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders and otherwise in accordance with our bylaws and limiting the
ability of our stockholders to call special meetings;

•

requiring
advance notice of proposals by HP stockholders for business to be conducted at stockholder meetings and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board of
Directors;

•

requiring
a vote by the holders of two-thirds of HP's outstanding shares to amend certain bylaws relating to HP stockholder meetings, the Board of Directors and
indemnification; and

•

controlling
the procedures for conduct of HP Board and stockholder meetings and election, appointment and removal of HP directors.

These
provisions, alone or together, could deter or delay hostile takeovers, proxy contests and changes in control or management of HP. As a Delaware corporation, HP also is subject to
provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some
stockholders from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of HP's outstanding common stock.

Any
provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control of HP could limit the opportunity for our
stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of HP common stock and also could affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for HP common stock.

ITEM 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments.

ITEM 2. Properties.

As of October 31, 2007, we owned or leased a total of approximately 62 million square feet of space worldwide. We believe that our existing
properties are in good condition and are suitable for the conduct of our business.


As
of October 31, 2007, our sales and support operations occupied approximately 12 million square feet. We own 42% of the space used for sales and support activities and
lease the remaining 58%.

Our
manufacturing plants, research and development facilities and warehouse and administrative facilities occupied approximately 50 million square feet. We own 57% of our
manufacturing, research and development, warehouse and administrative space and lease the remaining 43%. Our plants are equipped with machinery, most of which we own and which, in part, we developed
to meet the special requirements of our manufacturing processes. At the end of fiscal 2007, we were productively utilizing the majority of the space in our facilities, while executing our previously
announced plans to consolidate our 85 data centers into six larger centers and to reduce our real estate costs and increase our productive utilization by consolidating several hundred real estate
locations worldwide to fewer core sites over the next three years.

As
indicated above, we have seven business segments: ESS, HPS, HP Software, PSG, IPG, HPFS, and Corporate Investments. Because of the interrelation of these segments, a majority of these
segments use substantially all of the properties at least in part, and we retain the flexibility to use each of the properties in whole or in part for each of the segments.

HP
repurchased shares in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 under an ongoing program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans as well as to repurchase
shares opportunistically. This program, which does not have a specific expiration date, authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. All shares repurchased in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2007 were purchased in open market transactions.

As
of October 31, 2007, HP had remaining authorization of approximately $2.7 billion for future share repurchases under the $8.0 billion repurchase authorization
approved by HP's Board of Directors on March 15, 2007.

On
November 19, 2007, HP's Board of Directors authorized an additional $8.0 billion for future repurchases of HP's outstanding shares of common stock.

ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Management's Discussion and Analysis of

Financial Condition and Results of Operations

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes that appear
elsewhere in this document.

OVERVIEW

We are a leading global provider of products, technologies, software, solutions and services to individual consumers, small- and medium-sized businesses ("SMBs"),
and large enterprises, including in the public and education sectors. Our offerings span:

•

personal
computing and other access devices;

•

imaging
and printing-related products and services;

•

enterprise
information technology infrastructure, including enterprise storage and server technology, and software that optimizes business technology investments; and

•

multi-vendor
customer services, including technology support and maintenance, consulting and integration and outsourcing services.

We
have seven business segments: Enterprise Storage and Servers ("ESS"), HP Services ("HPS"), HP Software, the Personal Systems Group ("PSG"), the Imaging and Printing Group ("IPG"), HP
Financial Services ("HPFS"), and Corporate Investments. ESS, HPS and HP Software are structured beneath a broader Technology Solutions Group ("TSG"). While TSG is not an operating segment, we
sometimes provide financial data aggregating the segments within TSG in order to provide a supplementary view of our business.

The
operating framework in which we manage our businesses and guide our strategies is based on the disciplined management of three business levers: targeted growth, operational
efficiency and capital strategy. Although we have made progress towards our goals in recent periods, there are still many areas in which we believe that we can improve. To implement this operating
framework, we are focused on the following initiatives:

•

We
are engaged in a process of examining every function and every business in the company in order to optimize efficiency and reduce cost;

•

We
are in the process of consolidating 85 data centers worldwide into six state-of-the-art centers in three U.S. cities and consolidating
several hundred real estate locations worldwide to fewer core sites in order to reduce our IT spending and real estate costs;

•

We
are reinvesting a portion of the cost savings from these initiatives by expanding our sales force and aligning our resources in order to build our market share in
emerging markets while expanding our coverage to drive growth in mature markets;

•

We
are developing training programs for our sales forces designed to enhance our ability to provide solutions to our customers and build customer loyalty;

•

We
are building and expanding our services organization to support our technology businesses and provide comprehensive solutions to our customers;

•

We
are developing a global delivery structure to take advantage of regions where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs;


•

We
are expanding our ethics and compliance programs and enhancing our corporate governance to ensure that all of our actions are consistent with HP's values; and

•

We
are repurchasing shares of our common stock under an ongoing program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee stock plans as well as to repurchase
shares opportunistically.

We
continue to grow our business organically and through strategic acquisitions. During fiscal 2007, we acquired ten companies, among which the two largest were Mercury Interactive
Corporation ("Mercury") and Opsware Inc., and we expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions periodically in the future.

In
February 2007, we announced our decision to modify our U.S. defined benefit pension plan for the remaining number of U.S. employees still accruing benefits under the program.
Effective January 1, 2008, these employees will cease accruing pension benefits and will, instead, receive an increased 401(k) match to 6 percent from 4 percent of eligible
earnings. The final pension benefit amount will be calculated based on pay and service through December 31, 2007. In addition, future eligibility for the Pre-2003 HP Retiree Medical
Program was limited to those employees who were within five years of satisfying the program's eligibility criteria on June 30, 2007. These actions reduced our U.S. defined benefit and
post-retirement plan obligations, and, as a result, we recorded a one-time curtailment gain of $542 million in fiscal 2007. In conjunction with this announcement, we
provided eligible affected employees with the opportunity to participate in a 2007 U.S. Enhanced Early Retirement program (the "2007 EER") and recorded a restructuring charge of $354 million
during fiscal 2007. A total of 3,080 employees participated in the 2007 EER, including 595 persons who had been included in previous restructuring programs or who voluntarily left the company since
November 30, 2006. All employees who participated in the 2007 EER left the company by May 31,
2007. For more information, see Notes 8 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Cash
and cash equivalents at October 31, 2007 totaled $11.3 billion, a decrease of $5.1 billion from the October 31, 2006 balance of
$16.4 billion. The decrease for fiscal 2007 was related primarily to $10.9 billion paid to repurchase our common stock, $6.8 billion of net cash paid for business acquisitions and
$2.5 billion net investments in property, plant and equipment, all of which were


partially
offset by $9.6 billion in cash provided from operations, $3.1 billion in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee stock plans and a $2.6 billion net
increase in our debt and commercial paper.

We
intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our Consolidated Financial Statements,
the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles, policies and
estimates affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
discussion of results of operations at the consolidated level is followed by a more detailed discussion of results of operations by segment.

For
a further discussion of factors that could impact operating results, see the section entitled "Risk Factors" in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

General

The Consolidated Financial Statements of HP are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make
estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its
estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the
carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit
Committee of HP's Board of Directors. Management believes that the accounting estimates employed and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, actual results may differ from these estimates
under different assumptions or conditions.

An
accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is
made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes
the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Revenue Recognition

We enter into contracts to sell our products and services, and, while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions, there are
agreements that contain multiple elements or non-standard terms and conditions. As a result, significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate
accounting, including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes, and, if so, how the price
should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element. We recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered elements have standalone value, fair values
of undelivered elements are known, uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved and there are no customer-negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered
elements. Changes in the allocation of the sales price


between
elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract.

We
recognize revenue as work progresses on certain fixed-price contracts, such as consulting arrangements. Using a proportional performance method, we estimate the total expected labor
costs in order to determine the amount of revenue earned to date. We follow this basis because reasonably dependable estimates of the labor costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be
made. Total contract profit is subject to revisions throughout the life of the contract. We record changes in revenue as a result of revisions to cost estimates to income in the period in which the
facts that give rise to the revision become known.

We
record estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings, including price protection, promotions, other volume-based incentives and
expected returns. Future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take actions to increase customer incentive offerings, possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at
the time the incentive is offered. Additionally, certain incentive programs require us to estimate, based on historical experience, the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive.

Restructuring

We have engaged, and may continue to engage, in restructuring actions, which require management to utilize significant estimates related to expenses for severance
and other employee separation costs, realizable values of assets made redundant or obsolete, lease cancellation and other exit costs. If the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of the
restructuring charges could be materially impacted. For a full description of our restructuring actions, refer to our discussions of restructuring in the Results of Operations section and
Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Stock-Based Compensation Expense

Effective November 1, 2005, we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 123
(revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment" ("SFAS 123R"), using the modified prospective transition method, and therefore have not restated prior periods' results. Under this method, we recognize
stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted after November 1, 2005 and granted prior to but not yet vested as of November 1, 2005, in accordance with
SFAS 123R. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, we recognize stock-based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost for
only those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. Prior to SFAS 123R adoption, we accounted for share-based payment awards
under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25") and, accordingly, generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options
with a discounted exercise price.

Determining
the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share-based payment awards require subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the share-based
payment awards and stock price volatility. Management determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on HP common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and
future stock price trends than historical volatility. Therefore, expected volatility in fiscal years 2007, 2006 and 2005 was based on a market-based implied volatility. The assumptions used in
calculating the fair value of


share-based
payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we
use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense
only for those shares expected to vest. If our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the stock-based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have
recorded in the current period. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 for a further discussion on stock-based compensation.

Taxes on Earnings

We calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax
returns filed during the subsequent year. We record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them, which is generally in the third and fourth quarters of the subsequent
year for U.S. federal and state provisions, respectively.

We
recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts
using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely
than not to realize. We have considered future market growth, forecasted earnings, future taxable income, the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax
planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future,
we would increase the valuation allowance and make a corresponding charge to earnings in the period in which we make such determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than
not to realize the net deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets we must be able
to generate sufficient taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.

Our
effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which we have not provided U.S. taxes because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely
outside the United States. We plan foreign earnings remittance amounts based on projected cash flow needs as well as the
working capital and long-term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations. Based on these assumptions, we estimate the amount we will distribute to the United
States and provide the U.S. federal taxes due on these amounts. Further, as a result of certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing activities in
certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes, for fiscal years through 2019. Material changes in our estimates of cash, working capital and
long-term investment requirements in the various jurisdictions in which we do business could impact our effective tax rate.

We
are subject to income taxes in the United States and over sixty foreign countries, and we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe
that our tax return positions are fully supported, but tax authorities are likely to challenge certain positions, which may not be fully sustained. However, our income tax expense includes amounts
intended to satisfy income tax assessments that result from these challenges. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments and recording the related assets and liabilities
requires significant management judgments and estimates. We evaluate our income tax contingencies in accordance with SFAS No. 5,


"Accounting
for Contingencies." We believe that our reserve for income tax liabilities, including related interest, is adequate in relation to the potential for additional tax assessments. The amounts
ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision,
net income and cash flows. Our reserve for income tax liabilities is attributable primarily to uncertainties concerning the tax treatment of our international operations, including the allocation of
income among different jurisdictions, and related interest. We review our reserves quarterly, and we may adjust such reserves because of proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and
circumstances, issuance of new regulations or new case law, previously unavailable information obtained during the course of an examination, negotiations between tax authorities of different countries
concerning our transfer prices, execution of Advanced Pricing Agreements, resolution with respect to individual audit issues, the resolution of entire audits, or the expiration of statutes of
limitations. Material adjustments are most likely to occur in the fiscal years in which major ongoing audits, such as audits by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), are closed. In addition, our tax
contingency reserve includes certain amounts for potential tax assessments for pre-acquisition tax years of acquired companies which, if released, will impact the carrying value of goodwill
attributable to the acquired company.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We determine our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors to ensure that we have not overstated our trade and financing receivables balances
due to uncollectibility. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for all customers based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, trends in overall
weighted-average risk rating of the total portfolio, macroeconomic conditions, significant one-time events, historical experience and the use of third-party credit risk models that
generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors, and the financial condition of customers. Also, we record specific provisions for individual accounts when we become
aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations to
us, such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position. If circumstances related to customers change, we would further adjust our
estimates of the recoverability of receivables either upward or downward. The annual provision for doubtful accounts has averaged approximately 0.01% of net revenue over the last three fiscal years.
Using our third-party credit risk model at October 31, 2007, a 50-basis-point deterioration in the weighted-average default probabilities of our significant customers would have
resulted in an approximately $84 million increase to our trade allowance at the end of fiscal year 2007.

Inventory

We state our inventory at the lower of cost or market. We make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, at the
product group level for estimated excess, obsolescence or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in demand, rapid technological changes, product life cycle and
development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration and quality issues. Revisions to these adjustments would be required if these factors differ from our estimates.

Valuation of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets

We review goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value of an asset may not be


recoverable
in accordance with SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets." The provisions of SFAS No. 142 require that we perform a two-step impairment test on
goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 18 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We determine the fair value of our reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair
value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for
comparable companies. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further
testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to
determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the
difference. SFAS No. 142 also requires that the fair value of the purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and compared to the carrying value. We estimate the fair value
of these intangible assets using an income approach. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value.

Determining
the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions.
These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates,
future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and
inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from those estimates. In addition, we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the
carrying values for each of our reporting units.

Our
annual goodwill impairment analysis, which we performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, did not result in an impairment charge. The excess of fair value over carrying value
for each of HP's reporting units as of August 1, 2007, the annual testing date, ranged from approximately $520 million to approximately $46 billion. In order to evaluate the
sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 10% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 10% decrease would
result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $360 million to approximately $41 billion for each of HP's reporting units.

Warranty Provision

We provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time we recognize revenue. We evaluate our warranty obligations on a product group basis. Our
standard product warranty terms generally include post-sales support and repairs or replacement of a product at no additional charge for a specified period of time. While we engage in
extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers, we base our estimated warranty obligation upon warranty terms,
ongoing product failure rates, repair costs, product call rates, average cost per call, and current period product shipments. If actual product failure rates, repair rates, service delivery costs or
post-sales support costs differ from our estimates, we would be required to make revisions to the estimated warranty liability. Warranty terms generally range from


90 days
to three years parts and labor, depending upon the product. Over the last three fiscal years, the annual warranty provision has averaged approximately 3.4% of annual net product
revenue, while actual annual warranty costs have averaged approximately 3.2% of annual net product revenue.

Retirement Benefits

Our pension and other post-retirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on various assumptions. Our major assumptions relate primarily to
discount rates, salary growth, long-term return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates. We base the discount rate assumption on current investment yields of high quality fixed income
investments during the retirement benefits maturity period. The salary growth assumptions reflect our long-term actual experience and future and near-term outlook.
Long-term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management's expectation of the future economic environment, as well as target asset allocations. In
the beginning of fiscal 2008, we implemented a liability-driven investment strategy for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which will be frozen by December 31, 2007 and is currently
overfunded. As part of the strategy, we have transitioned our equity allocation to predominantly fixed income assets. The expected return on the plan assets, used in calculating the net benefit cost,
has been reduced from 8.3% to 6.3% for fiscal 2008 to reflect the changes in our asset allocation policy. Our medical cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data, the
near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. Actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and are amortized generally over the estimated
future working life of the plan participants.

Our
major assumptions vary by plan and the weighted-average rates used are set forth in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by
reference. Each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics, and, in general, changes, if any, have moved in the same direction over the last several years. For fiscal 2007, changes in the
weighted-average rates would have had the following impact on our net periodic benefit cost:

•

A
decrease of 25 basis points in the long-term rate of return would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $33 million;

•

A
decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $51 million; and

•

An
increase of 25 basis points in the future compensation rate would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately $21 million.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is
required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cumulative effects of
applying FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Additionally, in May 2007, the FASB published FASB Staff Position No.
FIN 48-1, "Definition of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48" ("FSP FIN 48-1").


FSP
FIN 48-1 is an amendment to FIN 48. It clarifies how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously
unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN 48-1 is effective upon the initial adoption of FIN 48, and therefore will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. While we are still
evaluating the impact of adoption of FIN 48 and FSP FIN 48-1 on our consolidated financial statements, we estimate that the adoption of FIN 48 and FSP FIN 48-1 will result in a
net increase to retained earnings in the range of $500 million to $900 million. This estimate is subject to revision as management completes its analysis.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 provides
guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities. It also responds to investors' requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at
fair value, the information used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or
liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on our
consolidated results of operations and financial condition and are not yet in a position to determine such effects.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—An Amendment of FASB
No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)" ("SFAS 158"). SFAS 158 requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the company's balance sheet and changes
in the funded status be reflected in comprehensive income, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, which we adopted during fiscal 2007. See Note 15 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8 for the effect of applying this provision on the consolidated financial statements. SFAS 158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as
of the date of their fiscal year end, effective for fiscal years
ending after December 15, 2008. We expect to adopt the measurement provisions of SFAS 158 effective October 31, 2009.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value.
Under SFAS 159, a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
securities, equity method investments, accounts payable, guarantees and issued debt. Other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at
inception and non-cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services. If the use of fair value is elected, any upfront
costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred, such as debt issuance costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an
instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value. At the adoption date, unrealized gains and losses
on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of SFAS 159, changes in fair value are
recognized in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We currently are
determining whether fair value accounting is appropriate for any of our eligible items and cannot


estimate
the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In
June 2007, the FASB also ratified EITF 07-3, "Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and
Development Activities" ("EITF 07-3"). EITF 07-3 requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and
development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed. EITF 07-3 is effective, on a prospective
basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. We do not expect the adoption of EITF 07-3 to have a
material effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an
acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired.
SFAS 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective as of the beginning of
an entity's fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are currently evaluating the potential
impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS 141R on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51" ("SFAS 160"). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of
consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent's ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a
subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling
owners. SFAS 160 is effective as of the beginning of an entity's fiscal year that begins after December 15, 2008, and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. We are
currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS 160 on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In
addition to the SFAS 158 adoption mentioned above, we adopted the following accounting standards in fiscal 2007, none of which had a material effect on our consolidated results
of operations during such period or financial condition at the end of such period:

•

SFAS
No. 154, "Accounting for Changes and Error Corrections";

•

Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements";

•

EITF
05-5, "Accounting for Early Retirement or Postemployment Programs with Specific Features (Such as Terms Specified in Altersteilzeit Early Retirement
Arrangements)"; and

•

EITF
06-9, "Reporting a Change in (or the Elimination of) a Previously Existing Difference between the Fiscal Year End of a Parent Company and That of a
Consolidated Entity or between the Reporting Period of an Investor and That of an Equity Method Investee."

In
fiscal 2007, HP net revenue increased approximately 14% from the prior year period (10% on a constant currency basis). The favorable currency impact for fiscal 2007 was due primarily
to the movement of the dollar against the euro. U.S. net revenue was $34.8 billion for fiscal 2007, an increase of 8% from the prior year, while international net revenue increased 17% to
$69.5 billion.

PSG
had double-digit net revenue growth across all regions as a result of overall unit volume increases of 28%. The unit volume increases resulted from strong growth in notebooks with
significant improvements in emerging markets. The impact of these increases was partially offset by declines in average selling prices ("ASPs") in commercial and consumer clients of 5% and 1%,
respectively. IPG net revenue growth in fiscal 2007 was due mainly to increased unit volumes of printer supplies resulting from the continued expansion of printer hardware placements and the strong
performance of supplies for color-related products. ESS net revenue growth during fiscal 2007 was the result primarily of strong blade revenue and unit growth in our industry standard servers
business, increased option attach rates in our ProLiant server line, continued strong performance in mid-range EVA products, growth in commercial storage area networks and revenue
increases from our Integrity servers. The ESS growth was partially moderated by the revenue declines in our tape business, high-end arrays and our PA-RISC and Alpha server
product lines during fiscal 2007. The net revenue growth in HP Software during fiscal 2007 was due primarily to growth in our OpenView business as a result of the Mercury acquisition and increases in
revenue from license and support contracts. HPS net revenue during fiscal 2007 increased due primarily to favorable currency impacts, revenue increases in outsourcing services driven by existing
accounts growth and new business, and revenue increases in consulting and integration associated with acquisitions made in fiscal 2007. The HPFS net revenue increase during fiscal 2007 was due
primarily to operating lease growth and higher end-of-lease activity.

In
fiscal 2006, HP net revenue increased approximately 6% from the prior year period (7% on a constant currency basis). The unfavorable currency impact for fiscal 2006 was due primarily
to the movement of the dollar against the euro and the yen. U.S. net revenue was $32.2 billion for fiscal 2006, an increase of 6% from the prior year, while international net revenue increased
6% to $59.4 billion.

PSG
net revenue increased across all regions as a result of a 15% volume increase. The volume increase resulted from strong growth in consumer and commercial markets and significant
improvement in emerging markets, which was partially offset by 6% and 7% declines in ASPs in consumer and


commercial
clients, respectively. IPG net revenue growth in fiscal 2006 was due mainly to increased shipment volumes of printer supplies resulting from the continued expansion of printer hardware
placements and the strong performance of color-related products. ESS net revenue growth was the result primarily of strong unit growth in our industry standard servers business, blade revenue growth,
increased option attach rates in our ProLiant server line, continued strong performance in mid-range EVA products within our Storage business and revenue increases from our Integrity
servers. The ESS growth was moderated by revenue declines in our tape business and PA-RISC and Alpha Server product lines. The net revenue growth in HP Software for fiscal 2006 was due
primarily to growth in our OpenView business as a result of the Peregrine acquisition and an increase in support and service contracts. HPS net revenue increased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to
revenue increases in management services driven by new business and existing account growth, which were offset by declines in the technology services business resulting from competitive pricing
pressures and changes in the mix of platforms being serviced. The HPFS net revenue decline in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to lower used equipment sales.

Total
company gross margin increased slightly in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The improvement in HP Software gross margin in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to a favorable change in
revenue mix driven by the inclusion of revenue from Mercury licenses and support, which typically have a higher gross margin than the other offerings within the segment. HPS gross margin increased
during fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 due primarily to continued focus on cost structure improvements from delivery efficiencies and cost controls. This gross margin increase was partially offset by the
impact from the continued competitive pricing environment. During fiscal 2007, ESS contributed unfavorably to our total company's weighted-average change in gross margin while the ESS gross margin
remained stable. This stability was due primarily to improved cost management, which was offset by an ongoing mix shift to lower-margin Integrity products within business critical systems and a
continued mix shift towards industry standard servers. HPFS gross margin decline during fiscal 2007 was caused primarily by increased bad debt expenses and lower bad debt recoveries, as well as lower
margins on leases and


used
equipment sales. During fiscal 2007, PSG contributed unfavorably to our total company's weighted-average change in gross margin as a result of higher growth than the other segments. However, PSG
gross margin increased primarily as a result of component cost declines and improvements in supply chain costs per unit, which were partially offset by ASP declines. During fiscal 2007, IPG gross
margin decreased due primarily to unfavorable hardware margins, increased costs associated with new product introductions and a change in product mix.

Total
company gross margin increased in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005. The improvement in ESS gross margin in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a favorable unit mix, improved
discount management, and lower component costs. HPS gross margin increase was driven mainly by the continued focus on cost structure improvement from delivery efficiencies and cost controls, the
impact of which was partially offset by the continued competitive environment in the solutions and services business and higher fiscal 2006 bonus accruals. For IPG, gross margin increased in fiscal
2006 due primarily to improved supplies margins and a favorable portfolio mix shift from hardware to supplies, which were partially offset by unfavorable consumer hardware margins. The improvement in
HP Software gross margin in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to an increase in revenue and more effective management of the support and services costs for OpenView and OpenCall. The gross margin
improvement in PSG resulted primarily from reduced warranty expense and supply chain costs as a percentage of revenue and component cost declines. HPFS gross margin was impacted unfavorably in fiscal
2006 due primarily to competitor pricing pressures, a higher mix of lower margin operating lease assets and lower recoveries for bad debts, which were partially offset by lower credit losses in fiscal
2006.

Operating Expenses

Research and Development

Total
research and development ("R&D") expense increased in fiscal 2007 due primarily to additional R&D expense as a result of the Mercury acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal
2007. As a percentage of net revenue, each of our major segments experienced a year-over-year decrease in R&D expense in fiscal 2007.

Total
R&D expense increased in fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher bonus accruals and stock-based compensation expense, the impact of which was partially offset by expense controls and
cost savings from restructuring actions. As a percentage of net revenue, each of our major segments experienced a year-over-year decrease in R&D expense in fiscal 2006.

Selling, General and Administrative

Total
SG&A expense increased during fiscal 2007 due primarily to additional expense as a result of the acquisition of Mercury in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, unfavorable currency
impacts related to the movement of the dollar against the euro and additional investments in our sales forces. As a percentage of net revenue, the ESS, HPS, PSG and IPG segments experienced a
year-over-year decrease in SG&A expense during fiscal 2007, while HP Software experienced a year-over-year increase in SG&A expense.

Total
SG&A expense increased slightly during fiscal 2006 as higher bonus accruals and stock-based compensation expenses as well as increased marketing spending were offset in part by
savings from expense controls and restructuring actions and favorable currency impacts due to movement of the


dollar
against the euro and the yen. As a percentage of net revenue, each of our segments experienced a year-over-year decrease or no change in fiscal 2006.

Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets

The
increase in amortization expense in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was due primarily to amortization expense related to the acquisition of Mercury in the first quarter of
fiscal 2007. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets associated with prior acquisitions, including the Compaq Computer Corporation
("Compaq") acquisition, that had reached the end of their amortization period.

The
decrease in amortization expense in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 was due primarily to a decrease in amortization expense related to certain intangible assets associated
with prior acquisitions including the Compaq acquisition that had reached the end of their amortization period, which decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization expense related
primarily to the acquisitions of Scitex Vision Ltd. ("Scitex"), Peregrine Systems, Inc. ("Peregrine"), and OuterBay Technologies, Inc. ("OuterBay") in fiscal year 2006.

For
more information on our amortization of purchased intangibles assets, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

In-Process Research and Development Charges

We
record in-process research and development ("IPR&D") charges in connection with acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, as more fully described in
Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 we recorded IPR&D charges of $190 million, $52 million, and $2 million,
respectively, related to acquisitions during those years. The increase in IPR&D in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to our acquisition of Mercury in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

Restructuring Charges

Restructuring
charges for fiscal 2007 were $387 million, which included $354 million of expenses related to severance and other benefit costs associated with those
employees who elected to participate in the 2007 EER and a net charge of $33 million relating to adjustments to our fiscal 2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001 restructuring programs.

Restructuring
charges in fiscal year 2006 were $158 million. This included a net charge of $233 million related to true-ups of severance and other related
restructuring charges for all restructuring plans, a $6 million termination benefits expense and a $3 million settlement and curtailment loss from our non-U.S. pension plans
related to the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. These charges were partially offset by a $46 million settlement
gain from the U.S. pension plans, a $24 million curtailment gain from the U.S. retiree medical program and a $14 million adjustment to reduce our non-cash stock-based
compensation expense, all related to our fiscal 2005 restructuring plan approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005.

Restructuring
charges in fiscal 2005 were $1.7 billion, which included a $1.6 billion charge for the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan approved in the fourth quarter of fiscal
2005. The fiscal 2005 restructuring plan was designed to simplify our structure, reduce costs and place greater focus on our customers. We initially estimated that 15,300 positions would be eliminated
in the fiscal 2005 restructuring plan.


Subsequent
to the initial estimate, we reduced the number of total positions to be eliminated to 14,985. We had substantially completed eliminating these positions as of October 31, 2007. The
remaining charge for fiscal 2005 of $109 million was related to severance and related costs associated with the termination of approximately 1,450 employees in connection with a restructuring
plan approved by our management in the third quarter of fiscal 2005. All employees under this restructuring plan were terminated as of October 31, 2005. We paid all of the costs associated with
the fiscal 2005 third quarter restructuring plan as of January 31, 2007.

For
more information on our restructuring charges, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Workforce Rebalancing

As part of our ongoing business operations, we incur workforce rebalancing charges for severance and related costs within certain business segments. Workforce
rebalancing activities are considered part of normal operations as we continue to optimize our cost structure and are included in our business segment results. We expect to incur additional workforce
rebalancing costs in the future.

Pension Curtailments and Pension Settlements, Net

In
fiscal 2007, we recognized a net gain on pension curtailments and settlements of $517 million, relating primarily to a $542 million curtailment gain associated with a
modification to our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and post-retirement benefit plan. This curtailment gain was offset partially by net settlement losses related to our other pension plan design
changes.

In
conjunction with management's plan to restructure certain of our operations, we modified our U.S. retirement programs to align them more closely to industry practice. Effective
January 1, 2006, we ceased pension accruals and eliminated eligibility for the subsidized retiree medical program for employees who did not meet defined criteria based on age and years of
service. As a result, we recognized a curtailment gain of $199 million in fiscal 2005 stemming from the elimination of future benefit accruals for the affected employee group.

For
more information on our plan design changes, see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Interest and Other, Net

Interest and other, net decreased by $162 million in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The decrease was due primarily to higher interest expense resulting from
higher average debt balances.

Interest
and other, net increased by $523 million in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The increase in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from higher net interest income over the prior
year related to higher short-term interest rates in fiscal 2006, net gains from sales of certain real estate properties, and lower interest expense due to our lower average debt balances.
The increase in fiscal 2006 also was attributable to a net $106 million of dispute settlement charge and its related interest charge recorded in fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2005, we reached a legal
settlement of $141 million in our patent infringement case with Intergraph Hardware Technologies Company ("Intergraph") and recorded a charge of $116 million related to a cross-license
agreement with Intergraph for products shipped in prior years. Partially offsetting this amount was a $10 million recovery from an individual related to a prior period settlement with the
Government of Canada.


Gains (Losses) on Investments

Net gains on investment in fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from gains on the sale of equity investments, which were offset in part by impairment
charges on our investment portfolio. Net losses in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from impairment charges on equity investments in our publicly-traded and privately-held investment
portfolios. Partially offsetting these losses were gains attributable to the sale of investments.

Provision for Taxes

Our effective tax rates were 20.8%, 13.8%, and 32.3% in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

The
increase in the overall tax rate in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 was related in part to favorable income tax adjustments of $599 million recorded in fiscal 2006, which
included net favorable tax adjustments of $565 million to income tax accruals as a result of the settlement of IRS examinations of our U.S. income tax returns for fiscal years 1993 to 1998. The
reductions to the net income tax accruals for these years related primarily to the resolution of issues with respect to Puerto Rico manufacturing tax incentives and export tax incentives, and other
issues involving our non-U.S. operations.

In
addition, the decrease in the overall tax rate in 2006 from fiscal 2005 was attributable in part to $697 million of income tax expense related to items unique to fiscal 2005. The tax
expense was the result primarily of $792 million associated with the repatriation of $14.5 billion under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("Jobs Act") and $76 million
related to additional distributions received from foreign subsidiaries. These tax expenses were offset in part by tax benefits of $177 million resulting from agreements with the IRS and other
governmental authorities. The Jobs Act, enacted on October 22, 2004, provided for a temporary 85% dividend received deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period.
The deduction resulted in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings.

For
a full reconciliation of our effective tax rate to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% and further explanation of our provision for taxes, see Note 13 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Segment Information

A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each segment can be found in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in
Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference. We have realigned segment financial data for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006 and 2005 to reflect changes in HP's organizational
structure that occurred at the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2007. We describe these changes more fully in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. We have
presented the business segments in this Annual Report on Form 10-K based on our management organizational structure as of October 31, 2007 and the distinct nature of various
businesses. Future changes to this organizational structure may result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed. The discussions below include the results of each of our segments.

On
a constant currency basis, ESS net revenue increased 5% in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The favorable currency impact in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to the movement of the dollar
against the euro. Industry standard servers revenue grew 14% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 as a result of strong growth in blade revenue and units, as well as increased option attach rates in
the ProLiant server line. Storage net revenue increased 4% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, with the increase driven primarily by mid-range EVA products and commercial products
within the storage area networks offerings, as well as improved revenue growth in storage software. This increase was partially moderated by the revenue declines in our tape business and
high-end arrays. Business critical systems net revenue decreased 3% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. The decrease was due primarily to revenue declines in the PA-RISC
product line and the planned phase out of our Alpha server product line. The declines were partially offset by strong net revenue growth in our Integrity servers, which represented 64% of the business
critical systems revenue mix in fiscal 2007, up from 37% in fiscal 2006. We expect revenue mix from Integrity servers to continue to grow as customers migrate from PA-RISC and Alpha
products.

In
fiscal 2007, ESS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 2.1 percentage points compared to fiscal 2006, due primarily to a decrease in operating
expenses as a percentage of net revenue. Gross margin remained stable in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due primarily to improved cost management. The improved cost management was offset by an
ongoing mix shift to lower-margin integrity products within business critical systems and a continued mix shift towards industry standard servers. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of
net revenue in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to cost structure improvements.

On
a constant currency basis, ESS net revenue increased 5% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The unfavorable currency impact for fiscal 2006 was due primarily to the movement of the
dollar against the euro and the yen. The net revenue growth in industry standard servers of 6% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was driven by strong unit growth and the growth in blade revenue
as well as increased option attach rates in the ProLiant server line. Storage net revenue increased 4% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 due to continued strong performance in
mid-range EVA products within


the
storage area networks offerings while the tape business decline moderated the overall storage growth. Business critical systems net revenue decreased 4% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005.
This decrease was due primarily to revenue declines in the PA-RISC product line and to the planned phase out of our Alpha server product line. The declines were partially offset by net
revenue growth in our Integrity servers which posted strong net revenue growth, reaching 37% of the business critical systems revenue mix in fiscal 2006 up from 20% in the prior fiscal year. Revenue
mix from Integrity servers continued to grow as customers migrated from PA-RISC and Alpha products. Integrity server revenue in fiscal 2006 also included revenue from Montecito-based
Integrity servers that were first shipped in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006. NonStop server net revenue decreased 2% in fiscal 2006 from the prior year due primarily to the revenue decrease on the
discontinued product line, which was partially offset by NonStop Integrity product revenue growth.

In
fiscal 2006, ESS earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 3.6 percentage points compared to fiscal 2005, due primarily to an increase in gross
margin combined with a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The improvement in gross margin was due primarily to a favorable unit mix, improved discount management, and lower
component costs. The increase was partially offset by a continued mix shift towards industry standard servers within the segment and the ongoing mix shift to lower-margin Integrity products within
business critical systems. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to efficient expense management.

the name change from managed services to outsourcing services effective in fiscal 2007.

On
a constant currency basis, HPS net revenue increased 3% in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2007, the favorable currency impact was due primarily to the movement of the dollar
against the euro. Net revenue in technology services increased 4% in fiscal 2007 from the prior year due primarily to favorable currency impacts, growth in the IT solution support services and
extended warranty revenue, the impact of which was partially offset by competitive pricing pressures and revenue erosion from installed base contracts. Net revenue in outsourcing services increased
10% in fiscal 2007 from the prior year. The increase was driven mainly by favorable currency impacts, existing account growth and


new
business, which were partially offset by installed base revenue erosion and pricing pressures. Net revenue in consulting and integration increased 9% in fiscal 2007 from the prior year due mainly
to acquisitions made in fiscal 2007 and favorable currency impacts.

HPS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2007 increased by 1.4 percentage points. The operating margin increase was the result of an increase in gross
margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin increase in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to the continued focus on cost structure improvements generated
by delivery efficiencies and cost controls, the impact of which was partially offset by the impact from the continued competitive pricing environment. In fiscal 2007, continued efficiency improvements
in our operating expense structure contributed to the decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue compared to the prior year. Technology services operating margin in fiscal 2007
continued to benefit from improved delivery efficiencies and cost controls, the impact of which was offset in part by the impact of the ongoing portfolio mix shift from higher margin proprietary
support to lower margin areas such as IT solution services. Outsourcing services operating margin increased in fiscal 2007 due primarily to improved delivery efficiencies and reduced operating
expenses partially offset by contractual pricing pressure. Consulting and integration operating margin decreased in fiscal 2007 due mainly to increased customer project losses and acquisition related
costs, the impact of which was partially offset by more efficient utilization of our consultants and operating expense improvement.

On
a constant currency basis, HPS net revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. In fiscal 2006, the unfavorable currency impact was due primarily to the movement of the
dollar against the euro and the yen. Net revenue in technology services decreased 3% in fiscal 2006 from the prior year due primarily to declines related to competitive pricing pressures and changes
in the mix of platforms being serviced. In fiscal 2006, the 7% growth in outsourcing services net revenue from the prior year was driven mainly by new business and existing account growth, with
continued focus on making more strategic portfolio decisions to improve profitability. Net revenue in consulting and integration increased 2% in fiscal 2006 from the prior year due primarily to
improved performance in Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa.

HPS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2006 increased by 2.2 percentage points. The operating margin increase was the result of a combination of an
increase in gross margin and a decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin increase in HPS was due primarily to the continued focus on cost structure improvement
from delivery efficiencies and cost controls, the impact of which was partially offset by the continued competitive environment in solutions and services business and higher fiscal 2006 bonus
accruals. In fiscal 2006, improved efficiencies in our operating expense structure contributed to the decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue compared to fiscal year 2005 despite
the impact of higher bonus accruals in fiscal 2006. Technology services operating margin in fiscal 2006 continued to benefit from improved delivery efficiencies and cost controls as well as portfolio
decisions made to improve profitability, all of which benefit was offset in part by the impact of the ongoing portfolio mix shift from higher margin proprietary support to lower margin areas such as
solution services. Outsourcing services operating margin increased in fiscal 2006 due to delivery efficiencies, reduced operating expenses and more strategic portfolio decisions made to improve
profitability. Consulting and integration operating margin improved in fiscal 2006 due to more efficient utilization of our consultants and reduced operating expenses.

On
a constant currency basis, HP Software revenue increased 74% in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006. The favorable currency impact was due primarily to the movement of the dollar
against the euro. Excluding the results of Mercury, HP Software's revenue grew 5% in fiscal 2007. Net revenue associated with the acquisition of Mercury was included in the results of OpenView, which
increased 121% in fiscal 2007 and 15% in the same respective period without Mercury. OpenView net revenue growth also was the result of increases in revenue from license and support contracts. Net
revenue for OpenCall, our telecommunications solutions product line, decreased 16% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in OpenCall net revenue was due primarily to a platform shift that resulted in a
transfer of the hardware revenue to ESS.

The
operating margin improvement of 8.4 percentage points in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 was the result primarily of an increase in gross margin and to a lesser degree
a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. In fiscal 2007, the improvement in gross margin was a result of a favorable change in revenue mix driven by the inclusion of revenue
from Mercury licenses and support, which typically have a higher gross margin than the other offerings in the segment, and to a lesser degree by more effective management of the support costs for
OpenView and OpenCall. Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2007 decreased due primarily to cost controls and synergy savings from the Mercury acquisition.

In
fiscal 2006, Software net revenue increased 23% (8% excluding the impact of acquisitions and 24% on a constant currency basis) from fiscal 2005. The unfavorable currency impact was
due primarily to
the movement of the dollar against the euro and the yen for fiscal 2006. Peregrine, which HP acquired in December 2005, represented 14.7 percentage points of HP Software's net revenue
growth for fiscal 2006. Net revenue associated with the Peregrine acquisition is included in the results of OpenView, our management solutions software product line, which represented
20 percentage points of growth on a weighted-average net revenue basis for fiscal 2006. OpenCall contributed the remaining 3 percentage points of the weighted-average net revenue
increase for fiscal 2006. OpenView net revenue growth was the result of acquisitions and increases in support and services contracts. OpenCall net revenue growth was the result of increased product
sales and licenses as well as larger contracts.

The
operating margin improvement of 11.1 percentage points for fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 was the result primarily of a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net
revenue and an increase in gross margin. The decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue was attributable to growth in field selling costs, research and development and marketing
expenses attributable to cost management efforts that was slower than revenue growth. These cost reductions were partially offset by high integration costs associated with the acquisition of Peregrine
as well as higher bonus accruals. The improvement in gross margin was driven by an increase in revenue, more effective management of the support and services costs for OpenView and OpenCall and from
improved margins of our OpenCall product line resulting from a favorable product mix shift towards higher margin products.

On
a constant currency basis, PSG's net revenue increased 21% in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The favorable currency impact was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the
euro. Unit volumes increased by 28% in fiscal 2007, driving double-digit net revenue growth across all regions. The unit volume increase was the result of strong growth in notebooks, with significant
improvements in emerging markets. In fiscal 2007, net revenue for notebook PCs increased 47% while net revenue for desktop PCs increased 8% from the prior-year period. In fiscal 2007, net
revenue for consumer clients increased 39%, while net revenue for commercial clients increased 16% from the prior-year period. The net revenue increase in Other PSG in fiscal 2007 was
related primarily to improvements in extended warranty sales. The revenue increase was partially offset by decreases in handhelds revenue due to declines in the Personal Digital Assistant ("PDA")
product market, which were partially offset by our new converged device and travel companion products. In fiscal 2007, the positive revenue impact from the PSG unit volume increase compared to fiscal
2006 was also moderated by a 5% decline in commercial client ASPs and a 1% decline in consumer client ASPs. ASPs declined from the prior year was a result of price erosion related to component cost
reductions, the impact of which was partially offset by increased notebook mix and monitor attach rates.

PSG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 as a result of decreases in operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenue coupled with an increase in gross margin. The increased gross margin was primarily a result of component cost declines and improvements in supply chain costs per unit, the
impact of which was partially offset by ASP declines. The operating expense decline as a percentage of net revenue in fiscal 2007 was the result primarily of the increased net revenue and continued
efforts to improve our cost structure through efficiency measures.


On a constant currency basis, PSG's net revenue increased 10% in fiscal 2006. The unfavorable currency impact was due primarily to the movement of the dollar
against the euro and the yen. In fiscal 2006, net revenue increased across all regions and each business unit with the exception of handhelds, due primarily to an overall volume increase of 15%. The
volume increase in fiscal 2006 was the result of strong growth in the consumer and commercial markets, with significant improvement in emerging markets. Net revenue for notebook PCs increased 23%
while net revenue for desktop PCs increased slightly in fiscal 2006 from the prior year. Net revenue for consumer clients and commercial clients increased 19% and 4%, respectively, from the prior
year. The revenue increases in consumer and commercial clients were partially offset by a decrease in handhelds revenue due to a decline in the PDA product market coupled with our product transition
to converged devices. The PSG volume increase in fiscal 2006 was moderated by a decline of 6% in consumer client ASPs and 7% in commercial client ASPs. The ASP declines were due to pricing decisions
resulting from lower component costs as well as competitive pricing pressures, the impact of which was partially offset by a strong monitor attach rate in commercial desktops PCs.

PSG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 1.4 percentage points in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005 as a result of gross margin improvement and a
decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. The gross margin improvement was due primarily to reduced supply chain costs and warranty expense as a percentage of net revenue, combined
with component cost declines. The operating expense decline as a percentage of net revenue was the result primarily of the increased net revenue and continued efforts on improving cost structure
through efficiency measures. Operating expenses decreased slightly in fiscal 2006 due primarily to savings from our expense controls, which savings were partially offset by higher bonus accruals in
fiscal 2006.

On

fiscal 2007. The growth in printer supplies net revenue in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 reflected higher unit volumes of supplies as a result of the continued expansion of printer hardware placements
and the strong performance of supplies for color-related products. The growth in commercial hardware net


revenue
in fiscal 2007 was attributable mainly to unit volume growth in multifunction printers and revenue from our digital press and large format printing products. The slight increase in consumer
hardware net revenue in fiscal 2007 was attributable to increased unit volumes, improved average revenue per unit performance and a mix shift from single function products to
All-in-Ones, the impact of which was partially offset by the continued shift in demand to lower priced products and strategic pricing decisions.

IPG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased by 0.3 percentage points in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006, driven by a decrease in operating expenses as a
percentage of net revenue that was partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. Gross margin decreased due primarily to unfavorable hardware margins, increased costs associated with new product
introductions and a change in product mix. Operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased due primarily to higher prior-year research and development expenses associated with
product introduction costs, coupled with higher revenue and more effective spending controls.

On
a constant currency basis, net revenue increased 7% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The unfavorable currency impact was due primarily to the movement of the dollar against the euro
and the yen in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2006, the growth in printer supplies net revenue reflected higher unit volumes as a result of the continued expansion of printer hardware placements and the
strong performance of color-related products. The growth in commercial hardware net revenue in fiscal 2006 was attributable mainly to unit volume growth in color laser printers and multifunction
printers and, to a lesser extent, revenue from our large format printing products with the acquisition of Scitex in November 2005. Commercial and consumer hardware revenue was unfavorably
impacted by the continued shift in demand to lower-priced products and strategic pricing decisions, which caused average revenue per unit to decline.

IPG
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased 1.3 percentage points in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005, which was the result primarily of an increase in gross
margin and a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin increase was due primarily to
improved margins for supplies due to product mix and a favorable portfolio mix shift from hardware to supplies, the impact of which was partially offset by unfavorable consumer hardware margins.
Operating expense as a percentage of net revenue for fiscal 2006 declined, due mainly to realized savings from our cost structure initiatives coupled with increased revenue and partially offset by
higher bonus accruals.

HPFS
net revenue increased by 12% in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The net revenue increase was due primarily to operating lease growth and higher end-of-lease

HPFS
earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased by 0.5 percentage point in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006 due primarily to a decrease in gross margin, which
was partially offset by


a
decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin decrease was driven primarily by increased bad debt expenses and lower bad debt recoveries, as well as lower margins on
leases and used equipment sales. The decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was due to continued cost controls.

HPFS
net revenue decreased by 1% in fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The net revenue decrease was due primarily to lower used equipment sales and other end-of-lease
revenue, which were largely offset by a higher mix of leases classified as operating leases.

In
fiscal 2006, the 3.0 percentage point decrease in earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue consisted of a decrease in gross margin, which was partially offset by
a decrease in operating expense as a percentage of net revenue. The gross margin decline was due primarily to competitor pricing pressures, a higher mix of lower margin operating lease assets and
lower recoveries for bad debts, the impact of which was partially offset by lower credit losses. The decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue was the result of cost savings
achieved through continued cost controls.

Portfolio Assets and Ratios

HPFS maintains a strategy to generate a competitive return on equity by effectively leveraging its portfolio against the risks associated with interest rates and
credit. The HPFS business model is asset-intensive and uses certain internal metrics to measure its performance against other financial services companies, including a segment balance sheet that is
derived from our internal management reporting system. The accounting policies used to derive these amounts are substantially the same as those used by the consolidated company. However, certain
intercompany loans and accounts that are reflected in the segment balances are eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.

The
majority of the net revenue in Corporate Investments relates to network infrastructure products sold under the brand "ProCurve Networking." In fiscal 2007, revenue from network
infrastructure products increased 33% compared to the same period in fiscal 2006 as new product introductions continued to drive increased sales of enterprise class gigabit Ethernet switch products.

Corporate
Investments' loss from operations in fiscal 2007 was due primarily to expenses associated with corporate development, global alliances and HP Labs that are carried in the
segment.


The
year-over-year decrease in operating losses was driven primarily by higher earnings from operations generated by network infrastructure products.

In
fiscal 2006, the majority of the net revenue in Corporate Investments related to network infrastructure products, which grew 8% from fiscal 2005 as a result of increased sales of
gigabit Ethernet switch products.

Corporate
Investments' loss from operations in fiscal 2006 decreased compared to fiscal 2005 due primarily to lower operating expenses related to global alliances and HP Labs and higher
gross profits from network infrastructure products. The decrease in operating expenses was due primarily to savings resulting from restructuring actions and lower program spending. Expenses related to
global alliances and HP Labs contributed to the majority of the loss from operations.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Our cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world, including substantial amounts held outside of the United States. Most of the amounts held
outside of the United States could be repatriated to the United States but under current law would be subject to United States federal income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits. Repatriation
of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws. We have provided for the United States federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes, except for foreign earnings that
are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States. Repatriation could result in additional United States federal income tax payments in future years. Our intent is that most of the
non-U.S. cash balances would remain outside of the United States and we would meet United States liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows, external borrowings, or both. We utilize a variety of tax
planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that our worldwide cash or debt is available in the locations in which it is needed.

FINANCIAL CONDITION (Sources and Uses of Cash)

Our total cash and cash equivalents declined approximately 31% to $11.3 billion at October 31, 2007 from $16.4 billion at October 31,
2006 due primarily to increased spending for repurchases of our common stock and investment spending on acquisitions, which spending was partially offset by positive operating cash flows and increased
borrowings. The net $14.7 billion used for investing and financing activities during fiscal 2007 included $10.9 billion for share repurchases, $6.8 billion for cash payments in
connection with acquisitions and $2.5 billion for net investments in property, plant and equipment. Partially offsetting these cash expenditures were $3.1 billion of proceeds relating to
the issuance of stock under employee stock plans and a $2.6 billion net increase in our debt and commercial paper from increased borrowings. Our cash position remains strong, and we believe our
cash balances are sufficient to cover cash outlays expected in fiscal 2008 associated with additional stock repurchases, acquisitions, company bonus payments, and other operating cash requirements.

Cash conversion cycle




Days
of sales outstanding in accounts receivable ("DSO") measures the average number of days our receivables are outstanding. DSO is calculated by dividing accounts receivable, net of
allowance for doubtful accounts, by a 90-day average net revenue.

Days
of supply in inventory ("DOS") measures the average number of days from procurement to sale of our product. DOS is calculated by dividing inventory by a 90-day average
cost of goods sold.

Days
of purchases outstanding in accounts payable ("DPO") measures the average number of days our accounts payable balances are outstanding. DPO is calculated by dividing accounts
payable by a 90-day average cost of goods sold.

Our
working capital requirements depend upon our effective management of the cash conversion cycle, which represents effectively the number of days that elapse from the day we pay for
the purchase of raw materials to the collection of cash from our customers. The cash conversion cycle is the sum of DSO and DOS less DPO.

The
increase in DSO was due primarily to selectively extending payment terms and reducing cash discount rates for early payments for certain customers. The decrease in DOS was due
primarily to more efficient inventory management and higher cost of goods sold during the fourth quarter as a result of increased revenues. The decrease in DPO was due primarily to purchasing
linearity and reduced payment terms and cash discounts from our major contract manufacturers. These changes contributed to the increase in our current year cash conversion cycle compared to the prior
year.

2007 Compared to 2006

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $1.7 billion during fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The decrease was due primarily to an increase in
accounts receivable, a decrease in accounts payable and higher payments for bonuses earned in fiscal 2006 and paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The decease in our cash flow from operations was
partially offset by higher earnings in fiscal 2007.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $6.3 billion in fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006, due primarily to higher cash payments made in connection
with acquisitions.


Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $0.5 billion during fiscal 2007 from fiscal 2006. The decrease was due primarily to higher net issuance
of commercial paper and debt, the impact of which was partially offset by increased repurchases of our common stock.

Common Stock Repurchases

We repurchase shares of our common stock under an ongoing program to manage the dilution created by shares issued under employee benefit plans as well as to
repurchase shares opportunistically. This program authorizes repurchases in the open market or in private transactions. In fiscal 2007, we completed share repurchases of approximately
209 million shares. Repurchases of approximately 210 million shares were settled for $9.1 billion, which included approximately 1 million shares repurchased in transactions
that were executed in fiscal 2006 but settled in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, we completed share repurchases of approximately 188 million shares. Repurchases of approximately 190 million
shares were settled for $6.1 billion in fiscal 2006, including 2 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal 2005 but settled in fiscal 2006.

In
addition to the above transactions, we entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase program (the "ASR Program") with a third-party investment bank during the second quarter of fiscal
2007. Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Program, we purchased 40 million shares of our common stock from the investment bank for $1.8 billion (the "Purchase Price") on March 30,
2007 (the "Purchase Date"). We decreased our shares outstanding and reduced the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS on
the Purchase Date. The shares delivered to us included shares that the investment bank borrowed from third parties. The investment bank purchased an equivalent number of shares in the open market to
cover its position with respect to the borrowed shares during a contractually specified averaging period that began on the Purchase Date and ended on June 6, 2007. At the end of the averaging
period, the investment bank's total purchase cost based on the volume weighted-average purchase price of our shares during the averaging period was approximately $90 million less than the
Purchase Price. Accordingly, we had the option to receive either additional shares of our common stock or a cash payment in the amount of the difference from the investment bank. In June 2007,
we received approximately 2 million additional shares purchased by the investment bank in the open market with a value approximately equal to that amount. We reduced our shares outstanding upon
receipt of those shares.

Also,
we entered into a prepaid variable share purchase program ("PVSPP") with a third-party investment bank during the first quarter of 2006 and prepaid $1.7 billion in exchange
for the right to receive a variable number of shares of our common stock weekly over a one-year period beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and ending during the second quarter of fiscal
2007. We completed all
repurchases under the PVSPP on March 9, 2007. As of that date, we had cumulatively received a total of 53 million shares. We retired all shares repurchased and no longer deem those
shares outstanding.

We
intend to continue to repurchase shares as a means to manage dilution from the issuance of shares under employee benefit plans and to purchase shares opportunistically. On
March 15, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $8.0 billion for future share repurchases. As of October 31, 2007, we had remaining authorization of approximately
$2.7 billion for future share repurchases. On November 19, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $8.0 billion for future share repurchases. For more information on
our share repurchases, see Item 5 and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which are incorporated herein by reference.


2006 Compared to 2005

Operating Activities

Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $3.3 billion during fiscal 2006. The increase in our cash flow from operations was due primarily to
higher earnings and lower payments for pension and taxes, with the increase partially offset by higher payments for restructuring costs.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities increased by $1.0 billion during fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher capital expenditures for property, plant and
equipment, lower net proceeds from maturities and sales of investments and higher amounts of cash paid for acquisitions.

Financing Activities

Net cash used in financing activities increased by $1.1 billion during fiscal 2006 from fiscal 2005. The increase was due primarily to a
$2.5 billion increase in repurchases of common stock and a $1.7 billion prepayment for common stock to be repurchased in future periods. These expenditures were partially offset by a
$1.6 billion net increase to financing activities resulting from higher borrowings and lower debt payments and $1.4 billion increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock related
to our employee stock plans due mainly to increased exercises of employee stock options as a result of higher market prices for our common stock during fiscal 2006.

Common Stock Repurchases

In fiscal 2006, we completed share repurchases of approximately 188 million shares. Repurchases of approximately 190 million shares were settled for
$6.1 billion, which included 2 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal 2005 but settled in fiscal 2006, as compared to approximately 150 million
shares repurchased, of which 148 million shares were settled for $3.5 billion in fiscal 2005.

In
addition to the shares we repurchased, we received approximately 34 million shares for an aggregate price of $1.1 billion under PVSPP as described above. Under the
PVSPP, we prepaid $1.7 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2006 in exchange for the right to receive a variable number of shares of our common stock weekly over a one-year period beginning
in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and ending during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. We recorded the payment as a prepaid stock repurchase in the stockholders' equity section of our Consolidated
Balance Sheet and included the payment in the cash flows from financing activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. In connection with this program, the investment bank purchased shares of
our common stock in the open market over time. The prepaid funds were expended ratably over the term of the program.

During
fiscal 2006, our Board of Directors authorized an additional $10.0 billion for future repurchases of our outstanding shares of common stock. As of October 31, 2006,
we had remaining authorization of approximately $5.6 billion for future share repurchases.

LIQUIDITY

As previously discussed, we use cash generated by operations as our primary source of liquidity; we believe that internally generated cash flows are sufficient to
support business operations, capital expenditures and the payment of stockholder dividends, in addition to a level of discretionary


investments
and share repurchases. We are able to supplement this near-term liquidity, if necessary, with broad access to capital markets and credit line facilities made available by various foreign
and domestic financial institutions.

We
maintain debt levels that we establish through consideration of a number of factors, including cash flow expectations, cash requirements for operations, investment plans (including
acquisitions), share repurchase activities, and the overall cost of capital. Outstanding debt increased to $8.2 billion as of October 31, 2007 as compared to $5.2 billion at
October 31, 2006, bearing weighted-average interest rates of 5.2% and 5.1%, respectively. Short-term borrowings increased to $3.2 billion at October 31, 2007 from
$2.7 billion at October 31, 2006. The increase in short-term borrowings was due primarily to the net issuance of approximately $1.9 billion of our commercial paper and
notes payable and the reclassification from long-term to short-term debt, including $500 million U.S. Dollar Global Notes that will mature in March 2008 and
$50 million Series A Medium-Term Notes that matured and we repaid in December 2007. The increase was offset partially by our repayment of $1.0 billion Global
Notes in December 2006 and $1.0 billion Global Notes in July 2007. During fiscal 2007, we issued $32 billion and repaid $30 billion of commercial paper. As of
October 31, 2007, we had $5 million in total borrowings collateralized by certain financing receivable assets.

The
majority of our outstanding debt relates to HPFS. We issue debt in order to finance HPFS and as needed for other purposes. HPFS has a business model that is asset-intensive in nature
and therefore we fund HPFS more by debt than we fund our other business segments. At October 31, 2007, HPFS had approximately $8.3 billion in net portfolio assets, which included short-
and long-term financing receivables and operating lease assets.

We
have the following resources available to obtain short-term or long-term financings, if we need additional liquidity:

Approximately
$151 million of this amount was recorded as debt as of October 31, 2007; the remaining amount was used to satisfy business operational
requirements.

In
addition to the financing resources listed above, we had additional borrowing activities as described below.

In
November 2006, in connection with the Mercury acquisition, we assumed notes issued by Mercury with a face value of $300 million, maturing on July 1, 2007 and
bearing interest at a rate of


4.75%
per annum (the "Mercury Notes"). As of July 31, 2007, we had repurchased or repaid at maturity all of the Mercury Notes.

In
May 2006, we filed a shelf registration statement (the "2006 Shelf Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to enable us to offer and
sell from time to time, in one or more offerings, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. On May 23, 2006, we issued $1.0 billion in floating rate
global notes due May 22, 2009 under the 2006 Shelf Registration Statement that we redeemed in June 2007.

On
February 22, 2007, we issued an additional $2.0 billion of global notes under the 2006 Shelf Registration Statement. The global notes included $600 million of
notes due March 2012 with a floating interest rate equal to the three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.11% per annum, $900 million of notes due March 2012 with a fixed interest rate of
5.25% per annum and $500 million of notes due March 2017 with a fixed interest rate of 5.40% per annum. We issued the $600 million notes at par and the $900 million notes
and $500 million notes at discounts to par at 99.938% and 99.694%, respectively. We used the net proceeds from these note offerings for general corporate purposes, including funding the
repurchase of the Mercury Notes as described above and repaying short-term commercial paper.

On
June 12, 2007, we issued an additional $2.0 billion of global notes under the 2006 Shelf Registration Statement. The global notes included $1.0 billion of notes
due June 2009 with a floating interest rate equal to the three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.01% per annum, and $1.0 billion of notes due June 2010 with a floating interest rate equal to
the three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.06% per annum. We issued these global notes at par. We used the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes, including the redemption of the
floating rate global notes due May 22, 2009 as described above in June 2007 and the repayment of short-term commercial paper.

On
December 17, 2007, we repaid $50 million Series A Medium-Term Notes due December 2007 at maturity.

We
have a $3.0 billion U.S. credit facility expiring in May 2012. This credit facility is a senior unsecured committed borrowing arrangement that we put in place primarily
to support our U.S. commercial paper program. Our ability to have a U.S. commercial paper outstanding balance that exceeds the $3.0 billion committed credit facility is subject to a number of
factors, including liquidity conditions and business performance.

Our
credit risk is evaluated by three independent rating agencies based upon publicly available information as well as information obtained in our ongoing discussions with them.
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings currently rate our senior unsecured long-term debt A, A2 and A+ and our short-term debt
A-1, Prime-1 and F1, respectively. We do not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity of a material amount of our debt. However, a downgrade in our
credit rating would increase the cost of borrowings under our credit facilities. Also, a downgrade in our credit rating could limit our ability to issue commercial paper under our current programs. If
this occurs, we would seek alternative sources of funding, including through drawdowns under our credit facility or the issuance of notes under our existing shelf registration statements and our Euro
Medium-Term Note Programme.

We
have revolving trade receivables-based facilities permitting us to sell certain trade receivables to third parties on a non-recourse basis. The aggregate maximum capacity
under these programs was approximately $525 million as of October 31, 2007. We sold approximately $2.2 billion of trade


receivables
during fiscal 2007. As of October 31, 2007, we had approximately $117 million available under these programs.

Contractual Obligations

The impact that we expect our contractual obligations as of October 31, 2007 to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows:

long-term debt are approximately $48 million of capital lease obligations that are secured by certain equipment.

(2)

Purchase
obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms, including
fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable
without penalty. These purchase obligations are related principally to inventory and other items.

Funding Commitments

During fiscal 2007, we made approximately $133 million of contributions to non-U.S. pension plans, paid $16 million to cover benefit
payments to U.S. non-qualified plan participants, and paid $58 million to cover benefit claims under post-retirement benefit plans. In addition, we used
$108 million of cash to fund the distribution and subsequent transfer of accrued pension benefits from the U.S. Excess Benefit Plan to the U.S. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan for the
terminated vested plan participants. In fiscal 2008, we expect to contribute approximately $145 million to our pension plans and approximately $15 million to cover benefit payments to
U.S. non-qualified plan participants. We also expect to pay approximately $80 million to cover benefit claims for our post-retirement benefit plans in fiscal 2008. Our
funding policy is to contribute cash to our pension plans so that we meet at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government and funding and taxing authorities. We
expect to use contributions made to the post-retirement benefit plans primarily for the payment of retiree health claims incurred during the fiscal year.

In
conjunction with our February 2007 announcement to modify our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and our Pre-2003 Retiree Medical Program, we offered eligible affected
employees an option to participate in the 2007 EER. We funded the cash expenditures associated with the 2007 EER primarily by using available U.S. pension plan assets. We made no incremental pension
contributions to the pension plan stemming from the 2007 EER.


We
have implemented bonus programs that are designed to reward our employees upon achievement of annual performance objectives. We calculate bonuses based on a formula, with targets that
are set at the beginning of each fiscal year. Our Board of Directors approves both the formula and the targets.

In
fiscal 2007, we outperformed against our targets, which will result in a significant bonus payout during the first quarter of fiscal 2008 and a corresponding reduction of cash flow
from operations in that quarter. We accrued and expensed this bonus, as it was earned, throughout fiscal 2007.

As
a result of our approved restructuring plans, we expect future cash expenditures of $173 million, which we recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 31, 2007. We
expect to make cash payments of approximately $123 million in fiscal 2008 and the majority of the remaining $50 million through 2014.

Pending and Subsequent Acquisitions

For pending acquisitions, see Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As part of our ongoing business, we do not participate in transactions that generate material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities ("SPEs"), which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance
sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As of October 31, 2007, we are not involved in any material unconsolidated SPEs.

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the third-party to such arrangement from any
losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of us or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or
claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments we have made related to these indemnifications have been
immaterial.


ITEM 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and equity price risks that could impact our financial position
and results of operations. Our risk management strategy with respect to these three market risks may include the use of derivative financial instruments. We use derivative contracts only to manage
existing underlying exposures of HP. Accordingly, we do not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. Our risks, risk management strategy and a sensitivity analysis estimating the effects of
changes in fair values for each of these exposures are outlined below.

Actual
gains and losses in the future may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses based on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and
equity price movements and our actual exposures and hedges.

Foreign currency exchange rate risk

We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments, anticipated sales, anticipated purchases and assets, liabilities and debt
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We transact business in approximately 40 currencies worldwide, of which the most significant to our operations for fiscal 2007 were the euro, the
Japanese yen and the British pound. For most currencies, we are a net receiver of the foreign currency and therefore benefit from a weaker U.S. dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger U.S.
dollar relative to the foreign currency. Even where we are a net receiver, a weaker U.S. dollar may adversely affect certain expense figures taken alone. We use a combination of forward contracts and
options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in our forecasted net revenue and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, when debt is denominated in a foreign currency, we may use swaps to exchange the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S.
dollar-denominated amounts to manage the exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We also use other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," consisting primarily of forward contracts to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. We recognize the gains and losses on
foreign currency forward contracts in the same period as the remeasurement losses and gains of the related foreign currency-denominated exposures. Alternatively, we may choose not to hedge the foreign
currency risk associated with our foreign currency exposures if such exposure acts as a natural foreign
currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency or the currency is difficult or too expensive to hedge.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2007 and 2006, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover all of our foreign currency contracts offset
by the underlying exposures. The foreign currency exchange rates we used were based on market rates in effect at October 31, 2007 and 2006. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a
hypothetical 10% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a foreign exchange loss of $104 million at both October 31, 2007 and October 31, 2006.

Interest rate risk

We also are exposed to interest rate risk related to our debt and investment portfolios and financing receivables. We issue long-term debt in either
U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. We then typically use interest rate and/or currency swaps to modify the market risk exposures in connection with
the debt to achieve primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense. The swap transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for


floating
interest payments. However, we may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if we believe a larger proportion of
fixed-rate debt would be beneficial. In order to hedge the fair value of certain fixed-rate investments, we may enter into interest rate swaps that convert fixed interest
returns into variable interest returns. We may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based interest income received on certain variable-rate investments. We may also enter
into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns.

We
have performed sensitivity analyses as of October 31, 2007 and 2006, using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical 10%
adverse movement in the levels of interest rates across the entire yield curve, with all other variables held constant. The analyses cover our debt, investment instruments, financing receivables and
interest rate swaps. The analyses use actual maturities for the debt, investments and interest rate swaps and approximate maturities for financing receivables. The discount rates we used were based on
the market interest rates in effect at October 31, 2007 and 2006. The sensitivity analyses indicated that a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in interest rates would result in a loss in the
fair values of our debt and investment instruments and financing receivables, net of interest rate swap positions, of $17 million at October 31, 2007 and $19 million at
October 31, 2006.

Equity price risk

We are also exposed to equity price risk inherent in our portfolio of publicly-traded equity securities, which had an estimated fair value of $9 million at
October 31, 2007 and $36 million at October 31, 2006. We monitor our equity investments for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of the equity
investment exceeds its fair value, and we determine the decline in value to be other than temporary, we reduce the carrying value to its current fair value. Generally, we do not attempt to reduce or
eliminate our market exposure on these equity securities. However, we may use derivative transactions to hedge certain positions from time to time. We do not purchase our equity securities with the
intent to use them for speculative purposes. A hypothetical 30% adverse change in the stock prices of our publicly-traded equity securities would result in a loss in the fair values of our marketable
equity securities of $3 million at October 31, 2007 and $11 million at October 31, 2006. The aggregate cost of privately-held companies and other investments
was $533 million at October 31, 2007 and $362 million at October 31, 2006.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett-Packard Company

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related
consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial statement
schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and schedule based on our audits.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In
our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Hewlett-Packard Company and subsidiaries at
October 31, 2007 and 2006, and the consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2007, in conformity with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents
fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of Hewlett-Packard Company's internal control
over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated December 14, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion
thereon.

As
discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, in fiscal year 2007, Hewlett-Packard Company changed its method of accounting for defined benefit postretirement
plans in accordance with the guidance provided in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
Plans—An Amendment of FASB No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)" and, in fiscal year 2006, changed its method of accounting for stock-based compensation in accordance with guidance provided
in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R), "Share-Based Payment".

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of

Hewlett-Packard Company

We have audited Hewlett-Packard Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007, based on criteria established in Internal
Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria).
Hewlett-Packard Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal
control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control
over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A
company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures
that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In
our opinion, Hewlett-Packard Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007 based on the COSO
criteria.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Hewlett-Packard
Company and subsidiaries as of October 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended October 31, 2007 and our report dated December 14, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

HP's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for HP. HP's internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. HP's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of HP; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of HP are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
management and directors of HP; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of HP's assets that could have a
material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

HP's
management assessed the effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007, utilizing the criteria set forth by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on the assessment by HP's management, we determined that HP's internal control over financial
reporting was effective as of October 31, 2007. The effectiveness of HP's internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2007 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP,
HP's independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears on page 73 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

HEWLETT-PACKARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Hewlett-Packard Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and its controlled majority-owned
subsidiaries (collectively, "HP"). HP accounts for equity investments in companies over which HP has the ability to exercise significant influence, but does not hold a controlling interest, under the
equity method, and HP records its proportionate share of income or losses in interest and other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. HP has eliminated all significant intercompany accounts
and transactions.

Reclassifications and Segment Reorganization

HP has made certain organizational realignments in order to more closely align its financial reporting with its business structure. These realignments are
immaterial in size and reflect primarily revenue shifts among business units within the same business segment. None of the changes impacts HP's previously reported consolidated net revenue, earnings
from operations, net earnings or net earnings per share.

HP
has revised the presentation of its Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2006 and 2005 to
provide improved visibility and comparability with the current year presentation. This change does not affect previously reported results of operations for any period presented, or previously reported
subtotals within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in HP's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Net revenue is derived primarily from the sale of products and services. The following revenue recognition policies define the manner in which HP accounts for
sales transactions.

HP
recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services are rendered, the sales price or fee is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured. Additionally when HP recognizes revenue on sales to channel partners, including resellers, distributors or value-added solution providers we do so when the
channel partners have economic substance apart from HP and we have completed our obligations related to the sale.

When
a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and software products, licenses and/or services, HP allocates revenue to each element based on its relative fair
value, or for software, based on vendor specific objective evidence ("VSOE") of fair value. In the absence of fair value for a delivered element, HP first allocates revenue to the fair value of the
undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements. Where the fair value for an undelivered element cannot be determined, HP defers revenue for the delivered elements until the
undelivered elements are delivered or the fair value is determinable for the remaining undelivered elements. HP limits the


amount
of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services or subject to customer-specified return or refund privileges.

Products

Hardware

Under
HP's standard terms and conditions of sale, HP transfers title and risk of loss to the customer at the time product is delivered to the customer and revenue is recognized
accordingly, unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant obligations remain. HP reduces revenue for estimated customer returns, price protection, rebates and other programs offered under
sales agreements established by HP with its distributors and resellers. HP records revenue from the sale of equipment under sales-type leases as product revenue at the inception of the
lease. HP accrues the estimated cost of post-sale obligations, including basic product warranties, based on historical experience at the time HP recognizes revenue.

Software

In
accordance with the specific guidance of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition" where
applicable, the company recognizes revenue from perpetual software licenses at the inception of the license term assuming all revenue recognition criteria have been met. Term based software license
revenue is recognized on a subscription basis over the term of the license entitlement. HP uses the residual
method to allocate revenue to software licenses at the inception of the license term when VSOE of fair value for all undelivered elements exists, such as post-contract support, and all other revenue
recognition criteria have been satisfied. Revenue generated from maintenance and unspecified upgrades or updates on a when-and-if-available basis is recognized over
the period such items are delivered.

Services

HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price support or maintenance contracts, including extended warranty contracts and software post-customer support
contracts, ratably over the contract period and recognizes the costs associated with these contracts as incurred. For time and material contracts, HP recognizes revenue and costs as services are
rendered. HP recognizes revenue from fixed-price consulting arrangements over the contract period on a proportional performance basis, as determined by the relationship of actual labor costs incurred
to date to the estimated total contract labor costs, with estimates regularly revised during the life of the contract. While HP uses the proportional performance basis as its basic accounting policy,
the company uses the completed performance method if reasonable and reliable cost estimates for a project cannot be made. For outsourcing contracts, HP recognizes revenue ratably over the contractual
service period for fixed price contracts and on the output or consumption basis for all other outsourcing contracts. HP recognizes costs associated with outsourcing contracts as incurred, unless such
costs relate to the transition phase of the outsourcing contract, in which case HP generally amortizes those costs over the contractual service period. HP recognizes revenue from operating leases on a
straight-line basis as service revenue over the rental period.

In
addition, under the provisions of Emerging Issues Task Force No. 00-21, "Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables," if the revenue for a delivered item is
not recognized


because
it is not separable from the outsourcing arrangement, then HP also defers the cost of the delivered item. HP recognizes both the revenue and associated cost for the delivered item ratably over
the remaining contractual service period. HP recognizes losses on consulting and outsourcing arrangements in the period that the contractual loss becomes probable and estimable. HP records amounts
invoiced to customers in excess of revenue recognized as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. HP records revenue that is earned and recognized in excess of amounts invoiced
on fixed-price contracts as trade receivables.

Financing Income

Sales-type and direct-financing leases produce financing income, which HP recognizes at consistent rates of return over the lease term.

Shipping and Handling

HP includes costs related to shipping and handling in cost of sales for all periods presented.

Advertising

HP expenses advertising costs as incurred or when the advertising is first run. Such costs totaled approximately $1.1 billion in each of fiscal 2007,
fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005.

Taxes on Earnings

HP recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year the differences are expected to reverse. HP records a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is
more likely than not to be realized.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

HP classifies investments as cash equivalents if the original maturity of an investment is three months or less. Cash and cash equivalents consists primarily of
highly liquid investments in time deposits held in major banks and commercial paper. As of October 31, 2007 and 2006, the carrying value of cash and
cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short period of time to maturity. Interest income was approximately $598 million in fiscal 2007, $623 million in fiscal 2006 and
$424 million in fiscal 2005.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

HP establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts to ensure trade and financing receivables are not overstated due to uncollectibility. HP maintains bad debt
reserves based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, trends in overall weighted-average risk rating of the total portfolio, macroeconomic conditions,
significant one-time events, historical experience and the use of third-party credit risk models that generate quantitative measures of default probabilities based on market factors and
the financial condition of customers. HP records a specific reserve for individual accounts when HP becomes aware of a customer's inability to meet its financial obligations, such as in the case of
bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer's operating results or financial position.


If
circumstances related to customers change, HP would further adjust estimates of the recoverability of receivables.

Inventory

HP values inventory at the lower of cost or market, with cost computed on a first-in, first-out basis.

Fixed Assets

HP states property, plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation. HP capitalizes additions and improvements. HP expenses maintenance and repairs as
incurred. HP provides depreciation using straight-line or accelerated methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives are 5 to 40 years for buildings
and improvements and 3 to 15 years for machinery and equipment. HP depreciates leasehold improvements over the life of the lease or the asset, whichever is shorter. HP depreciates equipment
held for lease over the initial term of the lease to the equipment's estimated residual value.

HP
capitalizes certain internal and external costs incurred to acquire or create internal use software, principally related to software coding, designing system interfaces and
installation and testing of the software. HP amortizes capitalized costs using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally from three to five years.

Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets

Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"), prohibits the amortization of
goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. HP reviews goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually at the beginning of its fourth
fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS 142. For goodwill, HP performs a
two-step impairment test. In the first step, HP compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. HP determines the fair value of its reporting units based on a
weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income approach, HP calculates the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Under the market
approach, HP estimates the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets
assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting
unit, then HP must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill
exceeds its implied fair value, HP records an impairment loss equal to the difference.

SFAS 142
also requires that the fair value of the indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets be estimated and compared to the carrying value. HP estimates the fair value of
these intangible assets using an income approach. HP recognizes an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived purchased intangible assets is less than the carrying value.


Long-Lived Assets Including Finite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets

HP amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging
from one to ten years.

HP
evaluates long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets with finite lives, for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets." HP
assesses the fair value of the assets based on the undiscounted future cash flow the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow
expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When HP identifies an impairment, HP
reduces the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach or, when available and appropriate, to comparable market values.

Derivative Financial Instruments

HP uses derivative financial instruments, primarily forwards, swaps, and options, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. HP also may use
other derivative instruments not designated as hedges such as forwards used to hedge foreign currency balance sheet exposures. HP does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative
purposes. See Note 9 for a full description of HP's derivative financial instrument activities and related accounting policies, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Investments

HP's investments consist principally of time deposits, commercial paper, corporate debt, other debt securities, and equity securities of publicly-traded and
privately-held companies. HP classifies investments with maturities of less than one year as short-term investments.

HP
classifies its investments in debt securities and its equity investments in public companies as available-for-sale securities and carries them at fair value.
HP determines fair values for investments in public companies using quoted market prices. HP records the unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, net of
taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

HP
carries equity investments in privately-held companies at the lower of cost or fair value. HP may estimate fair values for investments in privately-held
companies based upon one or more of the following: pricing models using historical and forecasted financial information
and current market rates; liquidation values; the values of recent rounds of financing; and quoted market prices of comparable public companies.

Losses on Investments

HP monitors its investment portfolio for impairment on a periodic basis. In the event that the carrying value of an investment exceeds its fair value and the
decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, HP records an impairment charge and establishes a new cost basis for the investment at its current fair value. In order to determine whether
a decline in value is other than temporary, HP evaluates, among other factors: the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than the


carrying
value; the financial condition of and business outlook for the company or financial institution, including key operational and cash flow metrics, current market conditions and future trends
in the issuer's industry; the company's relative competitive position within the industry; and HP's intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in fair value.

HP
determined the declines in value of certain investments to be other than temporary. Accordingly, HP recorded impairments of approximately $28 million in fiscal 2007,
$8 million in fiscal 2006 and $43 million in fiscal 2005. HP includes these impairments in gains (losses) on investments in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Depending on market
conditions, HP may record additional impairments on its investment portfolio in the future.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject HP to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents, investments,
accounts receivable from trade customers and from contract manufacturers, financing receivables and derivatives.

HP
maintains cash and cash equivalents, short and long-term investments, derivatives and certain other financial instruments with various financial institutions. These
financial institutions are located in many different geographical regions and HP's policy is designed to limit exposure with any one institution. As part of its cash and risk management processes, HP
performs periodic
evaluations of the relative credit standing of the financial institutions. HP has not sustained material credit losses from instruments held at financial institutions. HP utilizes forward contracts
and other derivative contracts to protect against the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Such contracts involve the risk of non-performance by the counterparty, which could result
in a material loss.

HP
sells a significant portion of its products through third-party distributors and resellers and, as a result, maintains individually significant receivable balances with these parties.
If the financial condition or operations of these distributors and resellers deteriorate substantially, HP's operating results could be adversely affected. The ten largest distributor and reseller
receivable balances collectively, which were concentrated primarily in North America, represented approximately 23% of gross accounts receivable at October 31, 2007 and 21% at
October 31, 2006. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of accounts receivable. Credit risk with respect to other accounts receivable and financing receivables is generally diversified
due to the large number of entities comprising HP's customer base and their dispersion across many different industries and geographical regions. HP performs ongoing credit evaluations of the
financial condition of its third-party distributors, resellers and other customers and requires collateral, such as letters of credit and bank guarantees, in certain circumstances. To ensure a
receivable balance is not overstated due to uncollectibility, an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained as required under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The past due or
delinquency status of a receivable is based on the contractual payment terms of the receivable. The need to write off a receivable balance depends on the age, size and a determination of
collectibility of the receivable. HP generally has experienced longer accounts receivable collection cycles in its emerging markets, in particular Asia Pacific and Latin America, compared to its
United States and European markets. In the event that accounts receivable collection cycles in emerging markets significantly deteriorate or one or more of HP's larger resellers in these regions fail,
HP's operating results could be adversely affected.


Other Concentration

HP obtains a significant number of components from single source suppliers due to technology, availability, price, quality or other considerations. The loss of a
single source supplier, the deterioration of its relationship with a single source supplier, or any unilateral modification to the contractual terms under which HP is supplied components by a single
source supplier could adversely effect HP's revenue and gross margins.

Stock-Based Compensation

Effective November 1, 2005, HP adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), "Share-Based Payment"
("SFAS 123R"), using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated results for prior periods. Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense in
fiscal 2006 included stock-based compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of November 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair
value estimated in accordance with the original provision of SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation" ("SFAS 123"). Stock-based compensation expense for all share-based
payment awards granted after November 1, 2005 is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. HP recognizes these compensation
costs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term of four years. Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, HP
recognized stock-based compensation expense in accordance with Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). In March 2005,
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 ("SAB 107") regarding the SEC's interpretation of SFAS 123R and the valuation of
share-based payments for public companies. HP has applied the provisions of SAB 107 in its adoption of SFAS 123R.

In
November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Staff Position ("FSP") No. FAS 123(R)-3, "Transition Election Related to Accounting for
Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards" ("FSP 123R-3"). HP has elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FSP 123R-3 for calculating the tax
effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123R. The alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in
capital pool ("APIC pool") related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of the tax
effects of employee stock-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of SFAS 123R. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on
stock-based compensation.

Foreign Currency Transactions

HP uses the U.S. dollar predominately as its functional currency. Assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollars are remeasured
into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities, and historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets and liabilities. Net revenue, cost of sales and expenses
are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those net revenue, cost of sales and expenses related to the previously noted balance sheet amounts, which HP
remeasures at historical exchange rates. HP includes gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement in net earnings. Certain foreign subsidiaries designate the local


currency
as their functional currency, and HP records the translation of their assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars at the balance sheet dates as translation adjustments and includes them
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

Retirement and Post-Retirement Plans

HP has various defined benefit, other contributory and noncontributory retirement and post-retirement plans. HP generally amortizes unrecognized
actuarial gains and losses on a straight-line basis over the remaining estimated service life of participants. The measurement date for all plans is September 30 for fiscal 2007 and
fiscal 2006. See Note 15 for a full description of these plans and the accounting and funding policies, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Recent Pronouncements

In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an
interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109" ("FIN 48"). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required
to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and
transition. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is required to be adopted by HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. The cumulative effects of
applying FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Additionally, in May 2007, the FASB published FASB Staff Position No.
FIN 48-1, "Definition
of Settlement in FASB Interpretation No. 48" ("FSP FIN 48-1"). FSP FIN 48-1 is an amendment to FIN 48. It clarifies how an enterprise should determine whether a tax
position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits. FSP FIN 48-1 is effective upon the initial adoption of FIN 48, and therefore will be
adopted by HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. While HP is still evaluating the impact of adoption of FIN 48 and FSP FIN 48-1 on its consolidated financial statements, it is
estimated that the adoption of FIN 48 and FSP FIN 48-1 will result in a net increase to retained earnings in the range of $500 million to $900 million. This estimate is
subject to revision as management completes its analysis.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements" ("SFAS 157"). SFAS 157 provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and
liabilities. It also responds to investors' requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value, the information used to measure fair
value, and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings. SFAS 157 applies whenever other standards require (or permit) assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value, and does not
expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be
adopted by HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. HP is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial
condition and is not yet in a position to determine such effects.

In
September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, "Employers' Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans—An Amendment of FASB No. 87,
88, 106 and 132(R)" ("SFAS 158"). SFAS 158 requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the company's balance sheet and changes in the funded
status be reflected in


comprehensive
income, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, which HP adopted during fiscal 2007. See Note 15 for the effect of applying this provision on the
consolidated financial statements. SFAS 158 also requires companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of their fiscal year end, effective for fiscal years ending after
December 15, 2008. HP expects to adopt the measurement provisions of SFAS 158 effective October 31, 2009.

In
February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, "The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an amendment of FASB Statement
No. 115" ("SFAS 159"). SFAS 159 expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value.
Under SFAS 159, a company may elect to use fair value to measure accounts and loans receivable, available-for-sale and held-to-maturity
securities, equity method investments, accounts payable, guarantees and issued debt. Other eligible items include firm commitments for financial instruments that otherwise would not be recognized at
inception and non-cash warranty obligations where a warrantor is permitted to pay a third party to provide the warranty goods or services. If the use of fair value is elected, any upfront
costs and fees related to the item must be recognized in earnings and cannot be deferred, such as debt issuance costs. The fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an
instrument-by-instrument basis, even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value. At the adoption date,
unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings. Subsequent to the adoption of
SFAS 159, changes in fair value are recognized in earnings. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007 and is required to be adopted by HP in the
first quarter of fiscal 2009. HP currently is determining whether fair value accounting is appropriate for any of its eligible items and cannot estimate the impact, if any, that SFAS 159 will
have on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In
June 2007, the FASB also ratified EITF 07-3, "Accounting for Nonrefundable Advance Payments for Goods or Services Received for Use in Future Research and Development
Activities" ("EITF 07-3"). EITF 07-3 requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and
development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed. EITF 07-3 is effective, on a
prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007 and will be adopted by HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. HP does not expect the adoption of
EITF 07-3 to have a material effect on HP's consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141R"). SFAS 141R establishes principles and requirements for how an
acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired.
SFAS 141R also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141R is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2008, and will be adopted by HP in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. HP is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS 141R on
its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In
December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, "Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements—an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin
No. 51" ("SFAS 160"). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by


parties
other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parent's ownership interest, and the valuation of
retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of
the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008, and will be adopted by HP in the first quarter of
fiscal 2010. HP is currently evaluating the potential impact, if any, of the adoption of SFAS 160 on its consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In
addition to the SFAS 158 adoption mentioned above, HP adopted the following accounting standards in fiscal 2007, none of which had a material effect on HP's consolidated
results of operations during such period or financial condition at the end of such period:

•

SFAS
No. 154, "Accounting for Changes and Error Corrections";

•

Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 108, "Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements";

•

EITF
05-5, "Accounting for Early Retirement or Postemployment Programs with Specific Features (Such as Terms Specified in Altersteilzeit Early Retirement
Arrangements)"; and

•

EITF
06-9, "Reporting a Change in (or the Elimination of) a Previously Existing Difference between the Fiscal Year End of a Parent Company and That of a
Consolidated Entity or between the Reporting Period of an Investor and That of an Equity Method Investee."

Note 2: Stock-Based Compensation

At October 31, 2007, HP has the stock-based employee compensation plans described below. The total compensation expense before taxes related to these plans
was $629 million and $536 million for fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Prior
to November 1, 2005, HP accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of APB 25. Accordingly, HP generally recognized stock-based
compensation expense only when it granted options with a discounted exercise price. Any resulting compensation expense was recognized ratably over the associated service period, which was generally
the option vesting term. Prior to November 1, 2005, HP also provided pro forma disclosure amounts in accordance with SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation—Transition and Disclosure" ("SFAS 148"), as if the fair value method defined by SFAS 123 had been applied to its stock-based compensation.

Effective
November 1, 2005, HP adopted the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R, using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated
prior periods' results. Under this transition method, stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2006 included compensation expense for all share-based payment awards granted prior to, but not yet
vested as of, November 1, 2005, based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of SFAS 123. Stock-based compensation expense for all
share-based payment awards granted after November 1, 2005 is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of SFAS 123R. HP recognizes these
compensation costs net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes the compensation costs for only those shares expected to vest on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term of four years. HP estimated the


forfeiture
rates in fiscal 2007 and 2006 based on its historical experience for fiscal grant years where the majority of the vesting terms have been satisfied.

As
a result of adopting SFAS 123R, earnings before income taxes and net earnings in fiscal 2007 were lower by $494 million and $353 million, respectively, than if we
had continued to account for stock-based compensation under APB 25. The unfavorable impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 was $0.13 per share. Earnings before
income taxes and net earnings in fiscal 2006 were lower by $448 million and $318 million, respectively, as a result of adopting SFAS 123R. The unfavorable impact on both basic and
diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006 was $0.11 per share. In addition, prior to the adoption of SFAS 123R, HP presented the tax benefit of stock option exercises as operating cash flows.
Upon the adoption of SFAS 123R, the tax benefit resulting from tax deductions in excess of the tax benefit related to compensation cost recognized for those options is classified as financing
cash flows.

The
pro forma table below reflects net earnings and basic and diluted net earnings per share for the following fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, if HP had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS 123:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

HP sponsors the Hewlett-Packard Company 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, also known as the Share Ownership Plan (the "ESPP"), pursuant to which eligible
employees may contribute up to 10% of base compensation, subject to certain income limits, to purchase shares of HP's common stock. Prior to November 1, 2005, employees were able to purchase
stock semi-annually at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value at certain plan-defined dates. As of November 1, 2005, HP changed the ESPP so that employees will
purchase stock semi-annually at a price equal to 85% of the fair market value on the purchase date. Since the price of the shares is now determined at the purchase date and there is no
longer a look-back period, HP recognizes the expense based on the 15% discount at


purchase.
In fiscal 2007, ESPP compensation expense was $56 million, net of taxes. At October 31, 2007, approximately 161,000 employees were eligible to participate and approximately
51,000 employees were participants in the ESPP. In fiscal 2006, ESPP compensation expense was $53 million, net of taxes. At October 31, 2006, approximately 147,000 employees were
eligible to participate and approximately 53,000 employees were participants in the ESPP. In fiscal 2007, participants purchased approximately 8,744,000 shares of HP common stock at a weighted-average
price of $39 per share. In fiscal 2006, participants purchased approximately 11,076,000 shares of HP common stock at a weighted-average price of $30 per share. In fiscal 2005, participants purchased
approximately 20,673,000 shares of HP common stock at a weighted-average price of $17 per share.

Incentive Compensation Plans

HP stock option plans include principal plans adopted in 2004, 2000, 1995 and 1990 ("principal option plans"), as well as various stock option plans assumed
through acquisitions under which stock options are outstanding. All regular employees meeting certain employment qualifications were eligible to receive stock options in fiscal 2007. There were
approximately 99,000 employees holding options under one or more of the option plans as of October 31, 2007. Options granted under the principal option plans are generally
non-qualified stock options, but the principal option plans permit some options granted to qualify as "incentive stock options" under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The exercise
price of a stock option is equal to the fair market value of HP's common stock on the option grant date (as determined by the average of the highest and lowest reported sale prices of HP's common
stock on that date). The contractual term of options granted since fiscal 2003 was generally eight years, while the contractual term of options granted prior to fiscal 2003 was generally ten years.
Under the principal option plans, HP may choose, in certain cases, to establish a discounted exercise price at no less than 75% of fair market value on the grant date. HP has not granted any
discounted options since fiscal 2003.

Under
the principal option plans, HP granted certain employees cash, restricted stock awards, or both. Restricted stock awards are nonvested stock awards that may include grants of
restricted stock or grants of restricted stock units. Cash and restricted stock awards are independent of option grants and are generally subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to the
release of the restrictions. Such awards generally vest one to three years from the date of grant. During that period, ownership of the shares cannot be transferred. Restricted stock has the same cash
dividend and voting rights as other common stock and is considered to be currently issued and outstanding. Restricted stock units have dividend equivalent rights equal to the cash dividend paid on
restricted stock. Restricted stock units do not have the voting rights of common stock, and the shares underlying the restricted stock units are not considered issued and outstanding. HP expenses the
cost of the restricted stock awards, which HP has determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse. In fiscal
2007, HP granted 1,469,000 shares of restricted stock with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $43. In fiscal 2006, HP granted 1,492,000 shares of restricted stock with a weighted-average
grant date fair value of $32. In fiscal 2005, HP granted 6,773,000 shares of restricted stock with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $21. HP had 4,763,000 shares of restricted stock
outstanding at October 31, 2007, 5,492,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding at October 31, 2006 and 7,099,000 shares of restricted stock outstanding at October 31, 2005. In
fiscal 2007, HP granted 151,000 shares of restricted stock units with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $45. In fiscal 2006, HP granted 33,000 shares of restricted stock units with a


weighted-average
grant date fair value of $30. In fiscal 2005, HP granted 1,820,000 shares of restricted stock units with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $21. HP had restricted stock units
covering approximately 935,000 shares outstanding at October 31, 2007, 873,000 shares outstanding at October 31, 2006 and 1,780,000 shares outstanding at October 31, 2005.

In
light of new accounting guidance under SFAS 123R, beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2005 HP reevaluated its assumptions used in estimating the fair value of employee
options granted. As part of this assessment, management determined that implied volatility calculated based on actively traded options on HP common stock is a better indicator of expected
volatility and future stock price trends than historical volatility. Therefore, expected volatility in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was based on a market-based implied volatility.

As
part of its SFAS 123R adoption, HP also examined its historical pattern of option exercises in an effort to determine if there were any discernable activity patterns based on
certain employee populations. From this analysis, HP identified three employee populations. HP used the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the options for each of the employee populations.
The table below presents the weighted-average expected life in months of the combined three identified employee populations. The expected life computation is based on historical exercise patterns and
post-vesting termination behavior within each of the three populations identified. The risk-free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on
the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

The
fair value of share-based payment awards was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions and weighted-average fair values:

stock price on the last trading day of fiscal 2007 and fiscal 2006 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by
the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on October 31, 2007 and 2006. This amount changes based on the fair market value of HP's stock. Total intrinsic value of
options exercised in fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $2.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. Total fair value of options vested and expensed in fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $297 million
and $265 million, respectively, net of taxes.

restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.46 years.

HP
recorded $84 million, $58 million and $144 million of stock-based compensation expense, net of taxes, relating to options assumed through acquisitions and
restricted stock awards in fiscal 2007, 2006, and 2005 respectively.

Total
stock-based compensation expense before taxes in fiscal 2007 excludes a $14 million credit adjustment in restructuring charges associated with the fiscal 2005 restructuring
plan and a $29 million restructuring charge for accelerating the vesting of options held by those employees who elected to participate in the 2007 EER. In fiscal 2005, as part of its fiscal
2005 restructuring plans, HP accelerated the vesting on options held by terminated employees and included a one-year post-termination exercise period on the options. This
modification resulted in compensation expense of $107 million that HP included in the restructuring charges. In fiscal 2006, an adjustment of $14 million was recorded as a reduction to
the $107 million in restructuring charges to reflect actual stock-based compensation expense related to employees who left the company.

Stock-based
compensation expense recognized under incentive compensation plans was approximately $644 million in fiscal 2007 (including the $14 million credit adjustment in
restructuring charges and a $29 million charge for accelerating the vesting of options held by those employees who elected to participate in the 2007 EER, both referred to above)
$522 million in fiscal 2006 (including the $14 million credit in restructuring charges referred to above), and $211 million in fiscal 2005 (including the $107 million in
restructuring charges referred to above).

Shares Reserved

Shares available for future grant under the ESPP and stock-based compensation plans were 181,704,000 at October 31, 2007, including 45,312,000 shares under
the assumed Compaq plans; 217,556,000 at October 31, 2006, including 39,151,000 shares under the assumed Compaq plans; and 260,669,000 at October 31, 2005, including 32,449,000 shares
under the assumed Compaq plans.


HP
had 549,045,000 shares of common stock reserved at October 31, 2007, 664,267,000 shares of common stock reserved at October 31, 2006, and 794,750,000 shares of common
stock reserved at October 31, 2005 for future issuance under all stock-related benefit plans. Additionally, HP had
21,494,000 shares of common stock reserved at each of October 31, 2007, October 31, 2006 and October 31, 2005 for future issuances related to conversion of its outstanding
zero-coupon subordinated notes.

Note 3: Net Earnings Per Share

HP calculates basic earnings per share ("EPS") using net earnings and the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS
includes the effect from potential issuance of common stock, such as stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of stock options and the assumed conversion of convertible notes.

The
reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted EPS calculations was as follows for the following fiscal years ended October 31:

HP
excludes options with exercise prices that are greater than the average market price from the calculation of diluted EPS because their effect would be anti-dilutive. In
fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, HP excluded 60 million shares, 130 million shares and 255 million shares, respectively, from its diluted EPS calculation. Also, as a result of adopting
SFAS 123R on November 1, 2005, HP excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS options to purchase an additional 33 million shares and 48 million shares in fiscal 2007 and
fiscal 2006, respectively, whose combined exercise price, unamortized fair value and excess tax benefits were greater in each of those periods than the average market price for HP's common stock, as
their effect would be anti-dilutive. In addition, HP excluded approximately 8 million


shares
of HP stock issuable upon the assumed conversion of zero-coupon subordinated notes from the calculation of diluted EPS in fiscal 2005 because the effect was
anti-dilutive.

integration projects, product sales and leasing income. The fixed-price support or maintenance contracts include stand-alone product support packages, routine maintenance service contracts, upgrades
or extensions to standard product warranty, as well as high availability services for complex, global, networked, multi-vendor environments. HP defers these service amounts at the time HP bills the
customer, and HP then recognizes the amounts ratably over the contract life or as HP renders the services.

Note 6: Acquisitions

HP has recorded all acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly, included the results of operations in HP's consolidated results as of
the date of each acquisition. HP allocates the purchase price of its acquisitions to the tangible assets, liabilities and intangible assets acquired, including in-process research & development
("IPR&D") charges, based on their estimated fair values. The excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to assets acquired is based on valuations
using management's estimates and assumptions. HP does not expect goodwill recorded on a majority of these acquisitions to be deductible for tax purposes. HP has not presented pro forma results of
operations because these acquisitions are not material to HP's consolidated results of operations on either an individual or an aggregate basis.

Mercury Acquisition

On November 2, 2006, HP completed its tender offer for Mercury Interactive Corporation ("Mercury"), a leading IT management software and services company,
and acquired approximately 96% of Mercury common shares for cash consideration of $52 per share. On November 6, 2006, HP acquired the remaining outstanding common shares, and Mercury became a
wholly owned subsidiary of HP. This acquisition combines Mercury's application management, application delivery and IT governance capabilities with HP's broad portfolio of management solutions.

The
aggregate purchase price of approximately $4.9 billion consisted of cash paid for outstanding stock, vested in-the-money stock options and direct
transaction costs. In addition, the purchase price


also
included the estimated fair value of earned unvested stock options and out-of-the-money vested stock options assumed by HP.

Based
on valuations prepared using estimates and assumptions provided by management, the purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition has been allocated as follows:

Opsware Acquisition

On September 17, 2007, HP completed its tender offer for Opsware Inc. ("Opsware"), a leader in data center automation, and acquired more than 90% of
Opsware's common shares for cash consideration of $14.25 per share. On September 21, 2007, HP acquired all remaining outstanding Opsware shares and Opsware became a wholly owned subsidiary of
HP which will be included in the HP Software segment.

The
aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.7 billion consisted of cash paid for outstanding stock, vested in-the-money stock options and direct
transaction costs. In addition, the purchase price also included the estimated fair value of earned unvested stock options and out-of-the-money vested stock options
assumed by HP. In connection with this acquisition, HP recorded approximately


$1.3 billion
of goodwill and $249 million of amortizable intangible assets. HP is amortizing the purchased intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated lives
ranging from five to six years. HP did not record any IPR&D in connection with the Opsware acquisition.

Other Acquisitions in fiscal 2007

HP also completed eight other acquisitions during fiscal 2007. Total consideration for these acquisitions was approximately $1.0 billion, which included
direct transaction costs, the estimated fair value of earned unvested stock options and certain liabilities recorded in connection with these acquisitions. The largest of these transactions was the
acquisition of Neoware, Inc., which HP expects to further its leadership in personal computing by accelerating HP's thin client portfolio.

HP
recorded approximately $700 million of goodwill and $182 million of purchased intangibles in connection with these other acquisitions. HP also recorded approximately
$9 million of IPR&D related to these acquisitions in fiscal 2007. Projects that qualify for treatment as IPR&D have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative use.

HP
has included the results of operations of these transactions prospectively from the respective date of the transaction.

Pending and Subsequent Acquisitions

In November 2007, HP agreed to acquire EYP Mission Critical Facilities Inc., a consulting company specializing in strategic technology planning,
design and operations support for large-scale data centers. The transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and is expected to be completed during HP's first quarter of fiscal 2008. Upon
completion, the business is expected to be fully integrated into HP Services.

In
November 2007, HP completed the acquisition of MacDermid ColorSpan Inc., a privately held manufacturer of wide-format digital inkjet printers. The business
is being integrated into HP's Imaging and Printing Group.

In
November 2007, HP completed the acquisition of Atos Origin Middle East Group, one of the Middle East's leading systems integrators. The business is being integrated into HP
Services.

In
December 2007, HP agreed to acquire NUR Macroprinters Ltd., a maker of industrial wide-format digital inkjet printers. This transaction is subject to certain closing conditions and is
expected to be completed during HP's second quarter of fiscal 2008. Upon completion, the business is expected to be fully integrated into HP's Imaging and Printing Group.

Acquisitions in fiscal 2006

Peregrine

On December 19, 2005, HP acquired the outstanding shares of Peregrine Systems, Inc. ("Peregrine") in a cash merger for $26.08 per share. The
purchase price was approximately $538 million, consisting of $442 million of cash paid, which includes direct transaction costs, as well as the assumption of certain liabilities in
connection with the transaction. The acquisition of Peregrine added key asset and service management components to the HP OpenView portfolio, a distributed management software suite for business
operations and IT. In connection with this acquisition, HP


recorded
approximately $342 million of goodwill and $162 million of amortizable intangible assets. HP also expensed $34 million for IPR&D. HP is amortizing the purchased
intangibles, principally customer relationships and developed technology, on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives ranging from five to six years.

Other Acquisitions in fiscal 2006

HP also completed seven other acquisitions during fiscal 2006. Total consideration for these acquisitions and the buyout of a minority interest was approximately
$473 million, which included direct transaction costs. The largest of these transactions was the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Scitex Vision Ltd ("Scitex"). The
Scitex asset acquisition expanded HP's leadership in printing into the industrial wide-format market.

HP
recorded approximately $193 million of goodwill and $205 million of purchased intangibles in connection with these other acquisitions. HP also recorded approximately
$18 million of IPR&D related to these acquisitions in fiscal 2006.

In
addition, HP paid approximately $17 million for the balance of the outstanding shares of Digital Globalsoft Limited, a consolidated subsidiary of HP ("DGS"), and as a result
increased HP's ownership from 98.5% to 100%. This subsidiary has enhanced HP's capability in IT services, including expertise in life cycle services such as migration, technical and application
services.

HP
has included the results of operations of these transactions prospectively from the respective date of the transaction. HP has not presented the pro forma results of operations of the
acquired businesses because the results are not material to HP's results of operations on either an individual or an aggregate basis.

Note 7: Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

The
goodwill adjustments relate primarily to the reversal of income tax reserves of Compaq Computer Corporation ("Compaq"), which HP acquired in 2002, for pre-acquisition tax
years. These tax years have been audited and agreed upon with the Internal Revenue Service and the statute of


limitations
for them has expired. Accordingly, the reserves have been reclassified as a reduction of goodwill.

Based
on the results of its annual impairment tests, HP determined that no impairment of goodwill existed as of August 1, 2007 or August 1, 2006. However, future goodwill
impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. HP will continue to evaluate goodwill on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events and changes in
circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment.

on the results of its annual impairment tests, HP determined that no impairment of the Compaq trade name existed as of August 1, 2007 or August 1, 2006. However,
future impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings. HP will continue to evaluate the purchased intangible asset with an indefinite life on an annual basis as of the beginning of its fourth
fiscal quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there may be a potential impairment.

The
finite-lived purchased intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer lists and distribution agreements, which have weighted-average useful lives of approximately eight
years, and developed and core technology, patents and product trademarks, which have weighted-average useful lives of approximately six years.

Note 8: Restructuring Charges

Fiscal 2007 U.S. Enhanced Early Retirement Program

In the second quarter of fiscal 2007, HP announced that it was offering eligible employees an option to participate in the 2007 EER. The 2007 EER
was open to employees who satisfied defined eligibility criteria based on combined age and years of service as well as to otherwise eligible employees who had been included in previous restructuring
programs or who voluntarily left the company since November 30, 2006. A total of 3,080 employees participated in the 2007 EER, including 595 persons who had been included in previous
restructuring programs or who had voluntarily left the company since November 30, 2006. All participating employees left the company by May 31, 2007. HP recorded a net restructuring
charge of $354 million in fiscal 2007 in connection with the 2007 EER. This charge reflected $367 million of severance and benefits cost for the participating employees,
$29 million of stock-based compensation expense for accelerating the vesting of options held by participating employees and $2 million of outplacement costs. These charges were partially
offset by a $28 million settlement gain from HP's U.S. pension plan and a $16 million curtailment gain from its U.S. post-retirement benefit plans. The net
restructuring charge of $354 million for the 2007 EER program was subsequently offset by a $542 million curtailment gain that HP recognized in fiscal 2007, resulting from changes
in the U.S. defined benefit pension and post-retirement plans that HP also announced in the second quarter of 2007. HP funded the cash expenditures associated with the
2007 EER primarily by using available U.S. pension plan assets. For more information, see Note 15, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Fiscal 2007 Mercury Plan

In connection with the acquisition of Mercury, HP's management approved and initiated plans to restructure the operations of Mercury to eliminate certain
duplicative activities, reduce the cost structure and better align product and operating expenses with existing general economic conditions. During fiscal 2007, HP recorded $45 million in
severance-related costs associated with the initial estimate of the elimination of approximately 370 positions primarily in the United States and in Europe. HP eliminated substantially all of these
positions and paid the majority of the related severance payments in fiscal 2007.


During
fiscal 2007, HP also recorded a total cost of $13 million related to exiting duplicative leased facilities. HP expects to pay the costs for exiting the facilities through
2014.

All
Mercury restructuring costs are reflected in the purchase price of Mercury in accordance with EITF 95-3, "Recognition of Liabilities in Connection with a Purchase
Business Combination." These costs are subject to change based on the actual costs incurred. Changes to these estimates could increase or decrease the amount of the purchase price allocated to
goodwill.

Fiscal 2005 Restructuring Plans

In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, HP's Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan designed to simplify HP's structure, reduce costs and place greater
focus on its customers. At that time, HP estimated that it would eliminate 15,300 positions in connection with the restructuring plan. Subsequent to the initial estimate, HP reduced the number of
total positions to 14,985. As of October 31, 2007, HP had substantially completed eliminating these positions. The initial charge for these actions totaled $1.6 billion. During fiscal
2007, HP recognized a net $46 million reduction recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007, which included severance adjustments for employees whose positions HP eliminated but who found
other positions within HP, a $14 million non-cash stock-based compensation expense adjustment, and a $9 million curtailment gain relating to the HP subsidized U.S. retiree
medical program. This net reduction was offset by $46 million of higher employee severance and other benefit charges than originally estimated. HP had paid the majority of the costs related to
severance and other employee benefits as of October 31, 2007 and expects to pay out the remaining costs associated primarily with tax payments for early retirees through fiscal 2018.

In
the third quarter of fiscal 2005, HP's management approved a restructuring plan and HP recorded restructuring charges of $109 million related to severance and related costs
associated with the termination of approximately 1,450 employees, all of whom left HP as of October 31, 2005. HP paid all of the costs associated with the restructuring plan as of
January 31, 2007.

Fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001 Restructuring Plans

The 2003, 2002 and 2001 restructuring plans are substantially complete, although HP records minor revisions to previous estimates as necessary. In fiscal 2007, HP
recorded an adjustment of $33 million in additional restructuring charges relating primarily to facility lease obligations. As of October 31, 2007, the aggregate $69 million
outstanding restructuring liability with respect to these plans relates primarily to facility lease obligations. HP expects to pay the majority of these obligations over the lives of the related
obligations, which extend to the end of fiscal 2010.

Workforce Rebalancing

As part of our ongoing business operations, HP incurs workforce rebalancing charges for severance and related costs within certain business segments. Workforce
rebalancing activities are considered part of normal operations as HP continues to optimize our cost structure. Workforce rebalancing costs are included in HP's business segment results, and HP
expects to incur additional workforce rebalancing costs in the future.


Summary of Restructuring Plans

Time
deposits consist of certificate of deposits with maturity dates greater than three months. Commercial paper investments include asset-backed commercial paper. Corporate debt
consists primarily of loans to the other companies that are guaranteed by standby letters of credit issued by third-party banks. Other debt securities consist primarily of fixed-interest securities
invested for early retirement purposes. Equity securities in public companies are primarily common stock.

HP
estimated the fair values based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates. These estimated fair values may not be representative of actual values that could
have been realized as of year-end or that will be realized in the future.

The
gross unrealized losses as of October 31, 2007 were associated with other debt securities with a fair value of $20 million that had been in a continuous loss position
for 12 months or longer. The gross unrealized losses were due primarily to changes in interest rates. Because HP has the intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time
sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in fair value, HP does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of October 31, 2007. The
gross unrealized losses as of October 31, 2006 were associated with other debt securities with a fair value of $18 million and had been in a continuous loss position for fewer than
12 months.

respectively, in fiscal 2006. The gross realized gains and losses totaled $31 million and $1 million, respectively, in fiscal 2005. The specific identification method is used to account
for gains and losses on available-for-sale securities.

securities in privately-held companies include cost basis and equity method investments. Other investments consist primarily of marketable trading securities held to
generate returns that HP expects to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements. HP includes gains or losses from changes in fair value of these securities,
offset by losses or gains on the related liabilities, in interest and other, net, in HP's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. The gains or losses associated with these securities are not material for
both fiscal years 2007 and 2006.

Derivative Financial Instruments

HP is a global company that is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and interest rate changes in the normal course of its business. As part of
its risk management strategy, HP uses derivative instruments, primarily forward contracts, swaps and options, to hedge certain foreign currency and interest rate exposures. HP's objective is to offset
gains and losses resulting from these exposures with losses and gains on the derivative contracts used to hedge them, thereby reducing volatility of earnings or protecting fair values of assets and
liabilities. HP does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes. HP applies hedge accounting based upon the criteria established by SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities" ("SFAS 133"), whereby HP designates its derivatives as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in
a foreign operation ("net investment hedges"). HP recognizes all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and reports them in other current assets, long-term financing
receivables and other assets, other accrued liabilities, and other liabilities. HP classifies cash flows from the derivative programs as cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

Fair Value Hedges

HP may enter into fair value hedges to reduce the exposure of its debt portfolio to both interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. HP issues
long-term debt in either U.S. dollars or foreign currencies based on market conditions at the time of financing. HP may then use interest rate or cross currency swaps to modify the market
risk exposures in connection with the debt to achieve primarily U.S. dollar LIBOR-based floating interest expense and to manage exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The swap
transactions generally involve the exchange of fixed for


floating
interest payments, and, when the underlying debt is denominated in a foreign currency, exchange of the foreign currency principal and interest obligations for U.S. dollar-denominated amounts.
Alternatively, HP may choose not to swap fixed for floating interest payments or may terminate a previously executed swap if it believes a larger proportion of fixed-rate debt would be
beneficial. HP may choose not to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with its foreign currency denominated debt if this debt acts as a natural hedge for foreign currency assets denominated in
the same currency. When investing in fixed rate instruments, HP may enter into interest rate swaps that convert the fixed interest returns into variable interest returns and would classify these swaps
as fair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, HP recognizes the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, as well as the offsetting loss or
gain on the hedged item in interest and other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the current period. When HP terminates an interest rate swap before maturity, the resulting gain or
loss from the termination is amortized over the remaining life of the underlying hedged item.

Cash Flow Hedges

HP may use cash flow hedges to hedge the variability of LIBOR-based interest income HP receives on certain variable-rate investments. HP may enter
into interest rate swaps that convert variable rate interest returns into fixed-rate interest returns. For interest rate swaps that HP designates and that qualify as cash flow hedges, HP
records changes in the fair values in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders' equity and subsequently reclassifies such changes into earnings in the period
during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings.

HP
uses a combination of forward contracts and options designated as cash flow hedges to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risks inherent in its forecasted net revenue
and, to a lesser extent, cost of sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. HP's foreign currency cash flow hedges mature generally within six months. However, certain leasing
revenue-related forward
contracts extend for the duration of the lease term, which can be up to five years. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, HP initially records the effective
portions of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a separate component of stockholders' equity and subsequently reclassifies these amounts into
earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. HP reports the effective portion of cash flow hedges in the same financial statement line item as the changes in
value of the hedged item. As of October 31, 2007, amounts related to derivatives qualifying as cash flow hedges amounted to an accumulated other comprehensive loss of $64 million, net of
taxes, of which $63 million HP expects to reclassify to earnings in the next 12 months along with the earnings effects of the related forecasted transactions. In addition, during fiscal
2007 and 2006 HP did not discontinue any cash flow hedges for which it was probable that a forecasted transaction would not occur.

Net Investment Hedges

HP uses forward contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local
currency. For derivative instruments that are designated as net investment hedges, HP records the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument together with changes in the hedged
items in cumulative translation adjustment as a separate component of stockholders' equity. Cumulative translation adjustment decreased as result of


an
unrecognized net loss on net investment hedges of $109 million and $31 million for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

Other Derivatives

Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133 consist primarily of forward contracts HP uses to hedge foreign currency balance
sheet exposures. For derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments under SFAS 133, HP recognizes changes in the fair values in earnings in the period of change. HP recognizes the
gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts used to hedge balance sheet exposures in interest and other, net in the same period as the remeasurement gain and loss of the related foreign
currency denominated assets and liabilities. Interest and other, net, included net foreign currency exchange gains of approximately $86 million in fiscal 2007, gains of approximately
$54 million in fiscal 2006, and gains of approximately $70 million in fiscal 2005.

Hedge Effectiveness

For interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, HP measures effectiveness by offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged debt and investments with
the change in fair value of the derivative. For interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges, HP measures effectiveness by offsetting the change in the variable portion of the interest rate
swaps with the changes in expected interest income received due to the fluctuations in the LIBOR based interest rate. For foreign currency option and forward contracts designated as cash flow or net
investment hedges, HP measures effectiveness by comparing the cumulative change in the hedge contract with the cumulative change in the hedged item, both of which are based on forward rates. HP
recognizes any ineffective portion of the hedge, as well as amounts not included in the assessment of effectiveness, in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of October 31, 2007, the
portion of hedging instruments' gains or losses excluded from the assessment of effectiveness was not material for fair value, cash flow or net investment hedges. Hedge ineffectiveness for fair value,
cash flow and net investment hedges was not material in the fiscal years ended October 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

HP
estimates the fair values of derivatives based on quoted market prices or pricing models using current market rates and records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The

Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments

For certain of HP's financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, financing receivables,
notes payable and short-term borrowings, accounts payable and other accrued liabilities, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The estimated fair value
of HP's short-and long-term debt was approximately $8.1 billion at October 31, 2007, compared to a carrying value of $8.2 billion at that date. The estimated fair
value of the debt is based primarily on quoted market prices, as well as borrowing rates currently available to HP for bank loans with similar terms and maturities.

Note 10: Financing Receivables and Operating Leases

Financing receivables represent sales-type and direct-financing leases resulting from the marketing of HP's and third-party products. These
receivables typically have terms from two to five years and are usually collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Financing receivables also include billed receivables from
operating leases. The components of net financing receivables, which are


included

Note 11: Guarantees

Indemnifications

In the ordinary course of business, HP enters into contractual arrangements under which HP may agree to indemnify the third party to such arrangement from any
losses incurred relating to the services they perform on behalf of HP or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract, which may include, for example, litigation or
claims relating to past performance. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. Historically, payments made related to these indemnifications have been immaterial.

Warranty

HP provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time it recognizes revenue. HP engages in extensive product quality programs and processes,
including actively monitoring and


evaluating
the quality of its component suppliers; however, product warranty terms offered to customers, ongoing product failure rates, material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting
a product failure, as well as specific product class failures outside of HP's baseline experience, affect the estimated warranty obligation. If actual product failure rates, material usage or service
delivery costs differ from estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

HP
may redeem some or all of the Global Notes and the Series A Medium-Term Notes (collectively, the "Notes"), as set forth in the above table, at any time at the
redemption prices described in the prospectus supplements relating thereto. The Notes are senior unsecured debt.

In
May 2006, HP filed a shelf registration statement (the "2006 Shelf Registration Statement") with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to enable HP to offer and sell,
from time to time, in one or more offerings, debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants. On May 23, 2006, HP issued $1.0 billion in floating rate
global notes due May 22, 2009 under the 2006 Shelf Registration Statement. The notes bear interest at a floating rate equal to the three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.125% per annum. HP used a portion
of the proceeds it received to repay its 5.25% Euro Medium-Term Notes due July 2006 at maturity and the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.


On February 22, 2007, HP issued an additional $2.0 billion of global notes under the 2006 Shelf Registration Statement. The global notes included
$600 million of notes due March 2012 with a floating interest rate equal to the three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.11% per annum, $900 million of notes due March 2012 with a
fixed interest rate of 5.25% per annum, and $500 million of notes due March 2017 with a fixed interest rate of 5.40% per annum. HP issued the $600 million notes at par, and HP
issued the $900 million notes and $500 million notes at discounts to par at 99.938% and 99.694%, respectively. HP used the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes,
including funding the repurchase of the notes it assumed in connection with the Mercury acquisition as described in detail below and repaying short-term commercial paper.

On
June 12, 2007, HP issued an additional $2.0 billion of global notes under the 2006 Shelf Registration Statement. The global notes included $1.0 billion of notes
due June 2009 with a floating interest rate equal to the three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.01% per annum, and $1.0 billion of notes due June 2010 with a floating interest rate equal to
the three-month USD LIBOR plus 0.06% per annum. HP issued these global notes at par. HP used the net proceeds from these offerings for general corporate purposes, including the redemption of the
floating rate global notes due May 22, 2009 in June 2007 and the repayment of short-term commercial paper.

HP
registered the sale of up to $3.0 billion of debt or global securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants under a shelf registration statement in
March 2002 (the "2002 Shelf Registration Statement"). In December 2002, HP filed a supplement to the 2002 Shelf Registration Statement, which allows HP to offer from time to time up to
$1.5 billion of Medium-Term Notes, Series B, due nine months or more from the date of issuance (the "Series B Medium-Term Note Program"). As of
October 31, 2007, HP has not issued Medium-Term Notes pursuant to the Series B Medium-Term Note Program.

HP
registered the sale of up to $3.0 billion of Medium-Term Notes under its Euro Medium-Term Note Programme filed with the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. HP
can denominate these notes in any currency, including the euro. HP has not and will not register these notes in the United States. In July 2006, HP repaid the previously issued
750 million euro notes at maturity under this programme.

The
LYONs are convertible by the holders at an adjusted rate of 15.09 shares of HP common stock for each $1,000 face value of the LYONs, payable in either cash or common stock at HP's
election. In December 2000, the HP Board of Directors authorized a repurchase program for the LYONs that allowed HP to repurchase the LYONs from time to time at varying prices. The last
repurchase under this program occurred in fiscal 2002.

In
November 2006, in connection with the Mercury acquisition, HP assumed notes issued by Mercury (the "Mercury Notes") with a face value of $300 million, maturing on
July 1, 2007 and bearing interest at a rate of 4.75% per annum. As of July 31, 2007, HP had repurchased or repaid at maturity all of the outstanding Mercury Notes.

HP
has a U.S. commercial paper program with a $6.0 billion capacity. Its subsidiaries are authorized to issue up to an additional $1.0 billion of commercial paper, of which
$500 million of capacity is currently available to be used by Hewlett-Packard International Bank PLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of HP, for its Euro Commercial Paper/Certificate of Deposit
Programme.

HP
has a $3.0 billion five-year credit facility. Commitment fees, interest rates and other terms of borrowing under the credit facility vary, based on HP's external
credit ratings. The credit facility is a


senior
unsecured committed borrowing arrangement primarily to support the issuance of U.S. commercial paper. No amounts are outstanding under the credit facility.

HP
also maintains uncommitted lines of credit from a number of financial institutions that are available through various foreign subsidiaries. The amount available for use as of
October 31, 2007 was approximately $1.8 billion.

Included
in Other, including capital lease obligations, are borrowings that are collateralized by certain financing receivable assets. As of October 31, 2007, the carrying value
of the assets approximated the carrying value of the borrowings of $5 million.

At
October 31, 2007, HP had up to approximately $10 billion of available borrowing resources under the 2002 Shelf Registration Statement and other programs. HP also may
issue additional debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants under the 2006 Shelf Registration Statement.

Aggregate
future maturities of long-term debt at face value (excluding the fair value adjustment related to SFAS 133 of $10 million and discount on debt
issuance of $145 million) were as follows at October 31, 2007:

At
October 31, 2007, HP had a deferred tax asset of $1.6 billion related to loss carryforwards, of which $1.2 billion relates to foreign net operating losses. HP has
provided a valuation allowance of $1.1 billion on those foreign net operating loss carryforwards that HP does not expect to utilize. The remaining $377 million deferred tax asset relates
to $970 million and $805 million of federal and state net operating losses, respectively, including losses from acquired companies. HP has provided $178 million in valuation
allowance for such losses, which begin to expire in fiscal 2010.

Of
the total tax credit carryforwards of $2.0 billion, HP had foreign tax credit carryforwards of $1.1 billion, of which $29 million will expire in fiscal 2012 and
the remainder of which will begin to expire in fiscal 2015. HP had alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of $86 million, which do not expire, and research and development credit
carryforwards of $387 million, which will begin to expire in fiscal 2019. HP also had tax credit carryforwards of $436 million in various states and foreign countries, on which HP has
provided a valuation allowance of $263 million. These credits begin to expire in fiscal 2009.

Gross
deferred tax assets at October 31, 2007 and 2006 were reduced by valuation allowances of $1.5 billion and $840 million, respectively. Total valuation allowances increased by
$703 million. This
valuation allowance increase was composed of a $787 million net increase attributable to foreign net operating losses not previously recorded as deferred tax assets, a $96 million increase
attributable to non-U.S. tax credits, and a $20 million increase attributable to federal net operating loss carryovers. These increases were partially offset by an $86 million decrease in the
valuation allowances on unrealized domestic capital losses, and a $114 million decrease in the valuation allowances for state tax credits and net operating losses. Of the $1.5 billion in
valuation allowances at October 31, 2007, $140 million was related to deferred tax assets for acquired companies that existed at the time of acquisition. In the future, if HP determines
that the realization of these deferred tax assets is more likely than not, the reversal of the related valuation allowance will reduce goodwill instead of the provision for taxes.

Of
the total tax benefits resulting from the exercise of employee stock options and other employee stock programs, the amounts recorded to stockholders' equity were approximately
$530 million in fiscal 2007, $356 million in fiscal 2006 and $30 million in fiscal 2005.

In
fiscal 2007, HP recorded $80 million of net income tax benefit related to items unique to the year. This is attributable to a $154 million valuation allowance release
attributable to state tax credits and $60 million benefit from foreign net operating losses, offset by $96 million net increase to various tax reserves, a net tax charge of
$18 million for the adjustment to estimated fiscal 2006 tax accruals upon filing the 2006 U.S. federal and state income tax returns, and a net tax charge of $20 million for other items.

fiscal 2006, HP recorded $599 million of net income tax benefit related to items unique to the year. This included net favorable tax adjustments of $565 million to
income tax accruals as a result of the settlement of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") examinations of HP's U.S. income tax returns for fiscal years 1993 to 1998. The reductions to the net
income tax accruals for these years related primarily to the resolution of issues with respect to Puerto Rico manufacturing tax incentives and export tax incentives, and other issues involving our
non-U.S. operations.

In
December 2006, the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 was signed into law, which includes a retroactive reinstatement of the research and development credit. The
retroactive amount was recorded in HP's financial statements in the first quarter of fiscal 2007. The amount did not have a material impact on HP's consolidated results of operations and financial
condition.

In
fiscal 2005, HP recorded $697 million of net income tax expense related to items unique to the year. The tax expense was the result primarily of $792 million associated
with the repatriation of $14.5 billion under the Jobs Act and $76 million related to additional distributions received from foreign subsidiaries. These tax expenses were offset in part
by tax benefits of $177 million resulting from agreements with
the IRS and other governmental authorities, which were reflected in "Lower rates in other jurisdictions, net" and "Other, net."

As
a result of certain employment actions and capital investments HP has undertaken, income from manufacturing activities of subsidiaries in certain countries is subject to reduced tax
rates, and in some cases is wholly exempt from taxes through 2019. The gross income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries were estimated to be $1.2 billion ($0.43
per diluted share) in fiscal year 2007, $876 million ($0.31 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2006, and $1.1 billion ($0.36 per diluted share) in fiscal year 2005. The gross income tax benefits
were offset partially by accruals of U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings.


The
IRS has completed its examination of the income tax returns of HP for all years through fiscal 1998. HP's 1993 through 1998 years were settled with the IRS's Appeals Division
and the settlements were approved by the Joint Committee on Taxation in 2006. These tax years remain open for net operating loss and foreign tax credit carrybacks from subsequent years if the IRS's
audits of those years approve such carrybacks.

On
June 28, 2007, HP received a Notice of Deficiency from the IRS for its fiscal 1999 and 2000 tax years. The Notice of Deficiency asserted that HP owes additional tax of
$13 million for these two years. At the same time, HP received a Revenue Agent's Report ("RAR") from IRS for its fiscal 2001 tax year that proposed no change in HP's tax liability for that
year. In addition to the proposed deficiencies for fiscal 1999 and 2000, the IRS's adjustments, if sustained, would reduce tax refund claims HP has filed for foreign tax credit and net operating loss
carrybacks to earlier fiscal years and reduce the tax benefits of carryforwards to subsequent years, by approximately $361 million. HP plans to contest certain of the adjustments proposed in
the Notice of Deficiency and the RAR. Towards this end, HP filed a Petition with the United States Tax Court on September 25, 2007. HP believes that it has provided adequate reserves for any
tax deficiencies or reductions in refund claims that could result from the IRS actions.

As
of October 31, 2007, the IRS was in the process of concluding its examination of HP's income tax returns for years 2002 and 2003. The IRS began an audit of HP's 2004 and 2005
income tax returns in 2007. In addition, HP is subject to numerous ongoing audits by state and foreign tax authorities. HP believes that adequate accruals have been provided for all HP open tax years.

All
Compaq tax years through the merger date with HP, May 3, 2002, have been audited and agreed with the IRS. During fiscal 2007 substantially all of the remaining tax accruals
for Compaq were reclassified as a reduction of goodwill upon closing of the statute of limitations.

HP
has not provided for U.S. federal income and foreign withholding taxes on $7.7 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. operations as of
October 31, 2007 because HP intends to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside of the United States. If HP were to distribute these earnings, foreign tax credits may become available under
current law to reduce the resulting U.S. income tax liability. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable. HP will remit
non-indefinitely reinvested earnings of its non-US subsidiaries where excess cash has accumulated and it determines that it is advantageous for business operations, tax
or cash reasons.

American Jobs Creation Act of 2004—Repatriation of Foreign Earnings

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 ("the Jobs Act"), enacted on October 22, 2004, provided for a temporary 85% dividends received deduction on certain
foreign earnings repatriated during a one-year period. The deduction resulted in an approximate 5.25% federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings. During the third quarter of fiscal 2005,
HP's CEO and Board of Directors approved a domestic reinvestment plan as required by the Jobs Act to repatriate $14.5 billion in foreign earnings in fiscal 2005.

HP
recorded tax expense in fiscal 2005 of $792 million related to this $14.5 billion dividend under the Jobs Act. The additional tax expense consists of federal taxes of
$744 million, state taxes, net of


federal
benefits, of $73 million, and a net tax benefit of $25 million related to an adjustment of deferred tax liabilities on both repatriated and unrepatriated foreign earnings.

Note 14: Stockholders' Equity

Dividends

The stockholders of HP common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by HP's Board of Directors. Dividends are paid quarterly. Dividends
were $0.32 per common share in each of fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005.

Stock Repurchase Program

HP's share repurchase program authorizes both open market and private repurchase transactions. In fiscal 2007, HP completed share repurchases of approximately
209 million shares. Repurchases of approximately 210 million shares were settled for $9.1 billion, which included approximately 1 million shares repurchased in transactions
that were executed in fiscal 2006 but settled in fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2006, HP completed share repurchases of approximately 188 million shares. Repurchases of approximately 190 million
shares were settled for $6.1 billion, which included 2 million shares repurchased in transactions that were executed in fiscal 2005 but settled in fiscal 2006. In fiscal 2005, HP
completed share repurchases of approximately 150 million shares, of which approximately 148 million shares were settled for $3.5 billion. Shares repurchased and settled in fiscal
2007 and fiscal 2006 were all open market repurchases. Shares repurchased and settled in fiscal 2005 included open market repurchases of 37 million shares for $1.0 billion and
111 million shares for $2.5 billion from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.

In
addition to the above transactions, HP entered into an Accelerated Share Repurchase (the "ASR Program") with a third-party investment bank during the second quarter of fiscal 2007.
Pursuant to the terms of the ASR Program, HP purchased 40 million shares of its common stock from the investment bank for $1.8 billion (the "Purchase Price") on March 30, 2007
(the "Purchase Date"). HP decreased its shares outstanding and reduced the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted EPS on the
Purchase Date. The shares delivered to HP included shares that the investment bank borrowed from third parties. The investment bank purchased an equivalent number of shares in the open market to cover
its position with respect to the borrowed shares during a contractually specified averaging period that began on the Purchase Date and ended on June 6, 2007. At the end of the averaging period,
the investment bank's total purchase cost based on the volume weighted-average purchase price of HP shares during the averaging period was approximately $90 million less than the Purchase
Price. Accordingly, HP had the option to either receive additional shares of HP's common stock or a cash payment in the amount of the difference from the investment bank. In June 2007, HP
received approximately 2 million additional shares purchased by the investment bank in the open market with a value approximately equal to that amount. HP reduced its shares outstanding upon
receipt of those shares.

Also,
HP entered into a prepaid variable share purchase program ("PVSPP") with a third-party investment bank during the first quarter of 2006 and prepaid approximately
$1.7 billion in exchange for the right to receive a variable number of shares of its common stock weekly over a one-year period beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2006 and
ending during the second quarter of fiscal 2007. Under the PVSPP, the prices at which HP purchased the shares were subject to a minimum and


maximum
price that was determined in advance of any repurchases being completed under the program, thereby effectively hedging HP's repurchase price. The minimum and maximum number of shares HP could
receive under the program was 52 million shares and 70 million shares, respectively. The exact number of shares to be repurchased was based upon the volume weighted-average market price
of HP's shares during each weekly settlement period, subject to the minimum and maximum price as well as regulatory limitations on the number of shares HP was permitted to repurchase. HP decreased its
shares outstanding each settlement period as shares were physically received. HP completed all repurchases under the PVSPP on March 9, 2007. As of that date, HP had cumulatively received a
total of 53 million shares. HP retired all shares repurchased and no longer deems those shares outstanding.

HP's
Board of Directors authorized an additional $8.0 billion, $10.0 billion and $4.0 billion for future share repurchases in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005,
respectively. As of October 31, 2007, HP had remaining authorization of $2.7 billion for future share repurchases. On November 19, 2007, HP's Board of Directors authorized an
additional $8.0 billion for future share repurchases.

Note 15: Retirement and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Plan Design Changes

In fiscal 2007, HP modified its U.S. defined benefit pension plan for the remaining number of U.S. employees still accruing benefits under the program. Effective
January 1, 2008, these employees will cease accruing pension benefits, and HP will calculate the final pension benefit amount based on pay and service through December 31, 2007. In
addition, HP limited future eligibility for the Pre-2003 HP Retiree Medical Program to those employees who were within five years of satisfying the program's retirement criteria on
June 30, 2007. These actions resulted in reductions to the U.S. defined benefit and post-retirement plan obligations. As a result, HP recognized one-time curtailment
gains of $541 million for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan and $1 million for the post-retirement benefit plan. As part of this announcement, HP offered an option for
eligible affected employees to participate in the 2007 EER. A total of 3,080 employees participated in the 2007 EER. HP recognized a special termination benefit expense of $307 million in
fiscal 2007, which reflects aggregate additional lump-sum benefits that HP expects to pay to those individuals participating in the 2007 EER. HP will distribute this amount from the plan
assets. Also, HP recognized a special termination benefit expense of $60 million for the HP retiree medical plans for those employees participating in the 2007 EER. This expense amount reflects
the additional medical coverage that HP expects to provide to those employees participating in the 2007 EER. The total $367 million expense for the 2007 EER was included in the restructuring
charge of fiscal 2007. HP will fund the cash expenditures associated with the 2007 EER primarily by using available U.S. pension plan assets. Eligible employees whose pension accruals will cease
effective December 31, 2007 will benefit from an increased company 401(k) match opportunity from 4 percent to 6 percent of eligible earnings effective January 1, 2008.

In
fiscal 2007, HP also recognized a net settlement loss of $8 million for its U.S. pension plans, including a settlement loss of $36 million, which was partially
offset by a settlement gain of $28 million for its U.S. pension plans. The settlement loss of $36 million related to the distributions and the subsequent transfer of accrued pension
benefits from the U.S. Excess Benefit Plan to the U.S. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan for the terminated vested plan participants. The distributions and the transfer of this pension obligation
represented a reduction in the projected benefit obligation and exceeded the sum of service and interest cost for this plan. As a result, HP recognized a portion of the unrecognized loss,
re-measured as of January 31, 2007, in the second quarter of fiscal 2007. The settlement gain of $28 million primarily resulted from the distribution of lump-sum
benefit payments


made
to pension plan participants who left HP under the 2007 EER. These lump sum benefit payments, which were paid out to participants during the October 1, 2006 to September 30,
2007 measurement period, represent a reduction in the projected benefit obligation. As a result, a portion of the unrecognized gain was recognized in fiscal 2007. The gain was recorded in accordance
with SFAS No. 88, "Employers' Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits," which requires that a settlement event be recorded once
prescribed payment thresholds have been reached. HP recorded this $28 million as a reduction to the restructuring charge recorded in connection with the 2007 EER.

In
fiscal 2007, HP recognized a net curtailment gain of $26 million for its U.S. post-retirement benefit plans. The gain included $16 million and
$9 million, resulting from the reduction in the eligible plan population stemming from the 2007 EER and the restructuring plans implemented in fiscal 2005, respectively. HP reported
these gains as reductions to the restructuring charge. HP also recorded a one-time curtailment gain of $1 million for its post-retirement benefit plans as a result of
the modification of its Pre-2003 HP Retiree Medical Program in fiscal 2007 as described above in detail.

In
fiscal 2007 HP recognized net curtailment gains of $13 million in connection with its non-U.S. defined benefit plans. These gains reflected a plan design change in Mexico and
Canada of $11 million where HP ceased pension accruals for current employees who did not meet defined criteria based on age and years of service and a $2 million gain related to the
fiscal 2005 restructuring programs recorded as a reduction to the restructuring charges in fiscal 2007. Also in fiscal 2007, HP recognized a restructuring settlement expense of $4 million. The
settlement expense reflected primarily the distribution of lump-sum benefit payments in Mexico and Canada, thereby resulting in a portion of the unrecognized loss being recorded as expense
once the settlement recognition thresholds had been reached. In addition, HP incurred a $4 million restructuring special termination benefit expense associated with the early retirement of
employees in the U.K. and Ireland.

Defined Benefit Plans

HP sponsors a number of defined benefit pension plans worldwide, of which the most significant are in the United States. The HP Retirement Plan (the "Retirement
Plan") is a defined benefit pension plan for U.S. employees hired on or before December 31, 2002. Benefits under the Retirement Plan generally are based on pay and years of service, except for
eligible pre-acquisition Compaq employees, who do not receive credit for years of service prior to January 1, 2003. Effective December 31, 2005, participants whose
combination of age plus years of service is less than 62 ceased accruing benefits under the Retirement Plan. Effective January 1, 2008, the remaining number of U.S. employees still accruing
benefits under the program will cease accruing pension benefits.

For
U.S employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2003, HP sponsors the Hewlett-Packard Company Cash Account Pension Plan (the "Cash Account Pension Plan"), under which
benefits accrue pursuant to a cash accumulation account formula based upon a percentage of pay plus interest. Effective November 30, 2005, HP merged the Cash Account Pension Plan into the
Retirement Plan; the merged plan is treated as one plan for certain legal and financial purposes, including funding requirements. The merger has no impact on the separate benefit structures of the
plans. Effective December 31, 2005, the Cash Account Pension Plan was closed to new participants, and participants whose combination of age plus years of service is less than 62 will cease
accruing benefits.


HP
reduces the benefit payable to a U.S. employee under the Retirement Plan for service before 1993, if any, by any amounts due to the employee under HP's frozen defined contribution
Deferred Profit-Sharing Plan ("the DPSP"). HP closed the DPSP to new participants in 1993. The DPSP plan obligations are equal to the plan assets and are recognized as an offset to the Retirement Plan
when HP calculates its defined benefit pension cost and obligations. The fair value of plan assets and projected benefit obligations for the U.S. defined benefit plans combined with the DPSP as of the
September 30 measurement date is as follows for the following fiscal years ended October 31:

Post-Retirement Benefit Plans

Through fiscal 2005, substantially all of HP's U.S. employees at December 31, 2002 could become eligible for partially subsidized retiree medical benefits
and retiree life insurance benefits under the Pre-2003 HP Retiree Medical Program (the "Pre-2003 Program") and certain other retiree medical programs. Plan participants in the
Pre-2003 Program make contributions based on their choice of medical option and length of service. U.S. employees hired or rehired on or after January 1, 2003 may be eligible to
participate in a post-retirement medical plan, the HP Retiree Medical Program but must bear the full cost of their participation. Effective January 1, 2006, employees whose
combination of age and years of service is less than 62 no longer will be eligible for the subsidized Pre-2003 Program, but instead will be eligible for the HP Retiree Medical Program.
Employees no longer eligible for the Pre-2003 Program, as well as employees hired on or after January 1, 2003, are eligible for certain credits under
the HP Retirement Medical Savings Account Plan ("RMSA Plan") upon attaining age 45. Upon retirement, former employees may use credits under the RMSA Plan for the reimbursement of certain eligible
medical expenses, including premiums required for participation in the HP Retiree Medical Program. Also, HP limited future eligibility for the pre-2003 HP Retiree Medical Program to those employees
who were within five years of satisfying the program's retirement criteria on June 30, 2007.

Defined Contribution Plans

HP offers various defined contribution plans for U.S. and non-U.S. employees. Total defined contribution expense was $481 million in fiscal
2007, $430 million in fiscal 2006 and $422 million in fiscal 2005. U.S. employees are automatically enrolled in the Hewlett-Packard Company 401(k) Plan (the "HP 401(k) Plan") when they
meet eligibility requirements, unless they decline participation.

During
fiscal 2007, HP matched employee contributions to the HP 401(k) Plan with cash contributions up to a maximum of 6% of eligible compensation. Effective January 1, 2008, all
U.S. employees will be eligible for a 6% HP matching contribution.


Effective
January 31, 2004, HP designated the HP Stock Fund, an investment option under the HP 401(k) Plan, as an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and, as a result, participants in
the HP Stock Fund may receive dividends in cash or may reinvest such dividends into the HP Stock Fund. HP paid approximately $9 million, $10 million and $12 million in dividends
for the HP common shares held by the HP Stock Fund in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. HP records the dividends as a reduction of retained earnings in the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders' Equity. The HP Stock Fund held approximately $28 million shares of HP common stock at October 31, 2007.

Implementation of SFAS 158

SFAS 158 requires that the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans be recognized on the company's balance sheet and changes in the funded
status be reflected in comprehensive income, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2006, which HP adopted effective October 31, 2007. SFAS 158 also requires
companies to measure the funded status of the plan as of the date of their fiscal year-end, effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008. HP expects to adopt
the measurement provisions of SFAS 158 effective October 31, 2009. The following table summarizes the financial impact stemming from the initial adoption of SFAS 158:

Investment Policy

HP's investment strategy for worldwide plan assets is to seek a competitive rate of return relative to an appropriate level of risk. The majority of the plans'
investment managers employ active investment management strategies with the goal of outperforming the broad markets in which they invest. Risk management practices include diversification across asset
classes and investment styles and periodic rebalancing toward asset allocation targets. A number of the plans' investment managers are


authorized
to utilize derivatives for investment purposes, and HP occasionally utilizes derivatives to effect asset allocation changes or to hedge certain investment exposures.

The
target asset allocation selected for each plan reflects a risk/return profile HP feels is appropriate relative to each plan's liability structure and return goals. HP regularly
conducts periodic asset-liability studies for U.S. plan assets in order to model various potential asset allocations in comparison to each plan's forecasted liabilities and liquidity needs. HP invests
a portion of the U.S. defined benefit plan assets and post-retirement benefit plan assets in private market securities such as venture capital funds, private debt and private equity to
provide diversification and higher expected returns.

Outside
the United States, local regulations require different approaches to target asset allocations, resulting in a higher percentage allocation in fixed income securities. For each
country outside the U.S., the local pension board decides on the target allocation after consideration of local regulations. HP's corporate office acts in a governance role in periodically reviewing
investment strategy and providing a recommended list of investment managers for each country plan.

Basis for Expected Long-Term Rate of Return on Plan Assets

The expected long-term rate of return on assets for each U.S. plan reflects the expected returns for each major asset class in which the plan invests,
the weight of each asset class in the target mix, the correlations among asset classes and their expected volatilities. Expected asset class returns reflect the current yield on U.S. government bonds
and risk premiums for each asset class. Because HP's investment policy is to employ primarily active investment managers who seek to outperform the broader market, the asset class expected returns are
adjusted to reflect the expected additional returns net of fees.

In
the beginning of fiscal 2008, HP implemented a liability-driven investment strategy for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which will be frozen by December 31, 2007 and is
currently overfunded. As part of the strategy, HP has transitioned its equity allocation to predominantly fixed income assets. The expected return on the plan assets, used in calculating the net
benefit cost, has been reduced from 8.3% to 6.3% for fiscal 2008 to reflect the changes in its asset allocation policy.

The
approach used to arrive at the expected rate of return on assets for the non-U.S. plans reflects the asset allocation policy of each plan to the expected country real
returns for equity and fixed income investments. On an annual basis, HP gathers empirical data from the local country subsidiaries to determine expected long-term rates of return for
equity and fixed income securities. HP then weights these expected real rates of return based on country specific allocation mixes adjusted for inflation.

Future Contributions and Funding Policy

In fiscal 2008, HP expects to contribute approximately $145 million to its pension plans and approximately $15 million to cover benefit payments to
U.S. non-qualified plan participants. HP expects to pay approximately $80 million to cover benefit claims for HP's post-retirement benefit plans. HP's funding policy is
to contribute cash to its pension plans so that it meets at least the minimum contribution requirements, as established by local government and funding and taxing authorities.

In
August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the "Act") was enacted into law. The Act did not have any significant effect on HP's current funding strategy for its U.S. pension
plan.


Estimated Future Benefits Payable

HP estimates that the future benefits payable for the retirement and post-retirement plans in place were as follows at October 31, 2007:

Note 16: Commitments

HP leases certain real and personal property under non-cancelable operating leases. Certain leases require HP to pay property taxes, insurance and
routine maintenance and include escalation clauses. Rent expense was approximately $767 million in fiscal 2007, $744 million in fiscal 2006 and $770 million in fiscal 2005. Sublease
rental income was approximately $44 million in fiscal 2007, $47 million in fiscal 2006 and $43 million in fiscal 2005.

or services that are enforceable and legally binding on HP and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased, fixed, minimum or variable price provisions
and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty. These unconditional purchase obligations are related principally to
inventory and other items. Future unconditional purchase obligations at October 31, 2007 were as follows:

Note 17: Litigation and Contingencies

HP is involved in lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings, including those identified below, consisting of intellectual property, commercial, securities,
employment, employee benefits and environmental matters, which arise in the ordinary course of business. In accordance with SFAS No. 5, "Accounting for Contingencies", HP records a provision
for a liability when management believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. HP believes it has adequate provisions for
any such matters. HP reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and other
information and events pertaining to a particular case. Based on its experience, HP believes that any damage amounts claimed in the specific matters discussed below are not a meaningful indicator of
HP's potential liability. Litigation is inherently unpredictable. However, HP believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Nevertheless, it is possible that
cash flows or results of operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies, or because of the diversion of
management's attention and the creation of significant expenses.

Litigation, Proceedings and Investigations

Copyright levies.

As described below, proceedings are ongoing against HP in certain European
Union ("EU") member countries, including litigation in Germany, seeking to impose levies upon equipment (such as multifunction devices ("MFDs") and printers) and alleging that these devices enable
producing private copies of copyrighted materials. The total levies due, if imposed, would be based upon the number of products sold and the per-product amounts of the levies, which vary.
Some EU member countries that do not yet have levies on digital devices are expected to implement similar legislation to enable them to extend existing levy schemes, while some other EU member
countries are expected to limit the scope of levy schemes and applicability in the digital hardware environment. HP, other companies and various industry associations are opposing the extension of
levies to the digital environment and advocating compensation to rights holders through digital rights management systems.

VerwertungsGesellschaft
Wort ("VG Wort"), a collection agency representing certain copyright holders, instituted non-binding arbitration proceedings against HP in
June 2001 in Germany before the arbitration board of the Patent and Trademark Office. The proceedings relate to whether and to what extent copyright levies for photocopiers should be imposed in
accordance with copyright laws implemented in Germany on MFDs that allegedly enable the production of copies by private persons. Following unsuccessful arbitration, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against HP
in May 2004 in the Stuttgart Civil Court in Stuttgart, Germany seeking levies on MFDs sold from 1997 to 2001. On December 22, 2004, the court held that HP is liable for payments
regarding MFDs sold in Germany, and ordered HP to pay VG Wort an amount equal to 5% of the outstanding levies claimed plus interest on MFDs sold in Germany up to December 2001. VG Wort appealed
this decision. On July 6, 2005, the Stuttgart Court of Appeals ordered HP to pay VG Wort levies based on the published tariffs for photocopiers in Germany (which range from EUR 38.35 to EUR
613.56 per unit) plus interest on MFDs sold in Germany up to December 2001. HP has appealed the Stuttgart Court of Appeals' decision to the Bundesgerichtshof (the German Federal Supreme Court).
An oral hearing has been set for January 30, 2008.

On
September 26, 2005, VG Wort filed an additional lawsuit against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court in Stuttgart, Germany seeking levies on MFDs sold in Germany between 1997 and
2001, as well


as
for products sold from 2002 onwards. On July 26, 2007, the court issued a decision following the ruling of the Stuttgart Court of Appeals with respect to the initial VG Wort lawsuit as
described above. HP has appealed the decision. The Appeal Court has stayed the proceedings pending the German Federal Supreme Court judgment in the initial VG Wort lawsuit seeking levies on MFDs
described above.

In
July 2004, VG Wort filed a separate lawsuit against HP in the Stuttgart Civil Court seeking levies on printers. On December 22, 2004, the court held that HP is liable
for payments regarding all printers using ASCII code sold in Germany but did not determine the amount payable per unit. HP appealed this decision in January 2005 to the Higher Regional Court of
Baden Wuerttemberg. On May 11, 2005, the Higher Regional Court issued a decision confirming that levies are due. On June 6, 2005, HP filed an appeal to the German Federal Supreme Court
in Karlsruhe. On December 6, 2007 the German Federal Supreme Court issued a judgment that printers are not subject to levies under the existing law. The court has not yet issued a written
decision, and VG Wort has indicated that it is considering a claim to the German Federal Constitutional Court.

In
September 2003, VG Wort filed a lawsuit against Fujitsu Siemens Computer GmbH ("FSC") in Munich State Court seeking levies on PCs. This is an industry test case in Germany, and
HP has agreed not to object to the delay if VG Wort sues HP for such levies on PCs following a final decision against FSC. On December 23, 2004, the Munich State Court held that PCs are subject
to a levy and that FSC must pay 12 euros plus compound interest for each PC sold in Germany since March 2001. FSC appealed this decision in January 2005 to the Higher Regional Court of
Bavaria. On December 15, 2005, the Higher Regional Court affirmed the Munich State Court decision. FSC filed an appeal with the German Federal Supreme Court in February 2006.

On
December 29, 2005, ZPU, a joint association of various German collection societies, instituted non-binding arbitration proceedings against HP before the arbitration
board of the Patent and Trademark Office demanding reporting of every PC sold by HP in Germany from January 2002 through December 2005 and seeking a levy of 18.42 euros plus tax for each
PC sold during that period. HP filed a notice of defense in connection with these proceedings in February 2006, and an arbitration hearing was held in December 2006. On August 3,
2007, the arbitration board issued a ruling proposing a levy of 15 euros plus tax for each PC sold during that period. HP has rejected the ruling of the arbitration board, and the arbitration
proceedings have concluded. ZPU has indicated it will pursue the claim through the regular courts.

Based
on industry opposition to the extension of levies to digital products, HP's assessments of the merits of various proceedings and HP's estimates of the units impacted and levies, HP
has accrued amounts that it believes are adequate to address the matters described above. However, the ultimate resolution of these matters and the associated financial impact on HP, including the
number of units impacted, the amount of levies imposed and the ability of HP to recover such amounts through increased prices, remains uncertain.

Alvis v. HP

is a defective product consumer class action filed in the District Court of Jefferson County,
Texas in April 2001. In February 2000, a similar suit captioned

LaPray v. Compaq

was filed in the District
Court of Jefferson County, Texas. The basic allegation is that HP and Compaq sold computers containing floppy disk controllers that fail to alert the user to certain floppy disk controller errors.
That failure is alleged to result in data loss or data corruption. The complaints in

Alvis

and

LaPray

seek injunctive relief, declaratory
relief, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. In July 2001, a


nationwide
class was certified in the

LaPray

case, which the Beaumont Court of Appeals affirmed in June 2002. The
Texas Supreme Court reversed the certification and remanded to the trial court in May 2004. On March 29, 2005, the

Alvis

trial court certified a Texas-wide class action for injunctive
relief only, which HP appealed on
April 15, 2005. HP's appeal in the

Alvis

case is still pending. On June 4, 2003, each of

Barrett v. HP

and

Grider v. Compaq

was filed
in the District Court of Cleveland County, Oklahoma, with factual allegations similar to those in

Alvis

and

LaPray

. The complaints in

Barrett

and

Grider

seek, among other things, specific performance, declaratory relief, unspecified damages and attorneys' fees. On
December 22, 2003, the District Court entered an order staying the

Barrett

case until the conclusion of

Alvis

. On September 23,
2005, the District Court granted the

Grider

plaintiffs' motion to certify a nationwide class action which the Oklahoma Court of Civil Appeals affirmed on
October 13, 2006. On November 5, 2006, HP filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari with the Oklahoma Supreme Court seeking reversal of the lower courts' decisions. That petition was
denied on March 26, 2007. The

Grider

case is scheduled for trial in April of 2008. On November 5, 2004,

Batiste v. HP

(formerly

Scott v. HP

), and on
January 27, 2005,

Schultz v. HP

(formerly

Jurado v.
HP

), were filed in state court in San Joaquin County, California, with factual allegations similar to those in

LaPray

and

Alvis

, seeking certification of a
California-only class, injunctive relief, unspecified damages (including punitive damages), restitution, costs, and attorneys' fees. On November 27, 2006, the trial court granted
plaintiff's motion for class certification and certified the

Schultz

case as a California-only class. On
March 26, 2007, HP filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate with the California Supreme Court; that petition was summarily denied on May 9, 2007. On December 11, 2007, the court in
the

Grider v. Compaq

and

Barrett v. HP

cases
preliminarily approved a settlement under which the

Grider

,

Barrett

,

Alvis

,

LaPray

,

Schultz

and

Batiste

class actions will be dismissed with prejudice. Under the proposed settlement, eligible class members will each
have the right to obtain a redemption certificate for use in purchasing a PC through HP's website; a USB flash drive as long as the class member meets certain requirements; and a software patch
designed to address the alleged defect at issue in the lawsuits. In addition, class counsel and the class representatives will be paid attorneys' fees and expenses and stipends in an amount that is
yet to be finally approved by the court. As of October 31, 2007, HP had established adequate reserves to cover the costs associated with the settlement, including the anticipated attorneys'
fees and expenses and stipends. The court has scheduled a hearing for April 29, 2008 to determine whether to grant final approval of the settlement. In addition, the Civil Division of the
Department of Justice, the General Services Administration Office of Inspector General and other Federal agencies are conducting an investigation of allegations that HP and Compaq made, or caused to
be made, false claims for payment to the United States for computers known by HP and Compaq to contain defective parts or otherwise to perform in a defective manner relating to the same alleged floppy
disk controller errors. HP's agreement with the Department of Justice to extend the statute of limitations on its investigation expired on December 6, 2006. HP is cooperating fully with this
investigation.

Barbara's Sales, et al. v. Intel Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, et al.

and

Neubauer, et al. v. Compaq Computer Corporation

are
separate lawsuits filed on June 3, 2002 in the Circuit
Court, Third Judicial District, Madison County, Illinois, alleging that HP and Compaq (along with Intel) misled the public by suppressing and concealing the alleged material fact that systems that use
the Intel Pentium 4 processor are less powerful and slower than systems using the Intel Pentium III processor and processors made by a competitor of Intel. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages,
restitution, attorneys' fees and costs, and certification of a nationwide class. The trial court in the HP action certified an Illinois class as to Intel but denied a nationwide class. Both parties
appealed the trial


court's
decision. On July 25, 2006, the Fifth District Appellate Court ruled that the trial court erred in applying Illinois law in deciding to certify the Illinois class and to deny
certification of the nationwide class and directed the trial court to reconsider those decisions applying California law instead. On August 28, 2006, Intel appealed the Fifth District's
decision to the Illinois Supreme Court. On November 29, 2007, the Illinois Supreme Court reversed certification of the nationwide class, held that no statewide class could be certified under
Illinois law, and remanded the case back to the trial court.

Skold, et al. v. Intel Corporation and Hewlett-Packard
Company

is a lawsuit to which HP was joined on June 14, 2004 that was initially filed in state court in Alameda County, California, based upon factual
allegations similar to those in the Illinois cases. The plaintiffs in the

Skold

matter also seek unspecified damages,
restitution, attorneys' fees and costs, and certification of a nationwide class. The

Skold

case has since been transferred
to state court in Santa Clara County, California.

Feder v. HP

(formerly

Tyler v.
HP

) is a lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on June 16, 2005 asserting breach of express and
implied warranty, unjust enrichment, violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act and deceptive advertising and unfair business practices in violation of California's Unfair Competition Law. Among
other things, plaintiffs alleged that HP employed a "smart chip" in certain inkjet printing products in order to register ink depletion prematurely and to render the cartridge unusable through a
built-in expiration date that is hidden, not documented in marketing materials to consumers, or both. Plaintiffs also contend that consumers received false ink depletion warnings and that
the smart chip limits the ability of consumers to use the cartridge to its full capacity or to choose competitive products. On September 6, 2005, a lawsuit captioned

Ciolino v. HP

was filed
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The allegations in the

Ciolino

case are substantively identical to those in

Feder

, and the two cases have been formally consolidated in a single proceeding in the District Court for the Northern
District of California under the caption

In re HP Inkjet Printer Litigation

. In addition, on January 17, 2007, an
additional lawsuit captioned

Blennis v. HP

was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
California with allegations substantially the same as those consolidated in

In re Inkjet Printer Litigation

. The plaintiffs
seek class certification, restitution, damages (including enhanced damages), injunctive relief, interest, costs, and attorneys' fees. Three related lawsuits filed in California state court,

Tyler v. HP

(filed in Santa Clara County on February 17, 2005),

Obi v.
HP

(filed in Los Angeles County on February 17, 2005), and

Weingart v. HP

(filed in Los Angeles County on March 18, 2005), have been dismissed without prejudice by the plaintiffs. In addition, two related lawsuits filed in federal court, namely

Grabell v. HP

(filed in the District of New Jersey on March 18, 2005) and

Just
v. HP

(filed in the Eastern District of New York on April 20, 2005), have been dismissed without prejudice by the plaintiffs. Substantially similar
allegations have been made against HP and its subsidiary, Hewlett-Packard (Canada) Co., in four Canadian class actions, one commenced in British Columbia in February 2006, two commenced in
Quebec in April 2006 and May 2006, respectively, and one commenced in Ontario in June 2006, all seeking class certification,
restitution, declaratory relief, injunctive relief and unspecified statutory, compensatory and punitive damages.

Schorsch v. HP

is a consumer class action filed against HP on October 28, 2003 in Illinois state court
alleging that HP has included an electrically erasable programmable read only memory (EEPROM) chip in certain of its LaserJet printers that prematurely advises the user that the drum kit needs
replacing in violation of Illinois state law. The plaintiffs subsequently filed an amended complaint seeking to expand the class from purchasers of drum kits to purchasers of all HP printer
consumables


that
contain EEPROM chips. The most current amended complaint seeks certification of an Illinois-only class and seeks unspecified damages, attorneys' fees and costs. On June 6,
2007, a separate consumer class action lawsuit captioned

Baggett v. HP

was filed in the United States District Court for
the Central District of California containing similar allegations that HP employs a technology in its LaserJet color printers whereby the printing process shuts down prematurely, preventing customers
from using the toner that is stranded in the cartridge. The plaintiffs allege that HP fails to disclose to consumers that they will be unable to utilize the toner remaining in the cartridge after the
printer shuts down. The complaint seeks certification of a nationwide class of purchasers of all HP LaserJet color printers and seeks unspecified damages, restitution, disgorgement, injunctive relief,
attorneys' fees and costs.

Rich v. HP

is a consumer class action filed against HP on May 22, 2006 in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California. The suit alleges that HP designed its color inkjet printers to unnecessarily use color ink in addition to black ink when printing black and white images
and text. The plaintiffs seek injunctive and monetary relief on behalf of a nationwide class. The Court has granted HP's motion to dismiss several of the plaintiffs' claims, and HP answered the
remaining claims in February 2007.

On
December 27, 2001,

Cornell University and the Cornell Research Foundation, Inc.

filed a
complaint, amended on September 6, 2002, against HP in United States District Court for the Northern District of New York alleging that HP's PA-RISC 8000 family of microprocessors,
and servers and workstations incorporating those processors, infringe a patent assigned to Cornell Research Foundation, Inc. that describes a way of executing microprocessor instructions. The
complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief and unspecified damages. On March 26, 2004, the district court issued a ruling interpreting the disputed claim terms in the patent at issue. HP
filed five motions for summary judgment on September 29, 2006. The district court ruled on those motions September 24, 2007, eliminating certain patent claims but otherwise allowing the
case to proceed to trial. The patent at issue in this litigation, United States Patent No. 4,807,115, expired on February 21, 2006. Therefore, the plaintiffs are no longer entitled to
seek injunctive relief against HP. No trial date has been set.

Digwamaje et al. v. Bank of America et al.

is a purported class action lawsuit
that names HP and numerous other multinational corporations as defendants. It was filed on September 27, 2002 in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on behalf of
current and former South African citizens and their survivors who suffered violence and oppression under the apartheid regime. The lawsuit alleges that HP and other companies helped perpetuate,
profited from, and otherwise aided and abetted the apartheid regime during the period from 1948-1994 by selling products and services to agencies of the South African government. Claims
are based on the Alien Tort Claims Act, the Torture Victims Protection Act, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act and state law. The complaint seeks, among other things, an
accounting, the creation of a historic commission, compensatory damages in excess of $200 billion, punitive damages in excess of $200 billion, costs and attorneys' fees. On
November 29, 2004, the District Court dismissed with prejudice the plaintiffs' complaint. On October 12, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in part
and reversed in part the District Court's decision. The Second Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims under the Torture Victims Protection Act, but reversed the District Court's
dismissal of the plaintiffs' Alien Tort Claims Act claims, finding that it was possible for the plaintiffs to state such


a
claim. The Second Circuit, therefore, remanded the case to the District Court to permit the plaintiffs to attempt to plead the allegations needed to state a claim under the Alien Tort Claims Act.

CSIRO Patent Litigation. Microsoft Corporation, Hewlett-Packard Company, et al. v. Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation of Australia

is an action filed by HP and two other plaintiffs on May 9, 2005 in the District Court for the Northern District of California
seeking a declaratory judgment against Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation of Australia ("CSIRO") that HP's products employing the IEEE 802.11a and 8.02.11g wireless protocol
standards do not infringe CSIRO's US patent no. 5,487,069 relating to wireless transmission of data at frequencies in excess of 10GHz. On September 22, 2005, CSIRO filed an answer and
counterclaims alleging that all HP products which employ those wireless protocol standards infringe the CSIRO patent and seeking damages, including enhanced damages and attorneys fees and costs, and
an injunction against sales of infringing products. On December 12, 2006, CSIRO successfully moved to have the case transferred to the District Court of the Eastern District of Texas, a court
that has granted CSIRO's motions for summary judgment on the issues of validity and patent infringement and a permanent injunction in favor of CSIRO in a patent infringement action brought by CSIRO
against a third party vendor of wireless networking products based on the same patent. On June 15, 2007, CSIRO filed an amended answer and counterclaims adding the allegation that all HP
products which employ the draft IEEE 802.11n wireless protocol infringe the CSIRO patent. Trial is scheduled for April 2009.

Polaroid Corp. v. HP

is a lawsuit filed against HP by Polaroid Corporation on December 2006 in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware. The lawsuit involves a single U.S. patent that will expire in April 2008. Polaroid alleges that certain HP products containing
"Digital Flash" or "Adaptive Lighting" technology infringe Polaroid's U.S. Patent No. 4,829,381 relating to a system and method for continuously enhancing electronic images by varying the
contrast in different portions of the image. Polaroid seeks monetary relief. A trial is scheduled for December 2008.

Tandberg Data Corporation v. HP:

In January 2006, Exabyte Corporation, which has since
been acquired by Tandberg Data Corporation, sued HP in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiff alleges that a particular HP tape drive infringes a patent that
describes an apparatus and method for recovering data from a distorted tape by rewinding and replaying the tape at a slower speed. The complaint seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages. In
June 2006, HP asserted counterclaims against the plaintiff and is now asserting two HP patents relating to tape drive technology. HP seeks injunctive relief and unspecified damages for the
plaintiff's alleged infringement. A claim construction hearing is scheduled for January 2008, and a trial is scheduled for September 2008.

Convolve, Inc. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology v. Compaq Computer Corporation and Seagate Technology,
Inc.

In July 2000, Compaq and Seagate were sued in the United States District court for the Southern District of New York by MIT and a small
technology company named Convolve. Convolve accused Compaq and Seagate of misappropriating certain confidential information and infringing certain patents in Seagate's development of certain disk
drive products and Compaq's development of a user interface. MIT and Convolve are owners of one of the patents at issue. With respect to one of the patents, the accused feature is contained within the
Seagate drive procured by Compaq, not in Compaq's own designs or products; therefore, Seagate is taking the lead in defending against Convolve's claims. The second patent relates to a user interface
that HP has removed from its


products.
Seagate has agreed to indemnify HP with respect to one patent; HP has requested but not received indemnification from Seagate with respect to the second. Pre-trial discovery is ongoing. A
claim construction hearing was held on March 30-31, 2004; the court issued its ruling on August 10, 2005. No trial date has been set.

The United States of America, ex rel. Norman Rille and Neal Roberts v. Hewlett-Packard Company,
et al.

In 2004, two private individuals filed a civil "

qui tam

" complaint under the False
Claims Act in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas containing generalized allegations that HP and several other companies participated in an industry-wide
practice of using partnership and alliance programs to make improper payments and cause the submission of false claims in connection with contracts to provide products and services to the federal
government. On April 12, 2007, the U.S. Department of Justice intervened in the

qui tam

action and filed a complaint against HP (and several
other companies in separate actions) on behalf of the United States containing allegations that HP violated the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Act of 1986 by providing millions of
dollars in kickbacks to its alliance partners, including "influencer fees" and "new business opportunity rebates." The U.S. complaint further alleges that HP violated the False Claims Act and the
Anti-Kickback Act, breached its federal government contracts, induced the federal government to make payments to HP to which HP was not entitled to receive under those contracts, and was
unjustly enriched by expressly or impliedly making false statements, records or certifications to the federal government that it complied with and would continue to comply with the
Anti-Kickback Act and by submitting claims to the government that allegedly were inflated because they included the amounts of the influencer fees and new business opportunity rebates. The
U.S. complaint seeks treble damages plus civil penalties in connection with the alleged violations of the False Claims Act, double damages plus civil penalties in connection with the alleged
violations of the Anti-Kickback Act and disgorgement of profits earned in connection with the breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims.

Leak Investigation Proceedings.

As described below, HP is or has been the subject of various
governmental inquiries concerning the processes employed in an investigation into leaks of HP confidential information to members of the media that concluded in May 2006:

•

In
August 2006, HP was informally contacted by the Attorney General of the State of California requesting information concerning the processes employed in the leak
investigation. On December 7, 2006, HP announced that it has entered into an agreement with the California Attorney General to resolve civil claims arising from the leak investigation,
including a claim made by the California Attorney General in a Santa Clara County Superior Court action filed on December 7, 2006 that HP committed unfair business practices under California
law in connection with the leak investigation. As a result of this agreement, which includes an injunction, the California Attorney General will not pursue civil claims against HP or its current and
former directors, officers and employees. Under the terms of the agreement, HP paid a total of $14.5 million and agreed to implement and maintain for five years a series of measures designed to
ensure that HP's corporate investigations are conducted in accordance with California law and the company's high ethical standards. Of the $14.5 million, $13.5 million has been used to
create a Privacy and Piracy Fund to assist California prosecutors in investigating and prosecuting consumer privacy and information piracy violations, $650,000 was used to pay statutory damages and
$350,000 reimbursed the California Attorney General's office for its investigation costs. There was no finding of liability against HP as part of the settlement.


•

Beginning
in September 2006, HP has received requests from the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the U.S. House of Representatives (the "Committee") for records and
information concerning the leak investigation, securities transactions by HP officers and directors, including an August 25, 2006 securities transaction by Mark Hurd, HP's Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer, and related matters. HP has responded to those requests. In addition, Mr. Hurd voluntarily gave testimony before the Committee regarding the leak investigation on
September 28, 2006.

•

In
September 2006, HP was informally contacted by the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of California requesting similar information concerning the processes
employed in the leak investigation. HP is responding to that request.

•

Beginning
in September 2006, HP has received requests from the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission for records and information and
interviews with current and former HP directors and officers relating to the leak investigation, the resignation of Thomas J. Perkins from HP's Board of Directors, HP's May 22, 2006 and
September 6, 2006 filings with the SEC on Form 8-K, stock repurchases by HP and securities transactions by its officers and directors that occurred between May 1 and
October 1, 2006, and HP's policies, practices and approval of securities transactions. In May 2007, HP consented to the entry of an order by the SEC ordering HP to cease and desist from
committing or causing violations of the public reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. HP has been advised by the staff of the Division of Enforcement that the staff
has completed its investigation and does not intend to recommend that any other SEC enforcement action be brought in connection with these matters.

•

In
September 2006, HP received a request from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for records and information relating to the processes employed in the leak
investigation. HP has responded to that request.

HP
is continuing to cooperate fully with all ongoing inquiries and investigations.

In
addition, four stockholder derivative lawsuits have been filed in California purportedly on behalf of HP stockholders seeking to recover damages for alleged breach of fiduciary duty
and to require HP to improve its corporate governance and internal control procedures as a result of the activities of the leak investigation:

Staehr v. Dunn,
et al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 18, 2006;

Worsham v. Dunn,
et al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 14, 2006;

Tansey v. Dunn,
et al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 20, 2006; and

Hall v. Dunn,
et al.

was filed in Santa Clara County Superior Court on September 25, 2006. On October 19, 2006, the Santa Clara County Superior Court
consolidated the four California cases under the caption

In re Hewlett-Packard Company Derivative Litigation

. The
consolidated complaint filed on November 19, 2006 also seeks to recover damages in connection with sales of HP stock alleged to have been made by certain current and former HP officers and
directors while in possession of material non-public information. Two additional stockholder derivative lawsuits,

Pifko v. Babbio,
et al.

, filed on September 19, 2006, and

Gross v. Babbio,
et al.

, filed on November 21, 2006, were filed in Chancery Court, County of New Castle, Delaware, both of which seek to recover damages for alleged
breaches of fiduciary duty and to obtain an order instructing the defendants to refrain from further breaches of fiduciary duty and to implement corrective measures that will prevent future
occurrences of the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty. On January 24, 2007, the Delaware court


consolidated
the two cases under the caption

In re Hewlett-Packard Company Derivative Litigation

and subsequently stayed
the proceedings, as the parties have reached a tentative settlement. The HP Board of Directors has appointed a Special Litigation Committee consisting of independent Board members authorized to
investigate, review and evaluate the facts and circumstances asserted in these derivative matters and to determine how HP should proceed in these matters. On December 14, 2007, HP and the
plaintiffs in the California and Delaware derivative actions entered into an agreement to settle those lawsuits, which agreement is subject to the approval of the California and Delaware courts before
it becomes final. Under the terms of the proposed settlement, HP has agreed to continue certain corporate governance changes until December 31, 2012 and to pay the plaintiffs' attorneys' fees.

Mercury Interactive Corporation Proceedings.

In November 2006, HP completed its
acquisition of Mercury Interactive Corporation ("Mercury"). Upon completion of the acquisition, HP assumed oversight for all litigation and regulatory matters pending or subsequently commenced against
Mercury. The following Mercury-related litigation and regulatory inquiries currently are pending:

•

Prior
to the announcement of the acquisition, and beginning on or about August 19, 2005, four securities class action lawsuits were filed against Mercury and certain
of its officers and directors on behalf of purchasers of Mercury's stock from October 2003 to November 2005:

Archdiocese of Milwaukee Supporting
Fund, Inc. v. Mercury Interactive, et al, Johnson v. Mercury Interactive, et al., Munao v. Mercury Interactive, et al.

, and

Public Employees' Retirement System of Mississippi
v. Mercury Interactive, et al

. These class action lawsuits were
consolidated in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California as

In re Mercury Interactive Corporation Securities
Litigation

. The consolidated complaint filed on September 8, 2006 alleges that, during the putative class period of October 17, 2000 through
November 1, 2005, the defendants made false or misleading public statements regarding Mercury's business and operations in violation of Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder and seeks

unspecified
monetary damages and other relief. On July 30, 2007, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint with leave to amend. On October 15, 2007,
HP and counsel for the plaintiffs reached an agreement in principle to settle the consolidated class action lawsuit. The agreement, if finalized and approved by the court, provides for HP to pay an
aggregate of $117.5 million to administer the settlement, to compensate the class, and to pay attorneys' fees.

•

On
February 26, 2007, HP received a request from the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the U.S. Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs for information relating to Mercury's past executive compensation and stock option granting policies and procedures, including information about the practice of backdating the grant date of
options that allegedly occurred before HP acquired Mercury. HP has responded to the Subcommittee's request and intends to cooperate with the inquiry.

European Commission OEM Investigation.

In May 2002, the European Commission of the EU
publicly stated that it was considering conducting an investigation into original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") activities concerning the sales of printers and supplies to consumers within the EU.
The European Commission contacted HP requesting information on the printing systems businesses. HP has cooperated fully in response to the initial inquiry and intends to cooperate fully with respect
to subsequent requests for information.


Environmental

HP is party to, or otherwise involved in, proceedings brought by U.S. or state environmental agencies under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), known as "Superfund," or state laws similar to CERCLA. HP is also conducting environmental investigations or remediations at several current or former operating sites
pursuant to administrative orders or consent agreements with state environmental agencies. It is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental clean-up to sites outside the United
States, even where we are not required to do so under applicable local laws and regulations.

The
European Union ("EU") adopted the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive in January 2003. The directive makes producers of electrical goods, including computers
and printers, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. The deadline for the individual member states of the EU to enact
legislation implementing the directive in their respective countries was August 13, 2004 (such legislation, together with the directive, the "WEEE Legislation"). The EU member states were
obliged to make producers participating in the market financially responsible for implementing these responsibilities under the WEEE Legislation beginning in August 2005. Implementation in
certain of the member states has been delayed into 2007. Similar legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including in the United States, Canada, Mexico, China and Japan. HP is
continuing to evaluate the impact of and take steps to comply with the WEEE Legislation and similar legislation in other jurisdictions as individual countries issue their implementation legislation
and guidance.

The
liability for environmental remediation and other environmental costs is accrued when it is considered probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued amounts in
conjunction with the foregoing environmental issues that we believe was adequate as of October 31, 2007. These accruals were not material to our operations or financial position and we do not
currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities.

results are substantially the same as those the consolidated company uses. Management measures the performance of each business segment based on several metrics, including earnings from operations.
Management uses these results, in part, to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the business segments. HP does not allocate to its business segments certain operating
expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include primarily amortization of purchased intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense related to
HP-granted employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan, certain acquisition-related charges and charges for purchased IPR&D, as well as certain corporate governance costs.

HP
does not allocate to its business segments restructuring charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions.
