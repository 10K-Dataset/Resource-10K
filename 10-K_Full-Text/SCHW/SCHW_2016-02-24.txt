PART

Business

General Corporate Overview

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC)

, the Company had full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis that represented the equivalent of about

15,300

full-time employees.

®

, Inc., a growth and dividend income-focused asset management firm.

In September 2011, the Company acquired optionsXpress Holdings, Inc. (optionsXpress), an online brokerage firm primarily focused on equity options and futures. The optionsXpress

®

Business Strategy and Competitive Environment

Recognizing the benefits of having a clear strategy

,

management has developed a framework that consists of a purpose, vision, and values guided by the Company’s “Through Cli

ents’ Eyes” strategy.

The Company’s stated purpose is to champion every client’s goals with passion and integrity, believing the best long-term strategy is one that puts clients’ perspectives, needs

, and desires at the forefront.

The Company’s vision is to be

the most trusted leader in investment servi

ces.

Because investing plays a fundamental role in building financial security, the Company strives to deliver a better investing experience for its clients – individual investors and the people and institutions who serve them – by disrupting longstanding industry practices on their behalf and providing superior service. The Company aims to offer a broad range of products and solutions to choose from, including relevant and actionable advice, with a focus on transparency and convenience. In addition, management works to leverage the Company’s scale and resources, as well as expense discipline, to help keep costs

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

low and ensure that client solutions are both affordable and responsive to needs. Finally, the Company works to be a good steward of stockholder capital and aims to maximize the Company’s value and returns over time.

The Company

’

s competition in serving individual investors includes a wide range of brokerage, wealth management, and asset management firms, as well as banks and trust companies. In serving investors and competing for a growing percentage of the investable wealth in the

United States (

U.S.

)

, the Company offers a multi-channel service delivery model, which includes online, mobile, telephon

e

, and branch capabilities. Under this model, the Company can offer personalized service at competitive prices while giving clients the choice of where, when, and how they do business with the Company. Schwab’s branches and regional telephone service centers are staffed with trained and

experienced financial consultants (FC

s

)

focused on building and sustaining client relationships. The Company offers the ability to meet client investing needs through a single ongoing point of contact, even as those needs change over time.

M

anagement believes that the Company’s ability to provide those clients seeking help, guidance, or advice with an individually tailored solution – ranging from occasional consultations to an ongoing relationship with a Schwab FC or an

independent investment advisor (IA)

– is a competitive strength compared to the more fragmented

or limited

offerings of other firms.

The Company’s online, mobile, telephon

e

and branch

channels provide quick and efficient access to an extensive array of information, research, tools, trade execution, and administrative services, which clients can access according to their needs. For example, clients that trade more actively can use these channels to access highly competitive pricing, expert tools, and extensive service capabilities – including experienced, knowledgeable teams of trading specialists and integrated product offerings. Individuals investing for retirement through 401(k) plans can take advantage of the Company’s bundled offering of multiple investment choices, education, and third-party advice. Management also believes the Company is able to compete with the wide variety of financial services firms striving to attract individual client relationships by complementing these capabilities with the extensive array of investment, banking, and lending products and services described in the section

below

.

In the IA arena, the Company competes with institutional custodians, traditional and discount brokers, banks, investment advisory firms, and trust companies. Management believes that its Advisor Services segment can maintain its market leadership position primarily thr

ough the efforts of its

sales and support teams, which are dedicated to helping IAs grow, compete, and succeed in serving their clients. In addition to focusing on superior service, Advisor Services competes by utilizing technology to provide IAs with a highly-developed, scalable platform for administering their clients’ assets easily and efficiently. Advisor Services sponsors a variety of national, regional, and local events designed to help IAs identify and implement better ways to grow and manage their practices efficiently.

An important aspect of the Company’s ability to compete is its ongoing focus on efficiency and productivity, as lower costs give the Company greater flexibility in its approach to pricing and investing for growth. Management believes that this flexibility remains important in light of the competitive environment, in which a number of competitors offer reduced online trading commission rates and low expense ratios on certain classes of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Additionally, the Company’s nationwide marketing effort is an important competitive tool because it reinforces the attributes of the Schwab

®

brand.

The Company’s earnings growth strategy is based upon the belief that developing trusted

relationships with client

s will lead to strong business performance. The Company has

been

and continues

to be committed to offering its

clients more value and a

better investing experience which the Company

believe

s

will translate into more assets from both

new and existing clients

which ultimately dr

ive revenue in terms of asset management and administration fees,

net interest revenue

and trading revenue

.

Sources of Net Revenues

The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates the majority of asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund and ETF offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. A portion of asset management and administration fees comes from client cash balances placed in the Company’s money market mutual funds. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest generated on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources, the majority of which is derived from client cash balances in deposit and brokerage accounts. The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue earned primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities.

Regulation

As a participant in the securities, banking and financial services industries, the Company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities, and self-regulatory organizations (SROs). The Company is also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which the Company operates. These regulations affect the Company’s business operations and impose capital, client protection and market conduct requirements.

The financial services industry has been subject to enhanced levels of regulatory oversight in recent years, and the Company expects this trend to continue for the foreseeable future. As a result of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 (Dodd-Frank), the adoption of implementing regulations by the federal regulatory agencies, and other recent regulatory reforms, the Company has experienced significant changes in the laws and regulations that apply to it, how it is regulated, and regulatory expectations in the areas of compliance, risk management, corporate governance, operations, capital and liquidity.

Holding Company and Bank Regulation

CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution subsidiary, is a federal savings bank. CSC is regulated, examined and supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), and Schwab Bank is regulated, examined and supervised by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC),

-


-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). CSC and Schwab Bank are also subject to regulation and various requirements and restrictions under state and other federal laws.

This regulatory structure establishes a comprehensive framework designed to protect depositors and consumers, the safety and soundness of depository institutions and their holding companies, and the stability of the banking system as a whole. This framework affects the activities and investments of CSC, Schwab Bank and CSC’s non-bank subsidiaries and gives the regulatory authorities broad discretion in connection with their supervisory, examination and enforcement activities and policies.

Financial Regulatory Reform

As a result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank, the adoption by the federal banking agencies of implementing regulations and other regulatory reforms, the financial services industry is currently experiencing a period of unprecedented change in financial regulation. The changes that have been enacted under Dodd-Frank and other regulatory reforms that are significant for CSC and Schwab Bank are highlighted below.

Basel III Capital and Liquidity Framework

In July 2013, the U.S. Federal banking agencies finalized a rule to implement strengthened regulatory capital requirements for U.S. banking organizations consistent with Basel III (Final Regulatory Capital Rules). The Final Regulatory Capital Rules established Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital as a new capital standard, increased minimum required risk-based capital ratios, narrowed the eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, provided for new regulatory capital deductions and adjustments, and modified methods for calculating risk-weighted assets (the denominator of risk-based capital ratios). See

“Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity” and “Capital Management,” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 23. Regulatory Requirements”

for the new capital ratio requirements.

The Final Regulatory Capital Rules provided for a one-time election which CSC and Schwab Bank made to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) from the calculation of CET1 Capital. The Final Regulatory Capital Rules also introduced a capital conservation buffer that limits a banking organization’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers if a banking organization fails to maintain a capital conservation buffer of more than 2.5%, on a fully phased-in basis, in excess of all of its minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements.

The Final Regulatory Capital Rules provide for a “standardized approach” framework for the calculation of a banking organization’s regulatory capital and risk-weighted assets. Depository institutions and their holding companies with consolidated total assets of $250 billion or more, or total on-balance-sheet foreign exposures of $10 billion or more, are also required to calculate their regulatory capital requirements using an “advanced approaches” framework to determine their risk-weighted assets. Such companies must also maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of at least 3.0% and are subject to certain other enhanced provisions. CSC and Schwab Bank are currently only subject to the “standardized approach” framework.

The new capital requirements under the Final Regulatory Capital Rules became effective on January 1, 2015, for CSC, which had not previously been subject to any consolidated capital requirements, and Schwab Bank. The required minimum capital conservation buffer is being phased in incrementally; it started at .625% on January 1, 2016 and will increase to 1.25% on January 1, 2017, 1.875% on January 1, 2018 and 2.5% on January 1, 2019.

In September 2014, U.S. Federal banking agencies issued an inter-agency final rule that imposes a quantitative liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement on large banking organizations. The purpose of the LCR is to require banking organizations to hold minimum amounts of high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) based on a percentage of their projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period. Banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or foreign exposures of $10 billion or more must hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 100% of their projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period. Other bank and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as CSC, are subject to a modified LCR rule requiring them to hold HQLA in an amount equal to at least 70% of their projected net cash outflows over a 30-day period. The modified LCR rule went into effect on January 1, 2016, with holding companies subject to the rule required to hold at least 90% of the necessary amount of HQLA in 2016 and at least 100% starting on January 1, 2017.

Capital Stress Testing

In October 2012, the OCC issued final rules implementing provisions of Dodd-Frank that require national banks and federal savings banks with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct annual company-run stress tests. Under the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Test (D-FAST) rules, Schwab Bank must conduct annual stress tests using certain scenarios and prescribed stress-testing methodologies, report the results to the OCC and the Federal Reserve and publish a summary of the results of its stress tests. In March 2015, Schwab Bank submitted its company-run stress test results to the OCC. In June 2015 Schwab Bank publicly disclosed a summary of its stress test results under the severely adverse scenario prescribed by the OCC based upon a nine-quarter timeframe beginning on October 1, 2014 and ending on December 31, 2016. In its summary, Schwab Bank reported that its 7.2%

Tier 1 leverage ratio at the beginning of the forecast period declined to a low of 6.5% during the nine-quarter forecast horizon and was 7.0% at the end.

Under the final Federal Reserve D-FAST regulations, CSC will be required to conduct its first stress test using financial statement data as of December 31, 2016, report the results of that stress test to the Federal Reserve by April 5, 2017, and publicly disclose a summary of its stress test results between June 15 and June 30, 2017. CSC is not subject to the annual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) process, which requires certain financial institutions to submit annual capital plans to the Federal Reserve. However, CSC is taking steps to implement policies, procedures, systems and governance structures that are designed to be consistent with regulatory expectations for a firm of its size and complexity.

Insured Depository Institution Resolution Plans

In September 2011 and January 2012, the FDIC issued interim final and final rules requiring insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to submit to the FDIC periodic plans providing for their resolution by the FDIC in the event of failure (resolution plans or so-called “living wills”) under the receivership and liquidation provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. Under these rules, Schwab Bank is required to file with the FDIC an annual resolution plan demonstrating how the bank could be resolved in an orderly and timely manner in the event of receivership such that the FDIC would be able: to ensure that the bank’s depositors receive access to their deposits within one business day; to maximize the net present value of the bank’s assets when disposed of; and to minimize losses incurred by the bank’s creditors. Schwab Bank submitted its most recent resolution plan to the FDIC on December 31, 2015.

Consumer Financial Protection

In July 2011, pursuant to Dodd-Frank, the CFPB began operations and was given rulemaking authority for a wide range of federal consumer protection laws as well as broad powers to supervise compliance with and enforce those laws. As a federal savings bank with $10 billion or more in consolidated total assets, Schwab Bank is subject to examination, supervision and regulation by the CFPB. The CFPB has proposed and finalized many consumer protection rules since its creation and has authority to promulgate regulations, issue orders, draft policy statements, conduct examinations and bring enforcement actions. The creation of the CFPB has led to enhanced enforcement of consumer protection laws. Although the ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain, it could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

The FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) provides insurance coverage for certain deposits, generally up to $250,000 per depositor per account ownership type, and is funded by quarterly assessments on insured depository institutions. In February 2011, the FDIC established a risk-based deposit premium assessment system that, for large insured depository institutions with at least $10 billion in total consolidated assets, such as Schwab Bank, uses a scorecard method based on a number of factors, including the institution’s regulatory ratings, asset quality and brokered deposits. The deposit insurance assessment base is calculated as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity.

The Dodd-Frank Act (i) raised the minimum reserve ratio for the DIF to 1.35% (from the former minimum of 1.15%) and (ii) required that the DIF’s reserve ratio reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020.

In October 2015, the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would impose a flat-rate surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or more to pay for the increase. See

Community Reinvestment Act

The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (CRA) requires Schwab Bank’s primary federal bank regulatory agency, the OCC, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” This assessment is reviewed in connection with any acquisition, merger or branch office application.

Source of Strength

The Dodd-Frank Act codified the Federal Reserve’s long-held position that a depository institution holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary depository institutions, the so-called “source of strength doctrine.” In effect, the holding company may be compelled to commit resources to support the subsidiary in the event the subsidiary is in financial distress. It is anticipated that in 2016 the Federal Reserve will issue guidance as to how it will implement and apply the doctrine in situations where a holding company’s depository institution subsidiaries are in a troubled condition.

Broker-Dealer and Investment Advisor Regulation

CSC’s principal broker-dealers are Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. Schwab is registered as a broker-dealer with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fifty states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. optionsXpress, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Schwab and CSIM are registered as investment advisors with the SEC. Additionally, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with respect to the commodity futures and commodities trading activities they conduct as an introducing broker and futures commission merchant, respectively.

Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to SROs. Schwab is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), NYSE Arca, and the Chicago Board Options Exchange. optionsXpress, Inc. is also a member of FINRA and the MSRB. In addition to the SEC, the primary regulators of Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. are FINRA and, for municipal securities, the MSRB. The National Futures Association (NFA) is Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc.’s primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities.

The principal purpose of regulating broker-dealers and investment advisors is the protection of clients and the securities markets. The regulations cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales and trading practices, publication of research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements, disclosure to clients, fiduciary duties owed to advisory clients, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.

Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. are both subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule) and related SRO requirements. The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. CSC itself is not a registered broker-dealer and it is not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule. However, if Schwab fails to maintain specified levels of net capital, such failure could constitute a default by CSC of certain debt covenants under its credit agreement.

The Uniform Net Capital Rule prohibits a broker-dealer subsidiary from paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or repaying subordinated loans to its parent company if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000.

In addition to net capital requirements, as self-clearing broker-dealers, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. are subject to cash deposit and collateral requirements with clearing houses, such as the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation and Options Clearing Corporation, which may fluctuate significantly from time to time based upon the nature and size of clients’ trading activity and market volatility.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The Company faces a variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results, and many of those risks are driven by factors that the Company cannot control or predict. The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant, although there may be other risks that could arise, or may prove to be more significant than expected, that may affect the Company’s operations or financial results.

For a discussion of the Company’s risk management, including operational risk, credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, compliance risk, and legal risk, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Risk Management.”

Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the Company’s business.

The Company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment – economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates and overall investor engagement, and are outside of the Company’s control. Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reductions

in short-term interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and capital resources.

Extensive regulation of the Company’s businesses affects the Company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties.

As a participant in the securities, banking and financial services industries, the Company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities and SROs. Such regulation continues to grow more extensive and complex, the costs and uncertainty related to complying with such regulations continue to increase, and regulatory proceedings continue to become more frequent and sanctions more severe. The requirements imposed by the Company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets, the safety and soundness of financial institutions and the protection of clients. These regulations affect the Company’s business operations and impose capital, client protection and market conduct requirements.

In addition to specific banking laws and regulations, the Company’s banking regulators have broad discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies and could require CSC and/or Schwab Bank to hold more capital, increase liquidity or limit their ability to pay dividends or CSC’s ability to repurchase shares. The banking regulators could also limit the Company’s ability to grow, including adding assets, launching new products, and undertaking strategic investments, could limit Schwab Bank’s ability to accept deposits swept from the client brokerage accounts and could prevent the Company from pursuing its business strategy.

Despite the Company’s efforts to comply with applicable legal requirements, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable laws or regulations may be unclear or where regulators could revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the Company’s regulators against the Company or its affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities, any of which could harm the Company’s reputation and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

While the Company maintains systems and procedures designed to ensure that it complies with applicable laws and regulations, violations could occur. In addition, some legal/regulatory frameworks provide for the imposition of fines or penalties for noncompliance even though the noncompliance was inadvertent or unintentional and even though systems and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations were in place at the time. There may be other negative consequences resulting from a finding of noncompliance, including restrictions on certain activities. Such a finding may also damage the Company’s reputation and its relationships with its regulators and could restrict the ability of institutional investment managers to invest in the Company’s securities.

Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively affect the Company’s business and financial results.

New legislation, rules, regulations and guidance, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing federal, state and SRO rules, regulations and guidance, including changes relating to mutual funds, broker-dealer fiduciary duties and regulatory treatment of deposit accounts may directly affect the operation and profitability of the Company or its specific business lines. The profitability of the Company could also be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data.

In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the Company conducts, modifications to the Company’s business practices, increased capital requirements or additional costs.

Financial reforms and related regulations may affect the Company’s business activities, financial position and profitability.

There have been extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms as a result of the enactment of Dodd-Frank and the adoption by the federal banking agencies of regulations implementing Dodd-Frank and other reforms such as Basel III. Among the changes that are most likely to impact the Company’s business and financial results are: increased capital, liquidity and reporting requirements; increased deposit insurance assessments; the establishment of the CFPB, which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer financial products; the requirement for Schwab Bank (and CSC starting in 2017) to conduct annual capital adequacy stress tests; and discretion given to the SEC to adopt

-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

rules regarding standards of conduct for broker-dealers providing investment advice to retail clients. The Company has incurred and will continue to incur significant additional costs and expend a significant amount of time as it develops and integrates appropriate systems and procedures, and then monitors, supports and refines those systems and procedures.

While U.S. banking regulators have finalized many regulations to implement various provisions of Dodd-Frank and Basel III, implementation of the legislation is ongoing and significant rule-making and interpretations remain to be completed. For example, rules relating to a minimum net stable funding ratio,

which will require financial institutions to have a stable funding structure over a one-year horizon, have not yet been proposed.

Future regulatory changes or revised guidance and interpretations may impact the profitability of the Company’s business activities, require changes to certain of its business practices, impose upon the Company more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect the Company’s ability to pursue its business strategies. These changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes to its compliance, risk management and operations functions.

Failure to meet capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines could affect the Company’s financial condition.

CSC, together with Schwab Bank and its broker-dealer subsidiaries, must meet certain capital and liquidity standards, subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits Schwab’s ability to transfer capital to CSC and other affiliates. New regulatory capital, liquidity, and stress testing requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how the Company utilizes its capital, including paying dividends and stock repurchases, and may require the Company to increase its capital and/or liquidity or to limit its growth. Any requirement that the Company increase its regulatory capital, replace certain capital instruments which presently qualify as Tier 1 capital, or increase regulatory capital ratios or liquidity, could require the Company to liquidate assets, deleverage or otherwise change its business and/or investment plans, which may adversely affect its financial results. Issuing additional common stock would dilute the ownership of existing stockholders.

If the Company’s consolidated total assets equal or exceed $250 billion, the Company would become subject to the advanced approaches framework of the Basel III capital and liquidity requirements, including being subject to a supplementary leverage ratio, the inclusion of AOCI in regulatory capital, and the unmodified LCR and enhanced Basel III disclosures. In addition, federal banking agencies have broad discretion and could require CSC or Schwab Bank to hold higher levels of capital or increase liquidity above the applicable regulatory requirements.

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve and OCC issued Final Regulatory Capital Rules, which established more restrictive capital definitions, higher risk-weightings for certain asset classes, higher minimum capital ratios and capital buffers. Failure by either CSC or Schwab Bank to meet its minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory, and additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a negative impact on the Company. In addition, failure by CSC or Schwab Bank to maintain a sufficient amount of capital to satisfy its capital conservation buffer requirements (as phased in) would result in restrictions on the Company’s ability to make capital distributions and discretionary cash bonus payments to executive officers.

Further, in September 2014, the Federal Reserve issued a modified LCR that requires CSC to maintain a sufficient amount of

.

For a discussion of the Company’s Liquidity and Capital Management, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity” and “Capital Management,”

and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements – 23. Regulatory Requirements.”

Technology and operational failures or errors could subject the Company to losses, litigation, and regulatory actions.

The Company faces operational risk, which is the potential for loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, and firms or exchanges handling client orders, or from external events and relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and vendors. This risk also includes the risk of human error, execution errors, errors in models such as those used for asset management, capital planning and management, risk management, stress testing and compliance, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, power outage, capacity constraints, software flaws and similar events. For example, the Company and other financial institutions have been the target of various denial of service attacks that have, in certain circumstances,

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

made websites, mobile applications and email unavailable for periods of time. It could take an extended period of time to restore full functionality to the Company’s technology or other operating systems in the event of an unforeseen event which could affect the Company’s ability to process and settle client transactions. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct, might also negatively impact the Company’s reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. Despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology or other operational failures or errors, including those of its vendors or other third parties.

While the Company devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of its systems, extraordinary trading volumes could cause the Company’s computer systems to operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting the Company’s ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. Disruptions in service and slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction. The Company is also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client orders are routed for execution and settlement. Systems failures and constraints and transaction errors at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices, cause substantial losses for the Company and for its clients, and subject the Company to claims from its clients for damages.

A significant decrease in the

Company’s liquidity could negatively affect the Company’s business and financial management as well as reduce client confidence in the Company.

Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the Company, including margin lending, mortgage lending, and transaction settlement, among other liquidity needs. The Company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings, as well as cash provided by external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as changes in regulatory treatment of client deposits or market conditions, may affect the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs. A reduction in the Company’s liquidity position could reduce client confidence in the Company, which could result in the loss of client accounts, or could cause the Company to fail to satisfy its liquidity requirements. In addition, if the Company’s broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC, which could reduce CSC’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such subsidiaries.

Factors which may adversely affect the Company’s liquidity position include fluctuations in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in the Company’s client lending activities (including margin, mortgage-related, and personal lending), unanticipated outflows of company cash, increased capital requirements, changes in regulatory guidance or interpretations, other regulatory changes, or a loss of market or client confidence in the Company. Schwab may also experience temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between brokerage transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances.

When cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the Company’s liquidity needs, the Company must seek external financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC and Schwab maintain committed and uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC which can be used to sell securities, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.

The Company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures.

The Company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client, counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies and procedures may not be fully effective. The Company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending, clients’ options trading, securities lending, mortgage lending, pledged asset

-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

lending, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds the Company sponsors.

When clients purchase securities on margin, borrow on lines of credit collateralized by securities, or trade options or futures, the Company is subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the securities and cash in their accounts falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses.

The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper among other investments. These instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of issuer credit quality, increases in the unemployment rate, delinquency and default rates, housing price declines, changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors. A failure to raise the U.S. debt limit and/or a downgrade of the U.S. government’s credit rating could decrease the value of the Company’s securities in both the available for sale and held to maturity portfolios.

Loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired. The evaluation of whether other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of several factors. If management determines that a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings. Deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. See “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates.”

The Company’s bank loans primarily consist of First Mortgages, HELOCs, and PALs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing and stock price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves and write downs on such loans.

Heightened credit exposures to specific counterparties or instruments (concentration risk) can increase the Company’s risk of loss. Examples of the Company’s credit concentration risk include:

·

large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry;

·

mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and

·

margin, pledged asset, and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry.

The Company may also be subject to concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty, borrower or issuer.

The Company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although the Company has no obligation to do so, the Company may decide for competitive or other reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause the Company to take significant charges, could reduce the Company’s liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in the Company having to consolidate a supported fund in its financial statements. If the Company chose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, the Company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.

Significant interest rate changes could affect the Company’s profitability

and

financial condition.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest-earning assets (such as cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, and mortgage and margin loans) relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources (including bank deposits and cash in brokerage accounts, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt). Changes in interest rates can affect the interest earned on interest-earning assets differently than the interest the Company pays on its interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary. Overall, the Company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment; the Company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest rates if the rates the Company earns on interest-earning assets decline more than

-


-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

the rates that the Company pays on its funding sources, or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgage-backed securities the Company holds. The Company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce interest rates on funding sources, such as deposit accounts, and still offer a competitive return.

As a result of the low interest rate environment, the Company has been waiving and may continue to waive a portion of its management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds. To the extent the overall yield on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds remains at or below the management fees on those funds, the Company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients. Such fee waivers negatively impact the Company’s asset management and administration fee revenues.

Security breaches of the Company’s systems, or those of its clients or third parties, may subject the Company to significant liability and damage the Company’s reputation.

The Company’s business involves the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential information about the Company and its clients. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties. The Company’s systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite the Company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the Company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means, for example, employee misconduct.

Security breaches, including breaches of the Company’s security measures or those of the Company’s third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject the Company to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by the Company’s regulators, damage to the Company’s reputation, or a loss of confidence in the Company’s security measures which could harm the Company’s business. The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.

The Company also faces risk related to external fraud involving the compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices that can facilitate the unauthorized access to login and password information for their various online financial accounts, including those at the Company. Such risk has grown in recent years due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties, including foreign state-sponsored parties. For example, these parties send fraudulent “phishing” emails to the Company’s clients in order to misappropriate user names, passwords or other personal information. Losses reimbursed to clients under the Company’s guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending itself against claims or proceedings.

The financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory risks. The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.

Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by the Company’s clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at the Company. Claims from clients of third party advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant Company resources. If the Company were found to have infringed on a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, it could incur substantial damages, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Actions brought against the Company may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Company including reputational harm. Even if the Company is successful in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in the Company incurring significant expenses. Predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult, particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes of claimants, claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages, or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to the Company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on the Company’s results for that period. In market downturns, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services companies have historically increased. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 15. Commitments and Contingencies.”

The Company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.

The Company relies on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of the Company’s confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause the Company to incur losses and could harm the Company’s reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason, and the Company’s inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt the Company’s operations, impact the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to the Company. Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations.

Potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial position.

The Company evaluates potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of evaluating, negotiating, and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. In addition, an acquisition may cause the Company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings. Further, the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits from an acquisition, and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the Company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share.

The Company’s acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold. To the extent the Company enters into an agreement to buy or sell an entity, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, the Company’s stock price could decline.

The Company’s industry is characterized by aggressive price competition

.

The Company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically adjusts trade commission rates, interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms, such as reduced commissions to attract trading volume or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances, could impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition. To the extent that any of the Company’s competitors acquires or is acquired by another institution, that firm may be able to offer products and services at lower prices and/or promote those products and services more aggressively.

The Company faces competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees, especially for employees who are key to the Company’s ability to build and enhance client relationships.

The market for quality professionals and other personnel in the Company’s business is highly competitive. Competition is strong for FCs who build and sustain the Company’s client relationships and for certain risk and capital management talent.

-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

The Company’s ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.

The Company’s stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate.

The Company’s stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of the Company’s stock price are the following:

·

the Company’s exposure to changes in interest rates;

·

speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, the Company’s competitive position, organizational structure, executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, expense discipline, or strategic transactions;

·

the announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by the Company or its competitors; and

·

increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and actual financial results.

Changes in the stock market generally, or as it concerns the Company’s industry, as well as geopolitical, corporate, regulatory, business, and economic factors may also affect the Company’s stock price.

Future sales of CSC’s equity securities may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock and result in dilution.

CSC’s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC’s Board of Directors to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into equity securities, without stockholder approval. CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially dilutive to holders of CSC’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

OVERVIEW

Management of the Company focuse

s on several key client activity

and financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. Management believes that net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, earnings per common share (EPS), and return on

average

common stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Expenses excluding interest as a percentage of average client assets are considered by management to be a measure of operating efficiency. Results for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 are:

(1)

2015 excludes an inflow of $6.1 billion to reflect the final impact of the consolidation of its retirement plan recordkeeping platforms, an inflow of $10.2 million relating to a mutual fund clearing services client, and an outflow of $11.6 billion relating to the Company’s planned resignation from an Advisor Services cash management relationship netting to an adjustment of ($4.7) billion.

(2)

2013 excludes an outflow of $74.5 billion relating to the planned transfer of a mutual fund clearing client and $24.7 billion to reflect the estimated impact of the consolidation of its retirement plan recordkeeping technology platforms and subsequent resignation from certain retirement plan clients for a total adjustment of $99.2 billion.

The Company’s financial results are highly correlated to the general overall strength of economic conditions and, more specifically, to the direction of the U.S. equity and fixed income markets, the mortgage lending markets and residential credit trends. Overall market conditions, interest rates, economic, political and regulatory trends, and industry competition are among the factors that could affect results and which are unpredictable

.

Interest rates have a direct correlation to the Company’s ability to generate net interest revenue, as interest-earning assets and funding sources are sensitive to changes in the rate environment.

To the extent short-term interest rates remain at current low levels, the Company’s net interest revenue will continue to be constrained, even as growth in average balances helps to

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

increase such revenue. Net interest revenue is also impacted by the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing funding sources, as well as the Company’s ability to attract assets from new and existing clients.

The interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees through

the fees earned on the Company’s lineup of proprietary money market funds

.

I

n 2015, 2014 and 2013, the low interest rate environment caused the Company to waive a portion of its money fund fees. To the extent that short-term rates remain low, asset management and administration fees may continue to be negatively affected. Other drivers of asset management and administration fees include securities valuations and the Company’s ability to attract assets from new and existing clients.

The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities. Trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. Volatility in the markets can influence client behavior in terms of investment decisions and volume of trading activity.

2015 Compared to 2014

In 2015, the

Company’s

revenue and net i

ncome grew despite an environment that included significant equity market volatility and continued low interest rates. The

Standard & Poor’

s 500 Index declined as much as 9% during the year and ultimately ended

the year

down 1%

when compared to the prior year.

The federal funds short-term target rate increased 25 basis points in December 2015, however, the increase had limited effect on 2015 results.

The average 3-month

London Interbank Offered Rate (

U.S. Treasury

yield during 2015 was

2.13

%

,


basis points lower t

han the average yield during

2014.

Strong client momentum continued as the Company’s innovative, full-service model continued to resonate with clients and drive growth during the year. Core net new assets totaled $

134.7

billion in 2015 compared to $

124.8

billion in 2014. Total client assets ended 2015 at $

2.51

trillion

,

up


% from

the year ended 2014, despite

the $

billion impact of reduced

market valuation on client assets during the year.

The Company added

1.1 million

new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2015, up


% compared to 2014. Active brokerage accounts ended 2015 at

9.8

million, up


% on a year-over-year basis. Faced with economic uncertainty and the resulting market volatility, investors increasingly turned to advice offerings th

roughout the year. Over

during

2015,


% more than the year-earlier period, and total accounts using these solutions reached

560,000, up


% year-over-year.

During 2015, the Company’s net revenues increased

Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher

.

·

Asset management and administration fees increased due to higher client as

and higher net yields earned on money market funds.

·

Trading revenue decreased for 2015 primarily due to

lower commissions per revenue trade and lower daily average revenue trades

.

Growth in expenses, excluding interest, was limited to a 4

%

increase

in 2015

primarily reflecting business growth related increases in compensation, benefits and other expenses.

The combined effect of market conditions, strong business growth, and the Company’s overall spending discipline resulted in a pre-tax profit margin of

35.7

in 2015

.

2014 Compared to 2013

The Company operated in an environment of mixed market conditions during 2014 compared to 2013, as the Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average showed periods of volatility before

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

ending the year up 13%, 11%, and 8%, respectively. The federal funds target rate remained u

nchanged at a range of zero to

.25% during 2014. The average 10-year

U.S.

Treasury yield increased by 20 basis points to 2.53% during 2014 compared to 2013, while the yield ended the year down 86 basis points to 2.17%. In the same period, the average three-month

U.S.

Treasury Bill yield

decreased by 3 basis points to

.02%.

The Company’s steady focus on serving investor needs through its full-service investing model continued to drive growth during 2014. Total client assets ended the year at $2.46 trillion, up 10% from 2013, reflecting net new client assets of $124.8 billion and a rising equity market environment. In addition, the Company added almost 1 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2014. Active brokerage accounts reached 9.4 million in 2014, up 3% from 2013.

As a result of the Company’s strong key client activity metrics, the Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin of 34.9% in 2014. Overall, net income increased by 23% in 2014 from 2013 and the return on average common stockholders’ equity was 12% in 2014.

Overall, net revenues increased by 11% in 2014 from 2013, primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administrati

on fees, and other revenue.

·

Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher balances of interest-earning assets, including margin loans and the Company’s investment portfolio (securities available for sale and securities held to maturity), and the effect higher average interest rates on securities held to maturity had on the Company’s average net interest margin.

·

Asset management and administration fees increased due to fees from mutual fund services, advice solutions, and other asset management and administration services.

·

Other r

evenue

increased primarily due to a net insurance settlement of $45 million, net litigation proceeds of $28 million related to the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities

(RMBS)

portfolio, and increases in order flow revenue.

Expenses excluding interest increased by 6% in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense as a result of a charge of $68 million for estimated future severance benefits resulting from changes in the Company’s geographic footprint and an increase in professional services expense.

Current Regulatory Environment and Other Developments

In December 2015, the OCC issued proposed guidelines to establish standards for recovery planning by national banks and federal savings banks with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The proposed guidelines would require each bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan that sets forth the bank’s plan for how it will remain a going concern when it is experiencing considerable financial or operational stress. The comment period for the proposed guidelines ended on February 16, 2016 and the guidelines are subject to further modification. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed guidelines.

In October 2015, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would require certain financial institutions that are subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital rules to apply a regulatory capital deduction treatment to their investments in unsecured debt issued by U.S. bank holding companies identified as global systemically important banking organizations. The comment period for the rule proposal ended on February 19, 2016 and the rule proposal is subject to further modification. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the proposed rule.

In October 2015, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose a surcharge on the quarterly assessments of insured depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or more. The surcharge would equal an annual rate of 4.5 basis points applied to the institution’s assessment base, with certain adjustments. The FDIC expects the proposed surcharge to commence in the third quarter of 2016 and continue through the quarter that the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches 1.35%. Under the proposed rule, if by year-end 2018, the reserve ratio has not reached 1.35%, the FDIC would impose a shortfall assessment on the institutions subject to the surcharge.

The

comment period for the rule proposal ended on January 5, 2016 and the rule proposal is subject to further modification.

The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of

the proposed rule.

In April 2015, the Department of Labor published notice of a rule proposal to significantly broaden the definition of “fiduciary” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. If adopted, among other things, the new rule would subject broker-dealers who provide non-discretionary investment advice to retirement plans and accounts to a “best interest” standard, as well as other conditions and requirements. The second comment period for the rule proposal ended on September 24, 2015 and the rule proposal is subject to further modification. The Company will continue to evaluate the impact of the proposed rule.

Net Interest Revenue

Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources.

The Company’s interest-earning assets are primarily funded through bank deposits and brokerage client account balances.

Interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents, segregated cash and investments, margin loans included in receivables from brokerage clients, investment securities and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors such as distribution and composition of assets, prevailing interest rates when purchased, and changes in prepayment levels. Fees earned on securities borrowed and loaned are included in other interest revenue and expense. The rates on the majority of the Company’s investment securities and loans re-price or reset based on short-term market rates and the remainder is invested in fixed-rate loans and securities.

The Company’s interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients and long-term debt. Interest-bearing liabilities are primarily sensitive to short-term interest rates and the Company establishes the rates paid on most of these liabilities. The Company expects that the rate paid on these liabilities will generally adjust at some fraction of the movement in short-term market rates.

The Company expects

that

net interest revenue will increase as short-term market rates increase and decline should rates fall below current levels. When interest rates fall, the Company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense on funding sources. The Company may also alter the amount and type of fixed rate loans and securities that are added to the portfolio. Generally, increases in the percentage of fixed-rate assets relative to non-interest-bearing liabilities will reduce the rate at which net interest revenue changes if rates move.

Non-interest bearing funding sources include non-interest bearing cash balances, stockholders’ equity and other miscellaneous assets and liabilities.

Trading Revenue

Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity

in

client

fixed income securities. Factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of client trades and market price volatility.

To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, the Company maintains positions in fixed income securities, including

U.S.

state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government, corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value

of these securities positions.

Order flow revenue was $103 million during 2015 compared to $114 million during 2014. The decrease was primarily due to changes in the composition and volume of different types of orders and the fees and rebates for such orders. Other revenue in 2015 also includes net litigation proceeds of $75 million related to the Company’s non-agency RMBS portfolio. Other revenue in 2014 includes a net insurance settlement of $45 million and net litigation proceeds of $28 million related to the Company’s non-agency RMBS portfolio.

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and rel

ated employee benefits and other

. Incentive compensation includes variable compensation, discretionary bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Variable compensation includes payments to certain individuals based on their sales performance. Discretionary bonuses are based on the Company’s overall performance as measured by

EPS

, and therefore fluctuate with this measure. Stock-based compensation primarily includes employee and board of director stock options and restricted stock.

The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data:

Salaries and wages increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to higher employee headcount and annual salary increases, partially offset by a $68 million charge in 2014 for estimated future severance benefits resulting from changes in the Company’s geographic footprint. Incentive compensation increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to the earlier recognition of certain equity-based incentives due to plan changes offset by a reduction in long-term incentive plan expenses. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2015 from 2014 due to increases in healthcare costs and higher employee headcount.

Salaries and wages increased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to a $68 million charge in 2014 for estimated future severance benefits resulting from changes in the Company’s geographic footprint and due to annual salary increases. Incentive compensation was relatively flat in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to an increase in discretionary bonus costs, offset by a higher 2013 expense related to a new payout schedule for field incentive plans.

Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits

Professional services remained relatively flat in 2015 compared to 2014. Professional services expense increased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to higher spending on technology services and an increase in fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants.

Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increased software maintenance expense relating to the Company’s information technology systems and an increase in property taxes and other expenses attributable to the changes in the Company’s geographic footprint.

Depreciation and amortization expense increased in 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to increased amortization of internally-developed software associated with the Company’s investment in software and technology enhancements and increased depreciation related to new buildings and equipment associated with the Company’s expanded geographic footprint. Depreciation and amortization expense remained relatively flat in 2014 compared to 2013.

The Company’s capital expenditures were $285 million (5% of net revenues), $405 million (7% of net revenues), and $270 million (5% of net revenues) in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures in 2015 from 2014 was primarily due to lower investment in buildings and land relating to the change in the Company’s geographic footprint. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software were $107 million, $81 million and $74 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Management currently anticipates that 2016 capital expenditures will be approximately 46% higher than 2015 primarily due to spending on land, leasehold improvements, information technology equipment and capitalized costs for internal use software.

Other expense increased in 2015 from 2014 primarily due to increases in FDIC insurance assessments due to higher bank deposits, legal expenses and miscellaneous items. Other expense increased in 2014 from 2013 primarily due to higher travel costs as a result of increased employee headcount and travel.

Taxes on Income

Risk

MANAGEMENT

The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, compliance and legal risk. The Company has a comprehensive risk management program to identify and manage these risks and their associated potential for financial and reputational impact. Despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to these risks.

The Company’s risk management process is comprised of risk identification and assessment, risk measurement, risk monitoring and reporting and risk mitigation. The activities and organizations that comprise the risk management process are described below.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

Risk Culture

The Board of Directors has approved an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that incorporates the Company’s purpose, vision and values to form the bedrock of its risk culture and set the tone for the organization.

The ERM Framework and governance structure constitute a comprehensive approach to managing risks encountered by the Company in its business activities.

The

f

ramework

incorporates key concepts commensurate with

the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company.

Risk appetite, which is defined as the amount of risk the Company is willing to accept in pursuit of its corporate strategy, is set by executive management and approved by the Board of Directors

.

Risk Governance

Senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring and controlling risks.

The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior

executives

from each

major business and control

function

, is responsible for

the oversight of risk management. This includes identifying emerging risks, assessing risk management practices and the control environment, reinforcing business accountability for risk management, supervisory controls and regulatory compliance, supporting resource prioritization across the Company, and escalating significant issues to the Board of Directors

.

The Company has established risk metrics and reporting that enable measurement of the impact of strategy execution against risk appetite. The risk metrics, with risk limits and tolerance levels, are established for key risk categories by the Global Risk Committee and its functional risk sub-committees.

The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. The Risk Committee in turn assists the Board of Directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to the Company’s risk management program, including approving risk appetite statements and reviewing reports relating to risk issues from functional areas of risk management, legal, compliance, and internal audit.

Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report to the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include the:

·

Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which

establishes strategies and policies for the management of corporate

capital

,

liquidity

, interest rate risk, and investments;

·

Compliance Risk Committee, which provides oversight of compliance risk management programs and policies providing an aggregate view of compliance risk exposure;

·

Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which

provides oversight of and approves

credit

and market risk policies, limits, and

exposures

in loan, investment, and positioning portfolios

;

·

New Products

and

Services

Risk Oversight Committee

, which

provides oversight of, and approves corporate policy and procedures relating to the risk governance of new products and services

;

and the

·

Operational Risk Oversight Committee, which provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and operational risk governance processes, and includes the following sub

-

committees:

o

Client Fiduciary Risk Sub-Committee, which provides oversight of fiduciary risk throughout the Company;

o

Global Data Subcommittee, which oversees and approves corporate policies and standards related to enterprise data governance;

o

Information Security and Privacy

Sub-

Committee, which

provides oversight

of the

information

and cyber

security and privacy

programs and

policies;

o

Model Governance

Sub-

Committee, which provides oversight of model risk throughout the Company

; and the

o

Vendor Management Sub-Committee, which provides oversight of the Company’s vendor management and outsourcing program and policies.

Senior management has also created an Incentive Compensation Risk Oversight Committee, which establishes policy and reviews and approves the Annual Risk Assessment of incentive compensation plans, and reports directly to the Board Compensation Committee.

The Company’s compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management.

In addition, the Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

Operational Risk

Operational

risks

arise due to potentially

inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events and relationships impacting

the Company

and/or any of its key business partners and vendors. Operational risk includes

fiduciary, information security, legal, and model risk

, and each

is

also describe

d in detail below.

The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms.

Operational risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses,

cyber

attacks, terrorist attacks, and natural disaster

s

. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase.

Operational risk is mitigated through a system of internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to keep operational risk and operational losses at levels appropriate to the inherent risk of the business in which the Company operates. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data.

Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.

The Company also faces operational risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security.

The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts.

Fiduciary Risk

Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial

or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.

Information Security Risk

Information Security risk is the potential for unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction of the firm’s information or systems. The Company has designed and implemented a security program that knits together complementary tools, controls and technologies to protect

systems,

client accounts and data. The Company continuously monitors the systems and works collaboratively with government agencies, law enforcement and other financial

institutions

to address potential threats. The Company uses advanced

monitoring

systems to

identify

suspicious activity and deter unauthorized access

by internal or external actors

. The Company limits the number of employees who have access to clients’ personal information and enforces internal authentication measures to protect against the potential for social engineering. All employees who handle sensitive information are trained in privacy and security.

Schwab’s fraud and Cyber security teams monitor activity looking for suspicious behavior. These capabilities allow the Company to identify and quickly act on any attempted intrusions.

Legal Risk

Legal risk is the risk of a claim for damages or other relief brought by clients, employees or third parties, alleging a breach of legal requirements or other duties under law. This risk may occur as a result of operational failure but may also occur as a result of other factors. The financial services industry is subject to substantial litigation risk, and the firm incurs legal claims in the ordinary course of business. Increased litigation costs or substantial legal liability relating to an extraordinary claim or incidence of claims could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition. For information about the Company’s legal risk, see “Item 1A – Risk Factors,” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 15. Commitments and Contingencies.”

Model Risk

Model risk is the potential for adverse consequences from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs and reports. Models are owned by several business units throughout the Company, and are used for a variety of purposes. Model use includes, but is not limited to, calculating capital requirements for hypothetical stressful environments, estimating interest and credit risk for loans and other balance sheet assets, and providing guidance in the management of client portfolios. The Company has established a policy to describe the roles and responsibilities of all key stakeholders in model development, management, and use. All models at the Company are registered in a centralized database and classified into different risk ratings depending on their potential financial, reputational, or regulatory impact to the Company. The model risk rating informs the scope of all model governance activities.

Compliance Risk

The Company faces significant compliance risk in its business, that is, the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, fines or penalties, financial loss, or damage to reputation resulting from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules, or other regulatory requirements. Among other things, compliance risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. The Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, including SROs. Such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex, and regulatory proceedings and sanctions against financial services firms continue to increase.

The Company attempts to manage compliance risk through policies, procedures and controls reasonably designed to achieve and/or monitor compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, and employment policies. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations.

The nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction, the structure and duration of that transaction, and the parties involved.

The Company’s

exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending

and client option and futures

activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities,

pledged asset lending,

its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and other investing activities. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin

, PAL, option, and futures

requirements for certain securities. Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans,

PALs, option positions,

securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additio

nal collateral in the event

market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received.

Additionally, for margin loan

, PAL

and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned.

Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab.

The Company’s bank loan portfolio includes First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs

and other loans. The

credit risk exposure related to loans is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality

,

including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in

the

determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses.

The Company’s

residential loan

underwriting guidelines include maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan

size

is conforming or jumbo).

The Company does not

originate or purchase

residential

loans that allow for negative amortization and does not purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31,


, approximately


% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

The fair value of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled $

72.3

billion at December 31,


. Of these, $

71.0

billion were issued by U.S. agencies and $

1.3

billion

were issued by private entities (non-agency securities).

These

U.S. agency

and non-agency

securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity.

The fair value of the Company’s investments in asset-backed securities totaled $21.5 billion at December 31, 2015. Schwab holds

$11.4

billion floating rate Federal Family Education Loan Program Asset-Backed Securities (FFELP ABS). Two Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations have placed a portion of FFELP ABS on review for downgrade. Both agencies have indicated that some classes could be downgraded below investment grade due to the risk that some remainder of the securities could be outstanding after their legal final maturity date.

The

timing of

FFELP ABS

principal payments

is inherently

uncertain given the variety of payment options available to student loan borrowers. Loans collateralizing these securities continue to offer a guarantee from the Department of Education of at least 97%. Schwab holds only senior class notes that have additional credit enhancement of 3% or more that, together with the Department of Education guarantee, provide 100%

or more

credit enhancement. The Company has an independent credit assessment function and it does not rely on rating agencies. The Company does not consider these securities to be impaired because it expects full payment of principal and interest. Therefore, the Company continues to assign them the highest internal credit rating.

The

fair value of the

Company’s investments in corporate debt securitie

s and commercial paper totaled $11.1

billion at December 31,


, with th

e majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. T

hese securities are included in securities available for sale, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

Issuer, geographic, and sector concentrations are controlled by established credit policy limits to each concentration type.

The Company’s

bank loans

include

$

7.5

billion of adjustable rate

First Mortgage

loans at December 31,


. The Company’s adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. Approximately


% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately


% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Company’s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates.

The Company’s HELOC product has a 30-year loan term with an initial draw period of

ten

years from the date of origination. After the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20-year amortizing loan. The interest rate during the initial draw period and the 20-year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin.

HELOCs that convert to an amortizing loan may experience higher delinquencies and higher loss rates than those in the initial draw period. The Company’s allowance for loan loss methodology takes this increased inherent risk into consideration.

The following table presents when current outstanding HELOCs will convert to amortizing loans:

The Company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending

,

PAL, and client option and futures activities collateralized by or referencing securities of a single issuer, an index, or within a single industry. This concentration risk is mitigated by collateral arrangements that require the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned.

The Company has indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. The fair value of U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $8.2 billion at December 31, 2015.

Foreign Holdings

The Company has exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial institutions in foreign countries.

The m

ajority of the Company’s foreign investments, at fair value, of $1.5 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.1 billion are in Canada, Australia and France, respectively, at December 31, 2015. These exposures are based on which country the issuer or counterparty is domiciled. The Company has no direct exposure to sovereign foreign governments. The Company does not have unfunded commitments to counterparties in foreign countries, nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of December 31, 2015.

In addition to direct holdings in foreign companies, the Company also has indirect exposure to foreign countries through its investments in Schwab sponsored money market funds (collectively, the Funds) resulting from clearing activities. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $261 million in investments in these Funds. Certain of the Funds’ positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in foreign countries.

Market Risk

Market risk is the potential for changes in

earnings

or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions.

Included in market risk is interest rate risk, which is the risk to earnings or capital arising from movement of interest rates.

For discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk arises from the inability to meet obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses. It is the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument. Limits and contingency funding scenarios have been established for the Company to support liquidity levels and quality during both expected and stressed scenarios. The Company seeks to maintain client confidence in its balance sheet and the safety of client assets by maintaining liquidity and diversity of funding sources to allow the Company to meet its obligations under both expected and stressed scenarios. See “Liquidity” for additional detail on the Company’s liquidity requirements.

LIQUIDITY

CSC’s liquidity needs are primarily driven by the liquidity and capital needs of Schwab Bank and Schwab, the amount of dividend payments on CSC’s common and preferred stock and principal and interest due on corporate debt. The liquidity needs of its brokerage subsidiaries are primarily driven by client activity including trading and margin borrowing activities and capital expenditures; and the liquidity needs of its bank subsidiary are primarily driven by lending and investment activities and client withdrawals of deposits.

The Company has established liquidity policies to support the successful execution of its business strategies, while ensuring ongoing and sufficient liquidity to meet its operational needs and satisfy applicable regulatory requirements under both normal and stress conditions.

The Company employs a variety of methodologies to monitor and manage liquidity. The Company conducts regular liquidity stress testing to develop a consolidated view of liquidity risk exposures and to ensure the Company’s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity during market-related or company-specific liquidity stress events. Liquidity is also tested at key subsidiaries and results are reported on a monthly basis to the Company’s Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify emerging liquidity stresses in the market or within the Company and are reviewed with management as appropriate.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

As of January 1, 2016, the Company is required to comply with the modified LCR rule. This rule was adopted to help regulators ensure that large financial institutions have sufficient liquidity to withstand a short-term stress scenario, and is measured by comparing available high quality liquid assets against prescriptive cash outflows over a 30 day horizon. The Company is

currently

in compliance with the

fully phased-in

modified LCR rule.

Primary Funding Sources

The Company’s primary source of funds is cash generated by client activity: bank deposits and cash balances in brokerage client accounts. In 2015 bank deposits swept from brokerage accounts increased $26.0 billion. These funds were used to invest in interest earning assets, thereby funding a significant portion of the 19% growth in the Company’s balance sheet.

Other sources of funds may include cash flows from operations, maturities and sales of investment securities, repayments on loans, securities lending, and cash provided by external financing or equity offerings.

To meet daily funding needs, the Company maintains liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments. For unanticipated liquidity needs, the Company maintains high-quality liquid assets, currently comprised of U.S. Treasury notes.

Additional Funding Sources

In addition to internal sources of liquidity, the Company has sources of external funding.

CSC maintains a $750 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in June 2016. Other than an overnight borrowing to test the availability of this facility, it was unused during 2015. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes. The financial covenants require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, adjusted to exclude AOCI. At December 31, 2015, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $8.9 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income, at December 31, 2015 was $13.5 billion). Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.

CSC and Schwab also have access to

uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with several banks. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earning investments, and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for six days in 2015, with average daily amounts borrowed of $137 million. These lines were not used by CSC during 2015. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2015.

To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, the broker-dealer subsidiaries have unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with several banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $295 million at December 31, 2015. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2015 or 2014. In connection with its securities lending activities, the Company is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. The collateral requirements were satisfied by providing cash as collateral.

Schwab Bank has access to short-term

secured

funding through the Federal Reserve’s discount window. Amounts available under the Federal Reserve discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale and/or securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral. Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests discount window borrowing procedures on a periodic basis. At December 31, 2015, $2.0 billion was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2015, except for testing purposes.

Schwab Bank

also

maintains a

secured

credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco. Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s residential real estate mortgages and HELOCs that are pledged as collateral. Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests borrowing

procedures on a periodic basis. At December 31, 2015, $9.3 billion was available under this facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2015, except for testing purposes.

CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program not to exceed the amount of the committed

, unsecured credit fa

cility

, which was $750 million at December 31, 2015. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch. There were

no borrowings of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2015 or 2014.

At December 31, 2015 and 2014, CSC had long-term debt of $2.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively, which bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 3.38%.

CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC which enables it to issue debt, equity, and other securities.

On March 10, 2015, CSC issued $625 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that mature in 2018 and $375 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes that mature in 2025. The Senior Notes due 2018 and 2025 have a fixed interest rate of 1.50% and 3.00%, respectively, with interest payable semi-annually. Additionally, on November 13, 2015, CSC issued $350 million aggregate amount of 3.450% Senior Notes that mature in 2026, with interest payable semi-annually.

The following are details of CSC’s long-term debt:

On August 3, 2015, CSC completed an equity offering of 24 million depositary shares, each representing a 1/40

th

ownership interest in a share of 6.00% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock (Series C). The Series C preferred stock has a fixed dividend rate of 6.00%. The net proceeds from the sale were $581 million.

For further discussion of CSC’s long-term debt and information on the equity offering, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Borrowings and 18. Stockholders’ Equity.”

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 6. Bank Loans and Related Allowance for Loan Losses, 14. Borrowings, 15. Commitments and Contingencies, and 16. Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk or Concentration Risk.”

Contractual Obligations

The Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 are shown in the following table. Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).

CAPITAL MANAGEMENT

The Company seeks to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support execution of its business strategy, including anticipated balance sheet growth, providing financial support to its subsidiaries, and sustained access to the capital markets, while at the same time meeting its regulatory capital requirements and serving as a source of financial strength to Schwab Bank. The Company’s primary sources of capital are funds generated by the operations of its subsidiaries and securities issuances by CSC in the capital markets. To ensure that it has a sufficient amount of capital to absorb unanticipated losses or declines in asset values, the Company has adopted a policy to remain well capitalized even in stressed scenarios. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives, and legislative and regulatory developments.

Internal guidelines are set, for both the Company and its regulated subsidiaries, to ensure capital levels are in line with the Company’s strategy and regulatory requirements, and capital forecasts are reviewed monthly at Capital Planning and Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee meetings. A number of early warning indicators are monitored to help identify potential problems that could impact capital and are reviewed with management as appropriate. In addition, the Company monitors its subsidiaries’ capital levels and requirements. Subject to regulatory capital requirements and any required approvals, any excess capital held by subsidiaries is transferred to CSC in the form of dividends and returns. When subsidiaries have need of additional capital, funds are provided by CSC as equity investments and also as subordinated loans (in a form approved as regulatory capital by regulators) for Schwab. The details and method used for each cash infusion are based on an analysis of the particular entity’s needs and financing alternatives. The amounts and structure of infusions must take into consideration maintenance of regulatory capital requirements, debt/equity ratios, and equity double leverage ratios.

The Company conducts regular capital stress testing to assess the potential financial impacts of various plausible adverse macroeconomic and company-specific events to which CSC and its subsidiaries could be subjected. The objective of the Company’s capital stress testing is (1) to explore various potential outcomes

–

including rare and extreme events and (2) to assess impacts of potential stressful outcomes on both capital and liquidity. Additionally, the Company has a comprehensive Capital Contingency Plan to provide action plans for certain low probability/high impact capital events that the Company might face. The Capital Contingency Plan is issued under the authority of the Asset-Liability Management and Pricing

Committee and provides guidelines for sustained capital events. It does not specifically address every contingency, but is designed to provide a framework for responding to any capital stress. The Capital Contingency Plan is reviewed annually and updated as appropriate. See “

Part I – Item 1. – Business –

Regulation” for additional information.

Regulatory Capital Requirements

Beginning on January 1, 2015, CSC became subject to capital requirements set by the Federal Reserve. In addition, CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank and to provide financial assistance if Schwab Bank experiences financial distress. To manage capital adequacy, the Company currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for CSC of at least 6%.

Due to the relatively low risk of the Company’s balance sheet assets and risk-based capital ratios at CSC and Schwab Bank that are well in excess of regulatory requirements, the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio is the most restrictive capital constraint on CSC’s asset growth.

Schwab Bank is also required to maintain capital levels specified by the OCC. These capital requirements are substantially similar to those imposed on CSC by the Federal Reserve. Schwab Bank’s failure to remain well capitalized could result in certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the bank.

The Company currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for Schwab Bank of at least 6.25%. As of January 1, 2015, Schwab Bank became subject to the new Final Regulatory Capital Rules set by the OCC. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2015, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized.

The following table details CSC’s and Schwab Bank’s capital ratios under the new Final Regulatory Capital Rules:

(1)

CSC and Schwab Bank have elected to opt-out of the requirement to include most components of AOCI in CET1 Capital.

The Company’s broker-dealer subsidiaries (Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc.) are subject to regulatory requirements of the Uniform Net Capital Rule. The rule is intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit the broker-dealer subsidiaries from paying cash dividends, making unsecured advances and loans to their parent company and employees, and Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. As such, the broker-dealer subsidiaries are required to maintain, at all times, at least the minimum level of net capital required under Rule 15c3-1. At December 31, 2015, Schwab and optionsXpress met and exceeded their net capital requirements.

See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Consolidated Balance Sheets and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 23. Regulatory Requirements” for additional information on the components of stockholder’s equity and information on the capital requirements of each of the subsidiaries.

In addition to capital requirements, the Company’s subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure financial soundness and liquidity.

Schwab Bank is subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions. In addition, Schwab Bank is required to provide notice to, and may be required to obtain approval from, the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC.

Dividends

CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $318 million ($0.24 per share) and $316 million ($0.24 per share) in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 107 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend rate 19 times, resulting in a 20% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, CSC currently targets its common stock cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.

CSC paid Series A Preferred Stock cash dividends of $28 million ($70.00 per share) in 2015 and 2014, respectively. CSC paid Series B Preferred Stock cash dividends of $29 million ($60.00 per share) in 2015 and 2014, respectively. CSC

paid

Series C cash dividends of $12

million ($19.67 per share) in 2015.

Share Repurchases

There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2015 or 2014. As of December 31, 2015, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock, which is not subject to expiration.

FAIR

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company uses

the market and income approaches to determine the

fair value

of

certain financial assets and liabilities

recorded

at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and

17.

Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities” for more information on the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.

When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data with a bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. The Company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value. The Company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. The Company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. The Company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31,

2015 and 2014

, the Company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates

, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the C

ompany’s financial position and

reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below

.

Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.

Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity

Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other-

than-temporarily impaired

on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such security

before

any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the then-current fair value.

A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance,

t

he impairment recognized in earnings

represents

the

estimated credit loss, and

is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security.

Management

utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. Expected cash flows are discounted using the secu

rity’s effective interest rate.

The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental.

The evaluation includes the consideration of multiple factors including: the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss; the financial condition of the issuer; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; for asset-backed securities, the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral; recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer’s industry; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments.

Valuation of Goodwill

The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is April 1

st

. In testing for a potential impairment of

goodwill on April 1,


,

management performed an assessment of each

of the Company’s reporting units

(generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and concluded that goodwill was

not

impaired.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio

s

.

The methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses

related to the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios

utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments. The methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index,

economic

conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, LTV ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk measured by FICO scores, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan products, year of origination,

and

geographical distribution of collateral.

Probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and

LIBOR rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Further, the delinquency roll rates within the loan-level simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios. Loss severity estimates are based on the Company’s historical loss experience and market trends. The estimated loss severity (i.e.

,

loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss for HELOCs is higher than that used for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values.

Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations.

Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. This methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances

to determine the allowance for l

oan loss for each loan segment.

Legal and Regulatory Reserves

Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved.

The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the potential for changes in

earnings

or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equi

ty prices or market conditions.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets.

The majority of the Company’s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities are sensitive to changes in short-term interest rates.

To a lesser degree, the Company is sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates through some of its investment portfolios.

To manage the Company’s market risk related to interest rates, management utilizes simulation models, which include the net interest revenue sensitivity analysis described below.

Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may reprice at different times or by different amounts, and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets

primarily

include

investment securities, margin loans and bank loans.

These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and changes

in

prepayment levels

that

tend to increase in a declining rate environment

and decrease in a rising rate environment

.

Because the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and

bank

deposits and the rates charged on margin loans and

bank

loans, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.

To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures

which

include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios.

The Company is also subject to market risk as a result of fluctuations in

option and

equity prices. The Company’s direct holdings of

option and

equity securities and its associated exposure to

option and

equity prices are not material. The Company is indirectly exposed to

option, futures, and

equity market fluctuations in connection with

client option and futures accounts,

securities collateralizing ma

rgin loans to brokerage client

s, and c

lient

securities loaned out as part of the Company’s securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin borrowing, and overall client engagement with the Company. Additionally, the Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company.

Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is, the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a financial instrument.

Current

conditions in the credit markets have reduced market liquidity

among a

range of financial instruments, including

the types of

instruments held by the Company, and fair value can differ significantly from the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows.

The Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material.

Net Interest Revenue Simulation

For the Company’s net interest revenue sensitivity analysis, the

Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the

simulation

include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and product pricing assumptions. The Company uses constant balances and market rates in the

simulation

assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to balance growth or decline and the timing,

-


-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix.

If the Company’s guidelines for its net interest revenue sensitivity are breached, management must report the breach to the Company’s Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee and establish a plan to address the interest rate risk. This plan could include, but is not limited to, rebalancing certain investment portfolios or using derivative instruments to mitigate the interest rate risk. Depending on the severity and expected duration of the breach, as well as the then current interest rate environment, the plan could also be to take no action. Any plan that recommends taking action is required to be approved by the Company’s Corporate

Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee

. There were

no

breaches of the Company’s net interest revenue sensitivity guidelines during

the years ended December 31, 2015 or 2014

.

As represented by the simulations presented below, the Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall.

T

he simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the

simulated net interest revenue change over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2015 and 2014 of a

gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market

interest rates relative to prevailing market rates at the end of each reporting period.

The sensitivities shown in the simulation reflect the fact that short-term interest rates in


remained at low levels

despite the increase in federal funds target range to .25% to .50% as directed by the Federal Open Markets Committee in December 2015.

The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than any offsetting reduction in interest expense, further compressing net interest margin. Any increases in short-term interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding sources.

Introduction and Basis of Presentation

CSC is a savings and loan holding company engaged, through its subsidiaries, in

wealth management,

securities brokerage, banking, money management,

custody,

and financial advisory services. Schwab is a securities broker-dealer with over


domestic branch offices in


states, as well as a branch in each of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and London, England. In addition, Schwab serves clients in Hong Kong through one of CSC’s subsidiaries. Other subsidiaries include Schwab Bank, a federal savings bank, and CSIM, the investment advisor for Schwab’s proprietary mutual funds, which are referred to as the Schwab Funds

®

, and for Schwab’s exchange-traded funds, which are referred to as the Schwab ETFs

™

.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include CSC and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Company). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying financial statements. Certain estimates relate to

OTTI

of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity, valuation of goodwill, allowance for loan losses, and legal and regulatory reserves. Actual results may differ from those estimates.

Principles of Consolidation

The Company accounts for investments in entities for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. Investments in entities for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are generally carried at cost. Both equity method and cost method investments are included in other assets.

The Company evaluates its initial and continuing involvement with certain entities to determine if the Company is required to consolidate the entities under the variable interest entity (VIE) model. For interests in entities other than the Company’s sponsored funds, the evaluation is based on a qualitative assessment of whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The primary beneficiary of a VIE has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the

VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that potentially could be significant to the VIE.

The primary beneficiary determination for the Company’s sponsored funds is based on a quantitative assessment of whether the Company would absorb a majority of the VIE’s expected losses, receive a majority of the VIE’s expected residual returns, or both. Based upon the Company’s assessments, the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of and, therefore, is not required to consolidate any VIEs.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Asset management and administration fees

Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients, and are recognized as revenue over the period that the related service is provided, based upon average asset balances. The Company’s policy is to recognize revenue subject to refunds because management can estimate refunds based on Company specific experience. Actual refunds were not material as of December 31, 2015. The Company earns mutual fund

and ETF

service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions, which include advisory and managed account services that are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds

and ETFs

are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees, such as third-party mutual fund service fees, trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, and mutual fund clearing and other service fees.

In 2015, 2014 and 2013,

the Company waived a portion of its asset management fees earned from certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds. Under agreements with these funds entered into when the Company began waiving fees, the

-


-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

Company was entitled to recover such fee waivers depending on the future performance of the funds and approval by the boards of the respective funds until the third anniversary of the end of the fiscal year in which such fee waiver occurs, subject to certain limitations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company terminated the fee waiver reimbursement agreements and, therefore, no longer has the right to receive reimbursement of waived fees.

Interest revenue

Interest revenue represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents, cash and investments segregated, receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations, receivables from brokerage clients, other securities owned, securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, and bank loans. Interest revenue is recognized in the period earned based upon average or daily asset balances and respective interest rates.

Trading revenue

Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in client fixed income securities.

Factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of client trades and market price volatility.

To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, the Company maintains positions in fixed income securities, including U.S. state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government, corporate debt and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes adjustments to the fair value of these securities positions.

Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are not segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds, deposits with banks, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities. Cash and cash equivalents also include balances that Schwab Bank maintains at the Federal Reserve Bank.

Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes

Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes

include securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements), which are collateralized by U.S. Government and agency securities.

Resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions that are recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued interest. The Company obtains control of collateral with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned and accrued interest under resale agreements. Collateral is valued daily by the Company, with additional collateral obtained to ensure full collateralization. Cash and investments segregated also include

certificates of deposit and U.S. Government securities. Certificates of deposit and U.S. Government securities are recorded at fair value. Pursuant to applicable regulations, client cash balances not used for margin lending are segregated into investment accounts maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients.

Receivables from brokerage clients

Receivables from brokerage clients include margin loans to clients and are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables from brokerage clients that remain unsecured or partially secured for more than 30 days are fully reserved.

Other securities owned

Other securities owned are recorded at fair value based on quoted market prices or other observable market data. Unrealized gains and losses are included in trading revenue.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

Securities available for sale and securities held to maturity

Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in stockholders’ equity. Securities held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost based on the Company’s positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Realized gains and losses from sales of securities available for sale are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in other revenue.

Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are OTTI on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such security before any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value.

A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover all of the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, the impairment recognized in earnings represents the estimated credit loss, and is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Where appropriate, management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities to estimate the credit loss. Expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate

.

The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental.

The evaluation includes the consideration of multiple factors including: the magnitude and duration of the unrealized loss; the financial condition of the issuer; the payment structure of the security; external credit ratings; for asset-backed securities, the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security to absorb credit losses on the underlying collateral; recent events specific to the issuer and the issuer’s industry; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments.

Securities borrowed and securities loaned

Securities borrowed require the Company to deliver cash to the lender in exchange for securities and are included in receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. For securities loaned, the Company receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of securities loaned. Securities loaned are included in payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned, with additional collateral obtained or refunded to ensure full collateralization.

Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest expense.

Bank loans and related allowance for loan losses

Bank loans

are recorded at their contractual principal amounts and include unamortized direct origination costs or net purchase discounts or premiums. Direct origination costs and premiums and discounts are recognized in interest revenue using the effective interest method over the contractual life of the loan and are adjusted for actual prepayments. Additionally, loans are recorded net of an allowance for loan losses. The Company’s loan portfolio includes four loan segments: First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs and other loans. First Mortgages include two loan classes: first mortgages and purchased first mortgages. Loan segments are defined as the level to which the Company disaggregates its loan portfolio when developing and documenting a methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses. A loan class is defined as a group of loans within a loan segment that has homogeneous risk characteristics.

PALs are collateralized by marketable securities with liquid markets. Credit lines are over-collateralized dependent on the type of security pledged. Collateral market value is monitored on a daily basis and a borrower’s committed line may be reduced or collateral may be liquidated if the collateral is in danger of falling below specified levels. As such, the loss inherent within this portfolio is limited.

The Company records an allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings

based on management’s estimate of probable losses in the existing portfolio. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses quarterly, taking into consideration current

-


-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

economic conditions, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level

.

The methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments. The methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index, economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, LTV ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk measured by FICO scores, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments, including loan products, year of origination, and geographical distribution of collateral.

Probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and LIBOR rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Further, the delinquency roll rates within the loan-level simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios. Loss severity estimates are based on the Company’s historical loss experience and market trends. The estimated loss severity (i.e., loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for HELOC loans is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths.

This methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment.

The Company considers loan modifications in which it makes an economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to be a troubled debt restructuring (TDR).

Nonaccrual, Nonperforming and Impaired loans

First Mortgages, HELOCs, PALs, and other loans are placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming

90 days past due as to interest or principal (unless the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection), or when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain, including loans to borrowers who have filed for bankruptcy. For the portion of the HELOC portfolio for which the Company is able to track the delinquency status on the associated first lien loan, the Company places a HELOC on non-accrual status if the associated first mortgage is 90 days or more delinquent, regardless of the payment status of the HELOC. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method until qualifying for return to accrual status. Generally, a nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal is repaid and the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance, or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful. Loans on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned are considered nonperforming assets. Nonaccrual loans, other real estate owned and TDRs are considered impaired assets as it is probable the Company will not collect all amounts due.

Loan Charge-Offs

The Company charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for loan losses and the loan balance. The Company’s charge-off policy for First Mortgage and HELOC loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or has been discharged in bankruptcy proceedings,

-


-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated costs to sell.

Equipment, office facilities, and property

Equipment, office facilities, and property are recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, except for land, which is recorded at cost. Equipment and office facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of five to ten years. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 20 to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Software and certain costs incurred for purchasing or developing software for internal use are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three or five years. Equipment, office facilities, and property are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the fair value of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value of the individually identified net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever indications of impairment exist. The Company’s annual impairment testing date is April 1

st

. The Company can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. A qualitative assessment considers macroeconomic and other industry-specific factors, such as trends in short-term and long-term interest rates and the ability to access capital, and Company specific factors such as market capitalization in excess of net assets, trends in revenue generating activities, and merger or acquisition activity.

If the Company elects to bypass qualitatively assessing goodwill, or it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, management estimates the fair values of each of the Company’s reporting units (defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compares it to their carrying values. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are established using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit, a market approach which compares each reporting unit to comparable companies in their respective industries, as well as a market capitalization analysis. Based on the Company’s analysis, fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units as of its annual testing date.

Intangible assets

Intangible

assets are amortized over their useful lives in a manner that best reflects their economic benefit. Intangible assets are

reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company does not have any indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Investments

As part of the Company’s community reinvestment initiatives, the Company invests with other institutional investors in funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties. The Company receives tax credits and other tax benefits for these investments. The Company accounts for investments in qualified affordable housing projects using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. The proportional amortization method amortizes the cost of the investment over the period in which the investor expects to receive tax credits and other tax benefits, and the resulting amortization is recognized as a component of income tax expense attributable to continuing operations. The carrying value of LIHTC investments is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet

s

. Unfunded commitments related to LIHTC investments are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

Guarantees and indemnifications

The Company recognizes, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair values of obligations relating to guarantees are estimated based on transactions for similar guarantees or expected present value measures.

Advertising and market development

Advertising and market development activities include the cost to produce and distribute marketing campaigns as well as client incentives and discounts. Such costs are generally expensed when incurred.

Income taxes

The Company provides for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are adjusted to reflect the tax rates at which future taxable amounts will likely be settled or realized. The effects of tax rate changes on future deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as well as other changes in income tax laws, are recorded in earnings in the period during which such changes are enacted. The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities, represent the difference between positions taken on tax return filings and estimated potential tax settlement outcomes. Accrued interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits is recorded in income tax expense and penalties are recorded in other expense.

Stock-based compensation

Stock-based compensation includes employee and board of director stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards. The Company measures compensation expense for these share-based payment arrangements based on their estimated fair values as of the awards’ grant date. The fair value of the share-based award is recognized over the vesting period as stock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation expense is based on awards expected to vest and therefore is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on the Company’s historical forfeiture experience and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards are recorded in additional paid-in capital.

Fair values of assets and liabilities

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement accounting guidance describes the fair value hierarchy for

disclosing assets and liabilities measured at

fair value

based on the inputs used to value them. The fair value hierarchy

maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are based on market pricing data obtained from sources independent of the Company.

A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is generally used to measure fair value whenever available.

Unobservable inputs reflect management’s judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.

Where inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or liability are from different levels of the hierarchy, the asset or liability is categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment.

The fair value hierarchy includes three levels based on the objectivity of the inputs as follows:

·

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets as of the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access.

·

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates, benchmark yields, issuer spreads, new issue data, and collateral performance.

-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

·

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability.

The Company’s policy is to recognize transfers of financial instruments between levels as of the beginning of the reporting period in which a transfer occurs.

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis

The Company’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis include certain cash equivalents, certain investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, other securities owned, and securities available for sale. The Company uses the market and income approaches to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. The Company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value.

The Company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. The Company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. The Company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts.

Fair value of other financial instruments

Descriptions of the valuation methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of other financial instruments are described below. The Company’s financial instruments not recorded at fair value but for which fair value can be approximated and disclosed include:

·

Cash and cash equivalents

are short-term in nature and accordingly are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value.

·

Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes

include cash and securities purchased under resale agreements. Securities purchased under resale agreements are short-term in nature and are backed by collateral that both exceeds the carrying value of the resale agreement and is highly liquid in nature. Accordingly, the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values.

·

Receivables from/payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations

are recorded at contractual amounts and historically have been settled at those values and are short-term in nature, and therefore the carrying values of these financial instruments approximate their fair values.

·

Securities held to maturity

– The fair values of securities held to maturity are obtained using an independent third-party pricing service similar to investment assets recorded at fair value as discussed above.

·

Bank loans

– The fair values of the Company’s First Mortgages and HELOCs are estimated based on prices of mortgage-backed securities collateralized by similar types of loans. PALs are non-purpose revolving lines of credit secured by eligible assets; accordingly, the carrying values of these loans approximate their fair values.

·

Financial instruments included in other assets

primarily consist of LIHTC investments, cost method investments and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock, whose carrying values approximate their fair values. FHLB stock is recorded at par, which approximates fair value.

·

Bank deposits

have no stated maturity and are recorded at the amount payable on demand as of the balance sheet date. The Company considers the carrying value of these deposits to approximate their fair values.

·

Financial instruments included in accrued expenses and other liabilities

consist of commercial paper, drafts payable, unfunded LIHTC commitments and certain amounts due under contractual obligations which are short-term in nature and accordingly are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value.

·

Long-term debt

– Except for the finance lease obligation, the fair values of long-term debt are estimated using indicative, non-binding quotes from independent brokers. The Company validates indicative prices for its debt through comparison to other independent non-binding quotes. The finance lease obligation is recorded at carrying value, which approximates fair value.

·

Firm commitments to extend credit

– The Company extends credit to banking clients through HELOCs and PALs. The Company considers the fair value of these unused commitments to not be material because the interest rates earned on these balances are based on floating interest rates that reset monthly.

New Accounting Standards

Adoption of New Accounting Standards

In January 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-04, “Receivables – Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors (Subtopic 310-40).” ASU 2014-04 provides new guidance for creditors of consumer mortgage loans, and was effective January 1, 2015. The guidance clarifies when physical possession of a property underlying a consumer mortgage loan transfers to the creditor, and therefore when a loan receivable should be derecognized and the real estate property underlying the loan should be recognized. The adoption of this new guidance in the first quarter of 2015 did not have an impact on the Company’s financial statements or EPS as the Company’s practice for recognizing foreclosed real estate was already consistent with the guidance.

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15, “Interest – Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30).” Pursuant to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Announcement at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force meeting, ASU 2015-15 provides clarification to ASU 2015-03 (discussed below) of SEC Staff views on the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. The new guidance permits deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of a line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line of credit. The adoption of this new guidance in the third quarter of 2015 did not have an impact on the Company’s financial statements or EPS as the Company’s practice for recognizing debt issuance costs on line-of-credit arrangements was already consistent with the guidance.

New Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),” which provides new guidance on revenue recognition. The guidance clarifies that revenue from contracts with customers should be recognized in a manner that depicts the timing of the related transfer of goods or performance of services at an amount that reflects the expected consideration. The new guidance will become effective January 1, 2018, and permits entities to elect either full or modified retrospective transition. Full retrospective transition will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the earliest comparative period presented. Modified retrospective transition will require a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the reporting period in which the entity first applies the new guidance. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its financial statements and EPS.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, “Consolidation (Topic 810),” which amends the analysis a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. The new guidance became effective

-


-

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

January 1, 2016, and is applicable to all entities but provides an exception for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds.

The adoption of ASU 2015-02 will not have an impact on the Company

’

s consolidated financial statements or EPS as of

December 31, 2015.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, “Interest – Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30).” The new guidance will require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Currently, debt issuance costs are presented as a separate asset. The new guidance, which became effective January 1, 2016, will not impact the Company’s financial results or EPS as the change only affects the balance sheet presentation of debt issuance costs; recognition and measurement of debt issuance costs will not be affected.

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40),” which provides new guidance that clarifies customer’s accounting for fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement. Under the new guidance, if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer shall account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If the cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer shall account for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance became effective January 1, 2016, and applies to any new arrangements entered into after that date. The Company does not expect the new guidance will have a significant impact on its financial statements or EPS.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, “Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10),” which will become effective January 1, 2018. This new guidance addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its financial statements and EPS.

Variable Interest Entities

A VIE requires consolidation by the entity’s primary beneficiary. The Company evaluates all of the entities in which it is involved to determine if an entity is a VIE and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary. See the “Principles of Consoli

dation” section of “Notes – 1.

Introduction and Basis of Presentation” for discussion of the Company’s evaluations of VIEs and whether it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of any VIEs in which it holds an interest. The Company was not the primary beneficiary of, and therefore, not required to consolidate any VIEs during 2015, 2014, or 2013.

Community Reinvestment Act investments

Schwab Bank is subject to

the

CRA. The CRA is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of the communities in which they operate, including low and moderate income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking operations. As part of Schwab Bank’s community reinvestment initiatives, Schwab Bank invests with other institutional investors in funds that make equity investments in multifamily affordable housing properties.

In 2014, Schwab Bank’s management approved a program to invest in LIHTC funds. Schwab Bank receives tax credits and other tax benefits for these investments. Schwab Bank’s LIHTC investments are accounted for using the proportional amortization method if certain criteria are met. See

“Notes – 2.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”

for discussion of the application of the proportional amortization method

. As of December

31, 2015, the majority of the Company’s VIEs are related to Schwab Bank’s LIHTC investments made in 2014 and 2015. Schwab Bank did not have any LIHTC investments prior to 2014. Schwab Bank also has investments in other CRA-related funds, which were invested prior to 2014.

During 2015 and 2014, Schwab Bank recorded amortization of

$3.3

million and

$0.3

million, respectively, and recognized tax credits

and other tax benefits

of

$4.5

million and

$0.5

million, r

espectively, associated with these investments, both of which are included in taxes on income. The carrying value of the LIHTC investments was

$104

million and

$45

million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which is included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet

s

. Schwab Bank recorded liabilities of

$84

million and

$40

million for unfunded commitments related to LIHTC investments at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet

s

. Schwab Bank’s funding of these remaining commitments is dependent upon the occurrence of certain conditions

and Schwab Bank expects to pay substantially all of these commitments between 2016 and 2020.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

The Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company’s liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the cash and securities it has posted as collateral. However, the potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees.

Legal contingencies:

The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.

The Company believes it has strong defenses in all significant matters currently pending and is contesting liability and any damages claimed. Nevertheless, some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards, including penalties, injunctions or other relief, and the Company may also determine to settle a matter because of the uncertainty and risks of litigation.

Described below are certain matters in which there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss could be incurred or where the matter may otherwise be of significant interest to stockholders.

Unless otherwise noted, the Company is unable to provide a reasonable estimate of any potential liability given the stage of proceedings in the matter.

With respect to all other pending matters, based

on current information and consultation with counsel, it does not appear

reasonably possible

that the outcome of any such matter

would

be material to the financial condition, operating results or cash flows of the Company. However, predicting the outcome of a litigation or regulatory matter is inherently difficult, requiring significant judgment and evaluation of various factors, including the procedural status of the matter and any recent developments; prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases; available defenses, including potential opportunities to dispose of a case on the merits or procedural grounds before trial (e.g., motions to dismiss or for summary judgment); the progress of fact discovery; the opinions of counsel and experts regarding potential damages; potential opportunities for settlement and the status of any settlement discussions; and potential insurance coverage and indemnification.

It may

not

be

possible to reasonably estimate potential liability, if any, or a range of potential liability until the matter is closer to resolution

–

pending, for example, further proceedings, the outcome of key motions or appeals, or discussions among the parties.

Numerous issues may have to be developed, such as discovery of important factual matters and determination of threshold legal issues, which may include novel or unsettled questions of law. Reserves are established or adjusted or further disclosure and estimates of potential loss are provided as the matter progresses and more information becomes available.

Total Bond Market Fund Litigation

: On August 28, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of investors in the Schwab Total Bond Market Fund™. The lawsuit, which alleges violations of state law and federal securities law in connection with the

fund’s investment policy, named CSIM,

Schwab Investments (registrant and issue

r of the fund’s shares) and certain current and former fund trustees

as defendants. Allegations include that the fund improperly deviated from its stated investment objectives by investing in collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and investing more than

25%

of fund assets in CMOs and mortgage-backed securities without obtainin

g a shareholder vote. Plaintiff

seek

s

unspecified compensatory and rescission damages, unspecified equitable and injunctive relief, costs

and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiff’s

federal securities law

claim and certain of plaintiff’s

state law claims were dismissed

.

On August 8, 2011,

the court dismissed plaintiff’s

remaining c

laims with prejudice. Plaintiff

appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which issued a ruling on March 9, 2015 reversing the district court’s dismissal of the case and remanding the case for further proceedings. A petition by defendants for U.S. Supreme Court review was denied on October 6, 2015. In the interim, defendants filed a fourth amended complaint on June 25, 2015. Defendants moved to dismiss and on October 6, 2015, the court dismissed with prejudice plaintiff’s contractual claims, but declined to dismiss certain of the claims for fiduciary breach. On February 23, 2016, the court dismissed plaintiff’s remaining claims with prejudice. Plaintiff has 30 days in which to appeal.

Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk or Concentration Risk

Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk

Resale and repurchase agreements:

Schwab enters into collateralized resale agreements principally with other broker-dealers, which could result in losses in the event the counterparty fails to purchase the securities held as collateral for the cash advanced and the fair value of the securities declines. To mitigate this risk, Schwab requires that the counterparty deliver securities to a custodian, to be held as collateral, with a fair value in excess of the resale price. Schwab also sets standards for the credit quality of the counterparty, monitors the fair value of the underlying securities as compared to the related receivable, including accrued interest, and requires additional collateral where deemed appropriate. At December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value of collateral received in connection with resale agreements that are available to be repledged or sold was

$

8.2

billion and

$10.4

billion, respectively. Schwab utilizes the collateral provided under these resale agreements to meet obligations under broker-dealer client protection rules, which place limitations on its ability to access such segregated securities. For Schwab to repledge or sell this collateral, it would be required to deposit cash and/or securities of an equal amount into its segregated reserve bank accounts in order to meet its segregated cash and investment requirement. The Company’s resale agreements are not subject to master netting arrangements.

Securities lending:

The Company loans client securities temporarily to other brokers in connection with its securities lending activities and receives cash as collateral for the securities loaned. Increases in security prices may cause the fair value of the securities loaned to exceed the amount of cash received as collateral. In the event the counterparty to these transactions does not return the loaned securities or provide additional cash collateral, the Company may be exposed to the risk of acquiring the securities at prevailing market prices in order to satisfy its client obligations. The Company mitigates this risk by requiring credit approvals for counterparties, monitoring the fair value of securities loaned, and requiring additional cash as collateral when necessary. The fair value of client securities pledged in securities lending transactions to other broker-dealers was

$1.9

billion and

$1.3

billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company has also pledged a portion of its securities owned in connection with securities lending transactions to other broker-dealers. Additionally, the Company borrows securities from other broker-dealers to fulfill short sales by clients and delivers cash to the lender in exchange for the securities. The fair value of these borrowed securities was

$72

million and

$88

million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. All of the Company’s securities lending transactions are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements with other broker-dealers. However, the Company does not net securities lending transactions and therefore, the Company’s securities loaned and securities borrowed are presented gross in the consolidated balance sheets.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

The following table presents information about the Company’s resale agreements and securities lending activity to enable the users of the Company’s financial statements to evaluate the potential effect of rights of setoff between these recognized assets and recognized liabilities.

Client trade settlement:

The Company is obligated to settle transactions with brokers and other financial institutions even if the Company’s clients fail to meet their obligations to the Company. Clients are required to complete their transactions on settlement date, generally three business days after the trade date. If clients do not fulfill their contractual obligations, the Company may incur losses. The Company has established procedures to reduce this risk by requiring deposits from clients in excess of amounts prescribed by regulatory requirements for certain types of trades,

and therefore the potential to make payments under these client transactions is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these transactions

.

Margin lending:

The Company provides margin loans to its clients which are collateralized by securities in their brokerage accounts and may be liable for the margin requirement of its client margin securities transactions. As clients write options or sell securities short, the Company may incur losses if the clients do not fulfill their obligations and the collateral in client accounts is insufficient to fully cover losses which clients may incur from these strategies. To mitigate this risk, the Company monitors required margin levels and requires clients to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions to meet minimum collateral requirements. The contractual value of margin loans to clients was

$

15.8

billion and

$14.3

billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Clients with margin loans have agreed to allow the Company to pledge collateralized securities in their brokerage accounts in accordance with federal regulations. Under such regulations, the Company was allowed to pledge securities with a fair value of

$

22.4

billion and

$20.4

billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The fair value of client securities pledged to fulfill the short sales of its clients was

$

1.3

billion and

$1.5

billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The fair

value of client securities pledged to fulfill the Company’s proprietary short sales, which resulted from facilitating clients’ dividend reinvestment elections, was

$303

million and

$216

million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company may also pledge client securities to fulfill client margin requirements for open option contracts established with the Options Clearing Corporation. The fair value of these pledged securities to the Options Clearing Corporation was

$1.5

billion and

$1.3

billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Financial Guarantees:

See “Notes – 15. Commitments and Contingencies.”

Concentration Risk

The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions of financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry.

The fair value of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled

$72.3

billion at December 31, 2015. Of these,

$71.0

billion were issued by U.S. agencies and

$1.3

billion were issued by private entities (non-agency securities). The fair value of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled

$53.8

billion at December 31, 2014. Of these,

$52.5

billion were issued by U.S. agencies and

$1.3

billion were non-agency securities. These U.S. agency and non-agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity

in the consolidated balance sheets

.

The fair value of the Company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled

$

11.1

billion and

$8.1

billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry.

These securities are included in securities available for sale, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned.

The Company’s bank loans include

$

7.5

billion and

$7.4

billion of

adjustable rate

First Mortgages at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. At December 31, 2015, approximately

39%

of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. At December 31, 2015, the interest rates on approximately

53%

of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for

three

or more years. For additional detail on concentrations in bank loans, see “Notes – 6. Bank Loans and Related Allowance for Loan Losses.”

No single client accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net revenues in 2015, 2014, or 2013. Substantially all of the Company’s revenues and assets are generated or located in the U.S. The percentage of Schwab’s total client accounts located in California was

23%

at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013.

The Company also has exposure to concentration risk from its

margin and securities

lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. This concentration risk is mitigated by collateral arrangements that require the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned, as described above.

17.

Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities

For a description of the fair value hierarchy and the Company’s fair value methodologies, including the use of independent third-party pricing services, see “Notes – 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company did not transfer any assets or liabilities between Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 during 2015 or 2014. In addition, the Company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service at December 31, 2015 or 2014.

Employee Incentive, Retirement, and Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company’s stock incentive plans provide for granting options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards to employees, officers, and directors. In addition, the Company offers retirement and employee stock purchase plans to eligible employees and sponsors deferred compensation plans for eligible officers and non-employee directors.

A summary of the Company’s stock-based compensation and related income tax benefit is as follows:

The Company issues shares for stock options and restricted stock awards from treasury stock. At December 31, 2015, the Company was authorized to grant up to


million common shares under its existing stock incentive plans. Additionally, at December 31, 2015, the Company had


million shares reserved for future issuance under its employee stock purchase plan.

As of December 31, 2015, there was

$201

million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized through 201


with a remaining weighted-average service period of

2.8

years.

Stock Option Plan

Options are granted for the purchase of shares of common stock at an exercise price not less than market value on the date of grant, and expire within

seven

The Company’s stock option activity is summarized below:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above represents the difference between CSC’s closing stock price and the exercise price of each in-the-money option on the last trading day of the period presented.

Information on stock options granted and exercised is presented below:

Management uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The binomial model takes into account the contractual term of the stock option, expected volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of publicly-traded options on CSC’s stock. Dividend yield is based on the average historical CSC dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term similar to the contractual term of the option. Management uses historical option exercise data, which includes employee termination data to estimate the probability of future option exercises. Management uses the Black-Scholes model to solve for the expected life of options valued with the binomial model presented below. The assumptions used to value the Company’s options granted during the years presented and their expected lives were as follows:

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units are awards that entitle the holder to receive shares of CSC’s common stock following a vesting period. Restricted stock units are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest annually over a

three

- to

five

-year period, while some vest based upon the Company achieving certain financial or other measures. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The fair value of the restricted stock units that vested during each of the years 2015, 2014, and 2013 was

$126

million,

$116

million, and

$78

million, respectively.

Earnings Per Common Share

EPS is computed using the two-class method. Preferred stock dividends, and undistributed earnings and dividends allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in determining net income available to common stockholders.

Basic EPS is

calculated

by dividing net

income available

to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Dilutive potential common shares include

Regulatory Requirements

CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution subsidiary, is a federal savings bank.

CSC is subject to examination, supervision, and regulation by the Federal Reserve. Schwab Bank is subject to examination, supervision, and regulation by the OCC, as its primary regulator, the FDIC as its deposit insurer, and the CFPB, as its conduct regulator.

CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank. On January 1, 2015, CSC became subject to regulatory capital requirements adopted by the Federal Reserve.

Schwab Bank is subject to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws, including regulatory capital requirements and requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions, such as extensions of credit to, or asset purchases from CSC or its other subsidiaries by Schwab Bank. In addition, Schwab Bank is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. The federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver.

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, Schwab Bank could be subject to restrictive actions if it were to fall within one of the lowest three of five capital categories. CSC and

Schwab Bank are required to maintain minimum capital levels as specified in federal banking regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on CSC and Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2015, both CSC and Schwab Bank met all of their respective capital requirements. Certain events, such as growth in bank deposits and regulatory discretion, could adversely affect CSC’s or Schwab Bank’s ability to meet future capital requirements.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

The regulatory capital and ratios for CSC and Schwab Bank are as follows:

(1)

The ratios above reflect the impact of a change in approach related to the risk-weighting of the majority of the Company’s margin loan portfolio in accordance with the new capital requirements based on Basel III rules which became effective at the beginning of 2015.

(2)

Due to the change in regulatory requirements, the December 31, 2015 ratios were calculated under the new capital requirements based on Basel III requirements and the December 31, 2014 ratios were calculated under the prior capital requirements based on Basel I requirements.

N/A Not applicable.

Based on their regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2015, CSC and Schwab Bank are considered well capitalized (the highest category) under their respective regulatory capital rules. Schwab Bank was also considered well capitalized at December 31, 2014 under the previous regulatory capital rules then in effect. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2015, that management believes have changed Schwab Bank’s capital category.

The Federal Reserve requires Schwab Bank to maintain reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Bank based on its deposits that are considered to be transaction accounts. Schwab Bank’s average reserve requirements were $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively.

CSC’s principal broker-dealers are Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc.

Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. are both subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule). Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. compute net capital under the alternative method permitted by the Uniform Net Capital Rule. This method requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement ($250,000), which is based on the type of business conducted by the broker-dealer. Under the alternative method, a broker-dealer may not repay subordinated borrowings, pay cash dividends, or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.

optionsXpress, Inc. is also subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17 (Reg. 1.17) under the Commodity Exchange Act, which also requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. optionsXpress, Inc., as a futures commission merchant, is required to maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of its net capital requirement under Reg. 1.17 ($1 million), or the sum of 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in client accounts and 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in non-client accounts (as defined in Reg. 1.17).

Segment Information

The Company’s

two

reportable segments are Investor Services and Advisor Services. The Company structures its operating segments according to its clients and the services provided to those clients. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services

,

retirement plan services, and

other

corporate brokerage services. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services

as well as

retirement business services. Revenues and expenses are allocated to the Company’s two segments based on which segment services the client.

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in

“N

ote

s – 2.

Summary of Signif

icant Accounting Policies.”

For the computation of its segment information, the Company utilizes an activity-based costing model to allocate traditional income statement line item expenses (e.g., compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and professional services) to the business activities driving segment expenses (e.g., client service, opening new accounts, or business development) and a funds transfer pricing methodology to allocate certain revenues.

The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax b

asis, excluding

significant non-recurring items and results of discontinued operations. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. However, capital expenditures are used in resource allocation and are therefore disclosed. There are no revenues from transactions between the segments. Capital expenditures are reported gross, and are not net of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNING FIRM

To the

Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Charles Schwab Corporation

San Francisco, California

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Charles Schwab Corporation and subsidiaries (the

“

Company

”

) as of December 31,

2015 and 2014

, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,


. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of the Company on page F-2. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,


, based on

the

criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on

the

financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists,

and

testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Charles Schwab Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31,

2015 and 2014

, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,


, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,


, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

(2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
