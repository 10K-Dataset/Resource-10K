                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION


                                     PART I


Item 1. Business

(a)  General Development of Business

     The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC, and with its subsidiaries collectively
referred to as the Company) was  incorporated  in 1986 and engages,  through its
subsidiaries,  in securities brokerage, banking, and related financial services.
Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (Schwab) was incorporated in 1971 and is a securities
broker-dealer that entered the discount  brokerage business in 1974.  U.S. Trust
Corporation  (USTC,  and  with  its  subsidiaries  collectively  referred  to as
U.S. Trust),  which merged with CSC in 2000,  is a wealth  management  firm that
through its subsidiaries  also provides  fiduciary  services and private banking
services.  Charles  Schwab  Bank,  N.A.  (Schwab  Bank),  is a retail bank which
commenced operations in April 2003.
     Other  subsidiaries  of CSC include Charles Schwab  Investment  Management,
Inc. (CSIM), Schwab Capital Markets L.P. (SCM), CyberTrader, Inc. (CyberTrader),
and The Charles Schwab Trust Company (CSTC).  CSIM is the investment advisor for
Schwab's proprietary mutual funds. The Company refers to certain funds for which
CSIM is the  investment  advisor as the SchwabFunds(R). SCM is a market maker in
Nasdaq, exchange-listed, and other securities providing trade execution services
primarily to broker-dealers and institutional clients. CyberTrader, a subsidiary
acquired  in 2000,  is an  electronic  trading  technology  and  brokerage  firm
providing services to highly active,  online traders. CSTC serves as trustee for
employee benefit plans, primarily 401(k) plans.

                              Available Information

     On the Company's Internet website,  www.aboutschwab.com,  the Company posts
the  following  filings  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable  after  they  are
electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC): the Company's annual report on Form 10-K, the Company's quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q,  the Company's current reports on Form 8-K,  and any amendments to
those  reports  filed or  furnished  pursuant  to Section  13(a) or 15(d) of the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934. All such filings on the Company's  website are
available free of charge.

                                Subsequent Event

     On February 10,  2004, the Company  announced Schwab Personal  Choice,  its
suite of investing and advice services for individual investors. Schwab Personal
Choice(TM) consists of eight  different  offers  that  range  from   low-priced,
technology-based active trading to highly customized wealth management delivered
by independent  investment  advisors (IAs),  with a range of  self-directed  and
advised  investing  services in  between.  In  combination  with  services  from
U.S. Trust and CyberTrader, Schwab Personal Choice is designed to give investors
control over the level of trading  technology,  service and advice they utilize,
the  level of  professional  involvement  in  their  portfolio  management  they
receive,  and how they pay for those  services.  In  addition,  Schwab  Personal
Choice is designed so that clients are guided to appropriate  service  solutions
based  primarily on their needs and  preferences,  rather than portfolio size or
trading frequency.

(b)  Financial Information About Segments

     The  Company  provides  financial  services to  individuals,  institutional
clients,  and  broker-dealers  through  four  segments  -  Individual  Investor,
Institutional Investor, Capital Markets, and U.S. Trust. The Individual Investor
segment  includes the Company's  retail  brokerage and banking  operations.  The
Institutional Investor segment provides custodial,  trading and support services
to IAs, serves company 401(k) plan sponsors and third-party administrators,  and
supports  company stock option plans. The Capital Markets segment provides trade
execution services in Nasdaq, exchange-listed, and other securities primarily to
broker-dealers,  including  Schwab,  and institutional  clients.  The U.S. Trust
segment provides investment, wealth management,  custody, fiduciary, and private
banking  services  to  individual  and  institutional   clients.  For  financial
information by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2003, see note "27
- - Segment Information" in the Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements in the
Company's 2003 Annual Report to  Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by
reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.

(c)  Narrative Description of Business

                                Business Strategy

     The Company's  primary strategy is to meet the financial  services needs of
individual  investors  and  independent  IAs. To sustain  and advance  this core
franchise,  the Company remains  focused on improving  service for these clients
and building stronger  relationships  with them. The Company provides  investors
and IAs with  products  and  services  that are  tailored  to (a) support a full
spectrum  of  investment  styles and life  stages,  and (b) utilize its scale in
trading, operations, distribution and marketing.
     Given that product and service  offerings are frequently  replicable across
financial  services firms,  management  believes that the Company's  strategy is
differentiated  much more by how it  approaches  client  service than by what is

                                     - 1 -

actually  offered.  The  Company's  vision is to be the most  useful and ethical
provider of financial  services in the world.  This goal is pursued by combining
people and  technology  in unique  ways.  People  provide  the client  focus and
personal touch that serving investors  requires - the attitudes,  training,  and
incentives of Company  employees  reinforce  the  "ethical"  part of the vision.
Technology helps create services that are scaleable, consistent, and great value
for the money,  enabling the delivery of highly useful and relevant offerings to
the broadest possible array of clients.
     Management  believes that its ability to combine  people and  technology is
key to improving its competitive  position - other investment firms either offer
technology-based  self-service investing, or relationship-based  investing built
around individual brokers with inconsistent advice and high pricing. The Company
endeavors to offer a range of choices,  which combine  people and  technology to
provide the best of personal touch,  consistency,  insight, and value.  Actively
trading  investors have access to information,  guidance and technology  through
both Schwab and  CyberTrader.  Investors  with a  longer-term  focus who wish to
manage and  administer  their  investments  independently  can  access  help and
guidance,  as well as  extensive  investment  research,  news  and  information,
through  Schwab's live and  automated  channels.  Investors  looking for ongoing
access to advice  have the  choice -  depending  on the degree and nature of the
investment  insight,  money  management  and wealth  services  they  desire - of
working with Schwab  investment  consultants,  independent  IAs, or U.S. Trust's
client service officers. IAs can access custody,  trading,  technology and other
support  services through  Schwab's  Services for Investment  Managers unit. All
clients  have  access  to a broad  and  growing  array of  banking  and  lending
services, mutual funds, individual equities and fixed income securities.
     The Company is currently concentrating on three main avenues for growth:
     Offering an increasing  array of investing and financial  services that are
designed to help  clients  achieve  better  outcomes and thereby  establish  and
reinforce  long-lasting  relationships.   A  growing  selection  of  value-added
services  can also help to increase the  Company's  scale and  productivity  and
maximize the value of its marketing and service  investments.  Current  examples
include portfolio and financial  planning for individual  investors,  succession
planning support for independent  advisors,  estate and wealth planning for high
net worth individuals, and trading strategy seminars for active traders.
     Further  broadening the product  footprint by adding products that existing
clients  may be  utilizing  elsewhere,  which in turn  enables  the  Company  to
maximize  relationship value - clients gain increased  convenience,  utility and
benefits while the firm gains enhanced  revenues.  Examples of products added or
expanded in recent years include options and futures trading for active traders,
banking  services  for  long-term   investors,   specialized  mutual  funds  for
independent advisors, and private banking for high net worth individuals.
     Diversifying   into   businesses  that  leverage  the  Company's  core,  to
strengthen  its  ability to reach and serve core  clients  and to develop a more
varied  revenue  stream.  For  example,  SCM's  institutional  equities  trading
business brings together both retail and institutional  order flow in a way that
supports  high quality  trade  executions  for all clients,  as well as provides
institutional investors with research that can also be offered to certain IA and
individual clients.  Schwab's Corporate Services unit serves the retirement plan
needs of  corporations,  levering the  Company's  technology,  open-architecture
mutual fund offering and brand for the benefit of their employees, who, in turn,
can become Schwab clients in their own right.
     For  further   discussion  on  the   Company's   business   strategy,   see
"Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Results of  Operations  and Financial
Condition - Description  of Business - Business  Strategy" in the Company's 2003
Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is  incorporated  herein by reference to
Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.
     The table below shows the  Company's  sources of revenues on a  comparative
basis for the three years ended December 31, 2003.

management,  financial  planning,  and wealth  management  solutions.  Through a
separate  program,  certain  Schwab  clients  and  potential  clients who desire
personalized  investment  management,  wealth  management,  trust,  and  private
banking services can receive referrals to U.S. Trust.

     Actively  Trading  Investors.  The Company strives to deliver  information,

investments,  alternative investments,  fixed income securities,  and short-term
cash  management.  Institutional  clients can also utilize the Excelsior  funds.
Additionally,   U.S. Trust  offers  to  its  institutional  clients  investment,
consulting, and fiduciary services for employee stock ownership plans.

Mutual Fund Services

     The Company provides mutual fund services  primarily through the Individual
Investor,  Institutional Investor, and U.S. Trust segments. Schwab's Mutual Fund
Marketplace(R)  provides clients with the ability to invest in over 3,100 mutual
funds from a wide variety of fund companies. Within the Mutual Fund Marketplace,
Schwab's  Mutual Fund  OneSource(R)  service offers clients access to over 1,700
no-load  mutual  funds  from  a  variety  of  fund  families  without  incurring
transaction fees. The Mutual Fund Marketplace also includes Schwab's mutual fund
clearing  service,  which provides mutual fund trading and clearing  services to
broker-dealers.
     Schwab's Mutual Fund OneSource  service allows investors to access multiple
mutual fund companies,  avoid brokerage transaction fees, and achieve investment
diversification  among fund  families.  Fees  received  by Schwab for  providing
services, including recordkeeping and shareholder services, from the Mutual Fund
OneSource program are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in
the  participating  funds  through  Schwab and are paid by the funds and/or fund
sponsors.
     Schwab  charges a  transaction  fee on trades  placed  in  non-Mutual  Fund
OneSource funds included in the Mutual Fund Marketplace. These fees are recorded
as commission  revenues.  In addition to the third-party funds available through
the  Mutual  Fund  Marketplace,  Schwab  offers a

                                     - 5 -

family of proprietary funds,  referred to as the SchwabFunds(R),  and U.S. Trust
offers the Excelsior(R)  family of funds.  Fees received by the Company from the
SchwabFunds  and  the  Excelsior  Funds,  for  providing  shareholder  services,
administration, investment management and other services, are based upon the net
asset value of the funds.

Client Financing and Clearing Services

     Clients'  securities  transactions are conducted on either a cash or margin
basis. In an account  authorized for margin trading,  Schwab may lend a client a
portion of the market value of certain securities up to the limit established by
the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System  (Federal  Reserve Board),
which  for  most  equity   securities   is  initially   50%.   These  loans  are
collateralized  by the  securities  in the  client's  account.  Short  sales  of
securities  represent sales of borrowed  securities and create an obligation for
the  client  to  purchase  the  securities  at a later  date.  Clients  may sell
securities  short in a margin  account  subject to minimum equity and applicable
margin  requirements  and the availability of such securities to be borrowed and
delivered.  Interest on margin loans to clients  provides an important source of
revenue to Schwab.
     In permitting a client to engage in transactions,  Schwab faces credit risk
if the  client  fails to meet his or her  obligations  in the  event of  adverse
changes in the market value of the  securities  positions in his or her account.
Under applicable rules and regulations for margin  transactions,  Schwab, in the
event of such an adverse  change,  requires  the  client to  deposit  additional
securities or cash, or reduce  positions,  when  necessary so that the amount of
the client's  obligation is not greater than  specified  percentages of the cash
and  market  values of the  securities  in the  account.  As a matter of policy,
Schwab  generally  requires  its  clients  to  maintain  higher  percentages  of
collateral values than the minimum percentages required under these regulations.
     Schwab may use cash balances in client  accounts to extend margin credit to
other clients.  Pursuant to the requirements of Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Rule  15c3-3),  the portion of such cash balances not used
to extend margin credit (increased or decreased by certain other  client-related
balances) must be held in segregated investment accounts.  The balances in these
segregated investment accounts must be invested in cash or qualified securities,
as defined by  Rule 15c3-3.  See also  "Management's  Discussion and Analysis of
Results of Operations and Financial  Condition - Risk  Management - Credit Risk"
in the  Company's  2003 Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is  incorporated
herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report, and "Regulation" in this
report.
     Schwab performs  clearing  services for all securities  transactions in its
client  accounts.  Schwab is  obligated  to settle  transactions  with  clearing
corporations,  mutual funds and other  financial  institutions  even if Schwab's
client or a counterparty  fails to meet his or her  obligations  to Schwab.  See
note "25 - Financial  Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk
or  Market  Risk"  in the  Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in the
Company's 2003 Annual Report to  Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by
reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.


                                Service Delivery

     Consistent with its strategy of combining  people and technology to provide
high-quality service, the Company's multi-channel delivery systems allow clients
to choose how they prefer to do business  with the  Company.  In addition to its
network of 339 domestic branch offices in 48 states,  as well as a branch in the
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,  Schwab  maintains  automated online and telephonic
channels, primarily serving retail investors through the Individual Investor and
Institutional  Investor  segments.  Schwab also maintains  four regional  client
telephone  service  centers,  located  in  Denver,  Indianapolis,  Orlando,  and
Phoenix,  which handle client  trading,  advice,  and service calls.  U.S. Trust
maintains  37  offices  in 15 states  serving  clients  through  the U.S.  Trust
segment.
     While most client  transactions  are completed  through the online channel,
the Company  continues  to stress the  importance  of blending  the power of the
Internet with personal service to create a full-service  client experience.  The
Company's online channels handled 87% of total trades in 2003.
     The  Company's  ongoing  investment  in  technology  is a  key  element  in
expanding its product and service  offerings,  enhancing  its delivery  systems,
providing fast and consistent  client service,  reducing  processing  costs, and
facilitating  the Company's  ability to handle  significant  increases in client
activity  without a  corresponding  rise in staffing  levels.  The Company  uses
technology  to empower its clients to manage  their  financial  affairs and is a
leader in driving technological advancements in the financial services industry.
     For a  discussion  on the  Company's  technology  and  operating  risk  and
procedures for risk identification, assessment and mitigation, see "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial  Condition - Risk
Management - Technology and Operating  Risk" in the Company's 2003 Annual Report
to Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1
of this report, and "Regulation" in this report.


                             Advertising and Brands

     The Company  maintains  three  distinct  brands - Schwab,  U.S. Trust,  and
CyberTrader - by sustaining a consistent level

                                     - 6 -

of  visibility  in the  marketplace.  The  Company's  advertising  and marketing
programs support its strategy by reinforcing the strengths and key attributes of
Schwab's  full-service  offering,  U.S. Trust's wealth management services,  and
CyberTrader's  trading  technology.  The Company primarily uses a combination of
network,  cable and local television,  print media,  direct mail, athletic event
sponsorship, and online channels in its advertising.


                                    Employees

     As of December 31, 2003, the Company had full-time, part-time and temporary
employees,  and  persons  employed  on a  contract  basis that  represented  the
equivalent of 16,300 full-time employees.


                                 Risk Management

     The  Company's  business and  activities  expose it to  different  types of
risks.  Proper  identification,  assessment,  and  management of these risks are
essential  to  the  success  and  financial  soundness  of  the  Company.  For a
discussion  on the  Company's  principal  risks  and  some of the  policies  and
procedures for risk identification, assessment and mitigation, see "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial  Condition - Risk
Management"  in the  Company's  2003  Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is
incorporated  herein by  reference  to  Exhibit  No. 13.1  of this  report,  and
"Regulation" in this report.


                              Business Environment

     The Company's business, like that of other securities brokerage and related
financial services firms, is directly affected by the fluctuations in securities
trading volumes and price levels that occur in fundamentally  cyclical financial
markets,  by changes in government  monetary  policies that impact the growth of
bank loans and investments and the level of interest  charged for loans and paid
on  deposits  and other  funding  sources,  and by changes  in the  geopolitical
environment.  The Company may experience significant variations in revenues from
period to period  depending on changes in these factors and the overall business
environment.  Given the  nature of the  Company's  revenues,  expenses  and risk
profile,  the Company's  earnings and CSC's common stock price may be subject to
significant  volatility from period to period.  For a discussion of the business
environment  faced by the  Company in 2003,  see  "Management's  Discussion  and
Analysis of Results of  Operations  and  Financial  Condition -  Description  of
Business - Overview" in the Company's 2003 Annual Report to Stockholders,  which
is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit No.13.1 of this report.


                                   Competition

     The Company faces significant competition from companies seeking to attract
client financial assets,  including  traditional,  discount and online brokerage
firms, mutual fund companies,  banks, and asset management and wealth management
companies.  For a discussion of competition,  see  "Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Results of  Operations  and  Financial  Condition - Risk  Management
- - Competition" in the  Company's  2003 Annual Report to  Stockholders,  which is
incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.


                                   Regulation

     CSC is a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company
subject to  supervision  and  regulation by the Federal  Reserve Board under the
Bank  Holding  Company Act of 1956,  as amended.  CSC's  depository  institution
subsidiaries, including Schwab Bank and affiliates of U.S. Trust, are subject to
regulation  under federal and state law,  including  supervision  by federal and
state  banking   authorities.   For  a  discussion   of  bank  holding   company
requirements,   see  note  "23  -  Regulatory  Requirements"  in  the  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in the  Company's  2003  Annual  Report  to
Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of
this report.
     The  securities  industry  in the United  States is  subject  to  extensive
regulation under both federal and state laws.

                                     - 7 -

Schwab,  SCM, and CyberTrader are registered as broker-dealers with the SEC, the
fifty states,  and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Schwab and CSIM are
registered  as  investment  advisors  with  the  SEC.  Additionally,  Schwab  is
regulated by the Commodities  Futures Trading  Commission (CFTC) with respect to
its introduced futures and commodities trading activities.
     Much  of  the   regulation  of   broker-dealers   has  been   delegated  to
self-regulatory  organizations (SROs), namely the national securities exchanges.
Schwab is a member of most of the major  national  securities  exchanges  and is
consequently  subject to their rules and regulations.  The primary regulators of
Schwab,  SCM, and CyberTrader  include the New York Stock Exchange  (NYSE),  the
National  Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), and the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board. The National Futures  Association (NFA) has been designated by
the  CFTC  as  Schwab's  primary  regulator  with  respect  to its  futures  and
commodities  trading  activities.  The  Company's  business  is also  subject to
oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which the Company operates.
     The principal purpose of regulating  broker-dealers and investment advisors
is the  protection of clients and the  securities  markets.  The  regulations to
which  broker-dealers  and investment  advisors are subject cover all aspects of
the securities business,  including sales and trading practices,  publication of
research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients' funds and securities,
capital adequacy,  recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements,  disclosure to
clients,  fiduciary  duties  owed  to  advisory  clients,  and  the  conduct  of
directors, officers and employees.
     New  legislation,  rule  changes,  or  changes  in  the  interpretation  or
enforcement  of  existing  federal,  state  and SRO rules  and  regulations  may
directly  affect  the  operation  and  profitability  of CSC and  its  financial
services  affiliates.  The  profitability  of CSC  and  its  financial  services
affiliates  could also be affected  by rules and  regulations  which  impact the
business and  financial  communities  generally,  including  changes to the laws
governing taxation,  electronic  commerce,  and security of client data. CSC and
its financial services  affiliates are subject to claims,  lawsuits,  regulatory
examinations and other proceedings in the ordinary course of business, which can
result in censure,  fine, cease and desist orders, or suspension or expulsion of
such affiliate, its officers, or employees.
     As registered broker-dealers, certain subsidiaries of CSC, including Schwab
and SCM,  are subject to SEC Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital  Rule) and related SRO
requirements.  The CFTC and NFA also  impose net capital  requirements.  The Net
Capital Rule specifies minimum capital  requirements that are intended to ensure
the general  financial  soundness and liquidity of  broker-dealers.  Because CSC
itself is not a registered  broker-dealer,  it is not subject to the Net Capital
Rule.  However,  if Schwab or SCM  failed to  maintain  specified  levels of net
capital,  such  failure  would  constitute  a default by CSC under  certain debt
covenants.
     The Net Capital Rule limits broker-dealers'  ability to transfer capital to
parent  companies  and other  affiliates.  Compliance  with the Net Capital Rule
could limit Schwab's or SCM's operations and their ability to repay subordinated
debt to CSC,  which in turn could  limit CSC's  ability to repay debt,  pay cash
dividends and purchase shares of its outstanding  stock. See also  "Management's
Discussion  and  Analysis of Results of  Operations  and  Financial  Condition -
Liquidity  and  Capital  Resources  -  Liquidity"  and  note  "23  -  Regulatory
Requirements" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company's
2003 Annual Report to Stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference to
Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.

unqualified  opinion  and  includes  an  explanatory  paragraph  relating  to an
accounting  change);  such  consolidated  financial  statements  and  report are

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------


3.   Long-term Debt

     Long-term debt consists of Senior Medium-Term Notes,  Series A (Medium-Term
     Notes).  At December 31,  2003, CSC had  $466 million  aggregate  principal
     amount of Medium-Term Notes  outstanding with maturities  ranging from 2004
     to  2010  and  fixed  interest  rates  ranging  from  6.04%  to  8.05%.  At
     December 31,   2003,  the  Medium-Term  Notes  carried  a  weighted-average
     interest rate of 7.31%.

     At December 31,  2002, CSC had $566 million  aggregate  principal amount of
     Medium-Term Notes outstanding with maturities ranging from 2003 to 2010 and
     fixed interest rates ranging from 6.04% to 8.05%. At December 31, 2002, the
     Medium-Term Notes carried a weighted-average interest rate of 7.29%.

                                      F-6

     CSC uses interest rate swap agreements  (Swaps) to effectively  convert the
     interest rate  characteristics  of a portion of its Medium-Term  Notes from
     fixed to variable.  These Swaps are  structured  for CSC to receive a fixed
     rate  of  interest  and  pay a  variable  rate  of  interest  based  on the
     three-month  LIBOR  rate.  The  variable  interest  rates reset every three
     months. Information on these Swaps is summarized in the following table:

     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     December 31,                                           2003       2002
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Notional principal amount (in millions)               $ 293      $ 293
     Weighted-average variable interest rate               3.62%      3.87%
     Weighted-average fixed interest rate                  7.57%      7.57%
     Weighted-average maturity (in years)                    5.3        6.3
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     These Swaps have been  designated  as fair value hedges under  Statement of
     Financial   Accounting  Standards  No.  133  -  Accounting  for  Derivative
     Instruments  and Hedging  Activities,  and are  recorded  on the  condensed
     balance sheet.  Changes in fair value of the Swaps are completely offset by
     changes in fair value of the hedged Medium-Term Notes. Therefore,  there is
     no effect on net income.  At December  31,  2003 and 2002,  CSC  recorded a
     derivative  asset of $19 million and $26 million,  respectively,  for these
     Swaps.  Concurrently,  the  carrying  value of the  Medium-Term  Notes  was
     increased  by $19 million  and $26  million at December  31, 2003 and 2002,
     respectively.

     Annual maturities on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2003 are as
     follows (in millions):

     Thereafter                                                            208

5.   Commitments and Guarantees

     In  2003,  the  Company  adopted  Financial   Accounting   Standards  Board
     Interpretation  (FIN) No. 46 - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
     and consolidated a special purpose trust (Trust) that was formed in 2000 to
     finance the  acquisition and renovation of an office building and land, see
     note "2 -  Significant  Accounting  Policies" in the Notes to  Consolidated
     Financial  Statements in the Company's 2003 Annual Report to  Stockholders,
     which is  incorporated  herein by  reference  to Exhibit  No.  13.1 of this
     report.  Upon adoption of FIN No. 46, the Company recorded the building and
     land at a cost of $245 million;  accumulated depreciation of $16 million; a
     note payable of $235 million;  and a net reduction of accrued  expenses and
     other liabilities of $7 million.  Additionally,  the Company has guaranteed
     the debt of the Trust up to a maximum of $202 million.  The lender does not
     have recourse to any other assets of the Company.

     CSC has  provided  certain  indemnification  agreements  (i.e.,  protection
     against  damage  or  loss)  to   counterparties   in  connection  with  the
     disposition  of  certain of the  Company's  assets.  Such  indemnifications
     relate to employee terminations,  ownership of intellectual property rights
     (e.g., patents), accuracy of financial statements, compliance with laws and
     regulations,  and  misrepresentations.   At  December 31,   2003,  CSC  had
     indemnification  agreements  with  various  expiration  dates and a maximum
     potential  liability of  approximately  $100 million.  CSC does not believe
     that any  material  loss  related  to such  indemnifications  is likely and
     therefore no liability has been recognized.
