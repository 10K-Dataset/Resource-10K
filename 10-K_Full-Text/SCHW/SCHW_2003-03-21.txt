                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION


                                     PART I


Item 1. Business

(a) General Development of Business

     The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC, and with its subsidiaries collectively
referred to as the Company) was  incorporated  in 1986 and engages,  through its
subsidiaries,  in securities  brokerage and related financial services.  Charles
Schwab  & Co.,  Inc.  (Schwab)  was  incorporated  in 1971  and is a  securities
broker-dealer  that entered the discount  brokerage business in 1974. U.S. Trust
Corporation  (USTC, and with its subsidiaries  collectively  referred to as U.S.
Trust),  which  merged with CSC in May 2000,  is a wealth  management  firm that
through its subsidiaries  also provides  fiduciary  services and private banking
services.
     Other  subsidiaries  of CSC include Charles Schwab  Investment  Management,
Inc. (CSIM), Schwab Capital Markets L.P. (SCM), CyberTrader, Inc. (CyberTrader),
and The Charles Schwab Trust Company (CSTC). CSIM acts as the investment advisor
for Schwab's  proprietary  mutual funds. The Company refers to certain funds for
which  CSIM is the  investment  advisor as the  SchwabFunds(R).  SCM is a market
maker  in  Nasdaq  and  other  securities  providing  trade  execution  services
primarily to broker-dealers and institutional clients. CyberTrader, a subsidiary
acquired in March 2000, is an electronic  trading  technology and brokerage firm
providing services to highly active,  online traders. CSTC serves as trustee for
employee benefit plans, primarily 401(k) plans.

                              Available Information

     On the Company's Internet Web site,  www.schwab.com,  the Company posts the
following   filings   as  soon  as   reasonably   practicable   after  they  are
electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC): the Company's annual report on Form 10-K, the Company's quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q, the Company's  current  reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to
those  reports  filed or  furnished  pursuant  to Section  13(a) or 15(d) of the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934. All such filings on the Company's Web site are
available free of charge.

                                Subsequent Events

     On January 31, 2003,  the Company  sold  Charles  Schwab  Europe  (CSE),  a
subsidiary  located in the United  Kingdom,  to  Barclays  PLC  (Barclays)  in a
transaction  approved by the Board of Directors (Board) on January 30, 2003. The
impact of this sale on the Company's results of operations is not expected to be
material.  See  note  "27 -  Subsequent  Event"  in the  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements in the Company's 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders,  which
is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.
     On  March  13,  2003,  the  Company  announced  that  due  to  geopolitical
uncertainties and a further decline in its clients' trading  activity,  it plans
to  implement  a series of  expense  reduction  measures  until such time as the
business   environment   improves   sufficiently.   These  measures   include  a
postponement of some of the Company's planned marketing investments,  reductions
in discretionary  expenses,  further  restrictions on hiring, and adjustments to
certain  employee  benefits.  These  measures are  targeted to reduce  quarterly
expenses by about $40 million, largely beginning in the second quarter of 2003.
     On  March  14,  2003,  the  Board  authorized  the  repurchase  of up to an
additional $250 million of CSC's common stock.  Including $100 million remaining
under an  authorization  granted by the Board on September 20, 2001, CSC now has
authority to repurchase a total of $350 million of its common stock.  The shares
may be  repurchased  through  open market or privately  negotiated  transactions
based on prevailing market conditions.
     On March 19,  2003,  the Company  announced  an  agreement  to sell its 50%
ownership  interest  in  Glasgow,  Scotland-based  Aitken  Campbell to its joint
venture partner,  TD Waterhouse Group, Inc. The sale is expected to close in the
next few months,  subject to regulatory  and other  approvals.  While  financial
terms are undisclosed, the Company expects to recognize a tax benefit associated
with this transaction; the effect of this benefit will be to increase net income
by approximately $10 million in the first quarter of 2003. Except for the effect
of the tax  benefit,  the  impact  of  this  sale on the  Company's  results  of
operations is not expected to be material.

geographic  area,  and for  revenues  by major  client for the three years ended
December  31,  2002,  see  note  "25 -  Segment  Information"  in the  Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  in the  Company's  2002  Annual  Report  to
Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of
this report.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

                                Business Strategy

     The  Company's  primary  strategy  is to  serve  the  needs  of  individual
investors  either  directly  or  indirectly  through  intermediaries,   IAs,  or
corporate  retirement  plan  sponsors.  Meeting these  investment  needs entails
offering a variety of financial services including retail brokerage,  investment
and wealth management, custody and fiduciary services, support services for IAs,
investment  services to companies and their employees  (including 401(k) defined
contribution  plans),  equity  securities  market-making,  and banking and other
financial services.  Additionally,  the Company provides  institutional  clients
with equity trade execution services, mutual fund clearing services,  investment
management,  and  fiduciary  services.  The Company,  through its  subsidiaries,
serves 8.0 million  active client  accounts(a).  Client assets in these accounts
totaled $764.8 billion at December 31, 2002.
     To pursue its strategy and its  objective of long-term  profitable  growth,
the Company plans to leverage its  competitive  advantages,  which include:
- -    a broad range of products, services, and advice offerings,
- -    multi-channel delivery systems,
- -    an ongoing investment in technology, and
- -    nationally recognized brands.
     Management  continues to believe that the key to  sustaining  the Company's
competitive  advantages  will be its ability to combine people and technology in
ways that provide investors with the access,  information,  guidance, advice and
control they expect - as well as high-quality service - all at a lower cost than
traditional providers of financial services.
     The  Company's  infrastructure  and  resources  are focused on pursuing six
strategic priorities:
- -    providing   the   spectrum   of   affluent   investors   with  the  advice,
     relationships, and choices that support their desired investment outcomes;
- -    delivering  the  information,  technology,  service,  and pricing needed to
     remain a leader in serving active traders;
- -    continuing to provide  high-quality  service to emerging affluent clients -
     those with less than $250,000 in assets;
- -    providing  individual  investing  services  through  employers,   including
     retirement and option plans as well as personal brokerage accounts;
- -    offering selected banking services and developing  investment products that
     give clients greater control and understanding of their finances; and
- -    retaining a strong capital markets business to address investors' financial
     product and trade execution needs.

Condition - Description  of Business - Business  Strategy" in the Company's 2002
Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is  incorporated  herein by reference to
Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.

initial and secondary public stock offerings, debt underwritings,  and access to
futures and commodities trading. Additionally, Schwab provides clients access to
a variety of life insurance and annuity products through  third-party  insurance
companies.
     Clients approved for margin  transactions may borrow a portion of the price
of certain  securities  purchased  through Schwab, or may sell securities short.
Clients must have specific  approval to trade options;  as of December 31, 2002,
401,000 accounts had such approval. To write uncovered options,  clients must go
through an additional approval process and must maintain a significantly  higher
level of equity in their brokerage accounts.
     Schwab Signature  Client(TM) is designed to serve self-directed  individual
investors who want to manage their own  portfolios.  For these  clients,  Schwab
offers the Schwab  One(R)  account,  which is an asset  management  account that
allows  clients to combine  investments  and cash in one  account.  A client may
access  available  funds in his or her Schwab One account either with a personal
check, a VISA(R) debit card with ATM access, or Schwab  BillPay(R),  in addition
to the Schwab MoneyLink(R)  service offered with all brokerage accounts.  When a
Schwab One client is approved for margin trading, the checks and debit card also
provide access to margin cash available.  For cash balances awaiting investment,
Schwab pays interest to Schwab One clients. Alternatively, qualifying Schwab One
clients may choose to invest in several SchwabFunds(R) sweep money market funds,
including state-specific municipal tax-exempt funds.
     For  affluent  clients who meet  certain  trading or asset  levels,  Schwab
offers additional benefits such as premium research,  priority handling of their
service calls,  access to IAs, and other services.  Additionally,  Schwab offers
the Schwab Access(R) account to clients with combined assets of $100,000 or more
at Schwab.  The Schwab  Access  account is a payment  account  designed  to work
alongside the Schwab One account,  allowing clients to manage their  investments
and  conduct  many  of  their  cash   management   activities   all  within  one
relationship.  The Schwab Access account  features  include online bill payment,
unlimited check writing, a VISA Gold debit card with ATM access,  returned check
copies, and unlimited money transfers within Schwab accounts. Cash balances in a
Schwab Access account are swept daily into the Schwab  Government  Cash Reserves
Fund, a sweep money fund.
     Schwab Private Client is a fee-based service designed for investors with at
least  $500,000 in assets at Schwab who desire  investment  guidance and advice,
yet want to be actively  involved  with  day-to-day  investment  decisions.  The
Schwab Private Client account is structured with an asset-based  pricing fee and
includes portfolio  construction guidance,  ongoing monitoring,  and a number of
commission-free  equity trades.  Through Schwab Private  Client,  investors have
access to a team of consultants who can provide financial  guidance as discussed
below under "Help and  Advice,  Investment  Education,  Research,  and  Analysis
Tools."
     Schwab  Signature  Platinum(R),  the  successor  to  the  Schwab  Signature
Services(R)  program,  is designed to meet the specific  needs of  self-directed
affluent investors with at least $500,000 in assets at Schwab.  Schwab Signature
Platinum offers a tailored set of  complimentary  benefits,  including  priority
service, an expanded suite of investing resources, and preferred pricing.
     For active  traders,  Schwab offers accounts that include access to special
features and  services  such as advanced  trading  tools,  priority  access to a
dedicated  team of trading  specialists,  and reduced  pricing on equity trades.
Additionally, depending on trading levels, active traders may qualify for Schwab
Strategic  Trading  Resources(TM)  benefits,  which includes access to a team of
trading  experts,  free premium  research  (including  foreign stock  research),
discounted commissions, and other exclusive benefits.  CyberTrader also offers a
brokerage  account to its clients.  Features of this account  include  access to
CyberTrader's proprietary software designed to benefit highly active traders and
the choice of manual or automated order routing for placing trades.
     Schwab acts as  custodian,  as well as broker,  for  Individual  Retirement
Accounts  (IRAs) and Keogh  accounts.  In Schwab IRAs,  cash  balances are swept
daily into one of three  SchwabFunds  money market funds.  Schwab's  IRA-related
services include the Personal  Rollover  Specialist,  a service designed to help
clients  process  transfers of retirement  assets from former  employers  and/or
consolidate  their  retirement  investments.  Active IRAs and Keogh  accounts at
December 31, 2002 totaled 3,500,000,  up 5% from December 31, 2001, while client
assets in all IRAs and Keogh accounts decreased 9% to $184.5 billion.

     Help and Advice,  Investment Education,  Research,  and Analysis Tools. The
Company  seeks to provide  clients with  customized  advice which is  objective,
uncomplicated,  and not driven by sales  commissions.  The Company's approach to
advice is based on  long-term  investment  strategies  and guidance on portfolio
diversification  and asset  allocation.  This approach is designed to be offered
consistently  across all of Schwab's delivery channels and provides clients with
a wide  selection  of choices for their  investment  needs.  Schwab's  products,
services,  and advice  offerings  cross the  spectrum of its clients - those who
manage their own investments and make independent  investment  decisions,  those
who  want  ongoing  access  to  guidance  while  retaining  control  over  their
investment  decisions,  and those who desire to have  experienced  professionals
manage their assets.
     For affluent  investors  who make  independent  investment  decisions,  the
Company  offers  research,  analytic  tools,  and access to fee-based  portfolio
consultations and financial planning services. Clients looking for more guidance
have access to advanced research, trading and planning resources,

                                      - 4-

combined with professional advice from Schwab's investment  specialists designed
to assist in developing an investment  strategy and carrying out  investment and
portfolio management decisions.
     The Company's  full-service advice and relationship  service offer includes
the Schwab Advisor Network(TM) (the Network),  Schwab Private Client, and Schwab
Equity Ratings(TM).
     The Network, the successor to the Schwab AdvisorSource(R) referral program,
is designed for investors who want the assistance of an independent professional
in managing their financial  affairs.  The IAs in the Network provide  investors
with personalized portfolio management, financial planning and wealth management
solutions.  The Network has over 340 participating IAs who have an average of 17
years of experience and $500 million of assets under  management at December 31,
2002. The Network strengthens the  Schwab/advisor/client  relationship through a
pricing  model that  allows for  sharing  fee income on  referred  accounts  and
features IAs more prominently in advertising  that targets  affluent  investors.
Through a separate  program,  Schwab  clients and  potential  clients who desire
personalized  investment  management,  wealth  management,  trust,  and  private
banking services can receive referrals to U.S. Trust.
     Schwab Private Client features a face-to-face  advice  relationship  with a
designated Schwab consultant who offers individualized service, provides ongoing
investment  strategy and execution,  and acts as a liaison between clients and a
team of Schwab  professionals.  Additionally,  Schwab  Private  Client  provides
access to dedicated support resources,  expanded asset management  capabilities,
and enhanced portfolio tracking and performance reporting. Schwab Private Client
includes  over 160  designated  Schwab  consultants  and their  support teams at
December 31, 2002.
     Schwab Equity Ratings provide clients with an objective stock rating system
on more than 3,000 stocks,  assigning each equity a single grade: A, B, C, D, or
F. On average,  A-rated  stocks are expected to strongly  outperform the overall
market over the next 12 months,  while  F-rated  stocks are expected to strongly
underperform  the  market.  Rated  stocks  are  ranked  and the  number  of 'buy
consideration'  ratings - As and Bs - equals the number of 'sell  consideration'
ratings - Ds and Fs.  Schwab Equity  Ratings  leverages  Schwab's  November 2000
acquisition  of Chicago  Investment  Analytics,  Inc.  (CIA) by  applying  CIA's
research  and  technology  strengths to a systematic  ratings  methodology  that
complements  the  variety of  perspectives  already  available  to clients  from
Goldman Sachs, Standard & Poor's, Argus, and First Call.
     Schwab's   MarketPlace   is  an  internal  Web  site  which   includes  the
AdviceSuite, a software platform that enables service representatives to apply a
consistent set of principles and practices when providing market  viewpoints and
investment  advice.  Schwab  enhanced  MarketPlace  to  include  an  'Investment
Products'  home  page  with  lists of  investment  perspectives  across  various
products,  sectors,  and  styles.  MarketPlace  also  provides  tools to support
discussions  with clients about events such as retirement  and college  planning
and charitable  giving.  Schwab's Mutual Fund internal Web site provides service
representatives  with news,  research,  and analytic  tools  designed to support
their fund-related  advice  interactions with clients.  In addition,  to support
service  representatives'  fund-related advice  interactions,  Schwab's internal
Mutual Fund Web site provides  representatives with Morningstar analysis on over
1,400  funds.  Schwab  redesigned  its  Mutual  Fund  Select  List(R) to include
qualitative  analyses  for each asset class as well as an  integrated  view that
includes asset class summaries, category descriptions,  and average expenses for
each fund, presented together on a single page.
     Schwab strives to demystify investing by educating and assisting clients in

     Client Financing and Clearing Services.  Clients'  securities  transactions
are  conducted  on either a cash or margin  basis.  Generally,  a client  buying
securities  in a cash-only  brokerage  account is  required  to make  payment by
settlement  date,  usually  three  business  days  after the trade is  executed.
However,  for purchases of certain types of  securities,  such as certain mutual
fund  shares,  a client must have a cash or money  market fund balance in his or
her account  sufficient  to pay for the trade prior to  execution.  When selling
securities,  a client is required to deliver the securities,  and is entitled to
receive the proceeds,  on settlement  date. In an account  authorized for margin
trading,  Schwab  may lend a client a portion  of the  market  value of  certain
securities up to the limit  established by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System  (Federal  Reserve  Board),  which for most equity  securities is
initially 50%. These loans are  collateralized by the securities in the client's
account.  Short sales of securities  represent sales of borrowed  securities and
create an obligation  for the client to purchase the securities at a later date.
Clients may sell securities  short in a margin account subject to minimum equity
and applicable margin requirements and the availability of such securities to be
borrowed  and  delivered.  Interest  on  margin  loans to  clients  provides  an
important source of revenue to Schwab.  During 2002, Schwab's outstanding margin
loans to clients  averaged  $8.0  billion and were $6.6  billion at December 31,
2002.
     In permitting a client to engage in transactions,  Schwab faces credit risk
if the  client  fails to meet his or her  obligations  in the  event of  adverse
changes in the market value of the  securities  positions in his or her account.
Under applicable rules and regulations for margin  transactions,  Schwab, in the
event of such an adverse  change,  requires  the  client to  deposit  additional
securities or cash, so that the amount of the client's obligation is not greater
than  specified  percentages  of the cash and market values of the securities in
the account.  As a matter of policy,  Schwab  generally  requires its clients to
maintain higher  percentages of collateral  values than the minimum  percentages
required under these regulations.
     Schwab may use cash balances in client  accounts to extend margin credit to
other clients.  Pursuant to the requirements of Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Rule  15c3-3),  the portion of such cash balances not used
to extend margin credit (increased or decreased by certain other  client-related
balances) must be held in segregated investment accounts.  The balances in these
segregated investment accounts must be invested in cash or qualified securities,
as defined by Rule 15c3-3.  To the extent  Schwab's  clients  elect to have cash
balances in their  brokerage  accounts swept into certain  SchwabFunds(R)  money
market  funds,  the cash  balances  available to Schwab for  investments  or for
financing  margin loans are reduced.

However,  Schwab  receives asset  management and  administration  fees from such
funds  based  upon  average  daily  invested  balances.  See also  "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial  Condition - Risk
Management"  in the  Company's  2002  Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is
incorporated  herein by  reference  to  Exhibit  No.  13.1 of this  report,  and
"Regulation" in this report.
     Schwab performs  clearing  services for all securities  transactions in its
client accounts.  Schwab clears the vast majority of client transactions through
the  facilities of The  Depository  Trust & Clearing  Corporation or the Options
Clearing   Corporation.   Certain  other  transactions,   such  as  mutual  fund
transactions and transactions in securities not eligible for settlement  through
a clearing  corporation,  are settled  directly  with the mutual  funds or other
financial institutions. Schwab is obligated to settle transactions with clearing
corporations,  mutual funds and other  financial  institutions  even if Schwab's
client  fails  to meet  his or her  obligations  to  Schwab.  In  addition,  for
transactions that do not settle through a clearing  corporation,  Schwab assumes
the risk of the other  party's  failure  to  settle  the  trade.  See note "23 -
Financial  Instruments Subject to Off-Balance-Sheet  Risk, Credit Risk or Market
Risk" in the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in the Company's 2002
Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is  incorporated  herein by reference to
Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.

     Mutual Funds. The Company provides mutual fund services  primarily  through
the  Individual  Investor,  Institutional  Investor,  and U.S.  Trust  segments.
Schwab's Mutual Fund Marketplace(R)  provides clients with the ability to invest
in over 3,100  mutual funds from a wide  variety of fund  companies.  Within the
Mutual Fund  Marketplace,  Schwab's  Mutual  Fund  OneSource(R)  service  offers
clients  access to over  1,700  no-load  mutual  funds  from a  variety  of fund
families without  incurring  transaction  fees. The Mutual Fund Marketplace also
includes  Schwab's  mutual fund clearing  service,  which  provides  mutual fund
trading and clearing services to banks and broker-dealers.
     Schwab's Mutual Fund OneSource  service allows investors to access multiple
mutual fund companies,  avoid brokerage transaction fees, and achieve investment
diversification among fund families. In addition,  investors'  recordkeeping and
investment  monitoring are simplified through one consolidated  statement.  Fees
received  by  Schwab  for  providing  services,   including   recordkeeping  and
shareholder services,  from the Mutual Fund OneSource program are based upon the
daily  balances of client  assets  invested in the  participating  funds through
Schwab and are paid by the funds and/or fund sponsors. Client assets invested in
third-party  funds that have been  purchased  through the Mutual Fund  OneSource
service were $73.6 billion at December 31, 2002.
     Schwab  charges a  transaction  fee on trades  placed  in  non-Mutual  Fund
OneSource funds included in the Mutual Fund Marketplace. These fees are recorded
as commission  revenues.  In addition to the third-party funds available through
the  Mutual  Fund  Marketplace,  Schwab  offers a family of  proprietary  funds,
referred to as the SchwabFunds(R), and U.S. Trust offers the Excelsior(R) family
of funds.  Fees received by the Company from the  SchwabFunds  and the Excelsior
funds, for providing shareholder services, administration, investment management
and other services, are based upon the net asset value of the funds.
     SchwabFunds  include  money market funds,  equity index funds,  bond funds,
asset allocation  funds,  funds that primarily  invest in stock,  bond and money
market funds, and actively-managed equity funds. Schwab's proprietary funds also
include the Schwab  MarketMasters  Funds(TM),  Schwab Core Equity Fund(TM),  and
Schwab Hedged Equity  Fund(TM).  Schwab  MarketMasters  Funds is a suite of four
funds  designed to spread  investment  risk and reduce  volatility  by employing
third-party investment managers with different styles and strategies. The Schwab
Core Equity Fund and the Schwab Hedged Equity Fund combine the equity  selection
capabilities  of  Schwab  Equity  Ratings(TM)  with  the   diversification   and
convenience of a mutual fund.  Client assets  invested in the  SchwabFunds  were
$144.8 billion at December 31, 2002.
     Excelsior   funds   include   actively-managed   domestic   equity   funds,
international equity funds, taxable fixed income funds,  tax-exempt fixed income
funds and money market funds. Client assets invested in the Excelsior funds were
$12.6 billion at December 31, 2002.

investors  and  non-English-speaking  U.S.  clients.  At December 31, 2002,  the
Company had a presence in the United Kingdom,  Hong Kong and the Cayman Islands.

Capital Markets

     The Company  provides  its clients with quick and  efficient  access to the
securities   markets  by   offering   trade   execution   services   in  Nasdaq,
exchange-listed  and other  securities  through its market maker and  specialist
operations.  Clients  also have the  ability  to access  extended-hours  trading
through the  Company's  participation  in  Archipelago,  an ECN, and analyze and
trade a  variety  of fixed  income  securities  through  Schwab's  multi-channel
delivery systems.
     Schwab has  specialist  operations  on the Boston  Stock  Exchange  to make
markets in exchange-listed  securities. The majority of trades originated by the
clients of Schwab in exchange-listed  securities for which Schwab makes a market
are  directed  to this  operation.  At  December  31,  2002,  Schwab  had  three
specialists  on the Boston Stock  Exchange that made markets in 156  securities.
Additionally,  SCM makes markets in Nasdaq  stocks,  which totaled over 5,000 at
December 31, 2002.
     The Company  continues  to enhance  its trade  execution  capabilities  and
financial product offerings.  Through selective hirings, SCM expanded its equity
trading  capabilities to focus on improving execution services for institutional
clients. Additionally, most Nasdaq marketable orders up to 2,000 shares received
by Schwab for  execution  are routed using  SmartEx(R),  its  proprietary  order
routing  technology  that combines  intelligent  order routing with market maker
liquidity  enhancements.  SmartEx  is  available  for  Schwab

                                     - 8 -

payments directly from the Web site.
     For institutional clients, including corporations, endowments, foundations,
and pension plans, U.S. Trust provides  investment  management,  brokerage,  and
special fiduciary services.  Through these investment management services,  U.S.

specialized   domestic  and   international   equity   investments,   structured
investments,  alternative investments,  fixed income securities,  and short-term

     Additionally,  U.S. Trust offers to its institutional  clients  investment,
consulting and fiduciary  services for employee stock ownership  plans.  Special
fiduciary   services  also  include  trustee   services  for   non-qualified  or
supplemental employee benefit plans, also known as rabbi trusts.


                         Multi-Channel Delivery Systems

     The Company's  multi-channel  delivery  systems allow clients to choose how
they prefer to do business  with the Company.  In addition to its branch  office
network, Schwab maintains four regional client telephone service centers as well
as automated telephonic and online channels,  primarily serving retail investors
through the Individual Investor and Institutional Investor segments.  U.S. Trust
maintains offices serving clients through the U.S. Trust segment.

Office Network

     To  enable   clients  to  obtain   services   in  person   with  a  Company
representative,  the Company  maintains a network of  offices.  At December  31,
2002,  Schwab  operated 388 domestic  branch offices in 48 states,  as well as a
branch in the  Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico.  At December 31, 2002,  U.S.  Trust
operated 34 offices in 12 states.  In  addition,  the Company had offices in the
Cayman Islands,  Hong Kong and the United Kingdom.  The Company's office network
plays a key role in building its business.  With the client  service  support of
regional client  telephone  service centers and automated  telephonic and online
channels, office personnel focus a significant portion of their time on business
development  and help and advice  interactions  with  clients.  Clients  can use
Schwab's  branch  offices  to open  accounts,  deliver  and  receive  checks and
securities,  obtain market information,  place orders, and obtain related client
services in person,  yet most of these  activities  are  conducted by telephone,
mail, and online channels. Schwab's branch offices

                                      - 9-

also provide  investors  with access to the Internet and to Schwab's  registered
representatives   who  can  assist  investors  in  developing  asset  allocation
strategies and evaluating  their  investment  choices.  U.S. Trust's clients can
meet with wealth  management  professionals at regional offices to obtain access
to U.S. Trust's wide array of financial services and products.

Regional Client Telephone Service Centers

     Schwab's four regional client telephone service centers, located in Denver,
Indianapolis, Orlando, and Phoenix, handle client trading and service calls. The
Company closed its telephone service center in Austin,  Texas in 2002 as part of
its restructuring initiatives.
     Schwab's  client  service  approach  is to  use  teams  led  by  registered
representatives  in the service  centers,  who work closely with office  network
personnel.  Additionally,  certain  teams at these centers  provide  specialized
services to affluent  clients.  Each  registered  representative  has  immediate
access to the client account and market-related information necessary to respond
to client  inquiries.  For most client orders,  registered  representatives  can
enter the order and confirm  the  transaction  immediately.  As a result of this
approach, the departure of a registered representative generally does not result
in a loss of clients for Schwab.

Online and Automated Telephonic Channels

     Clients are able to obtain  financial  information and execute trades on an
automated basis through Schwab's automated telephonic and online channels. These
channels  are  designed to provide  added  convenience  for clients and minimize
Schwab's costs of responding to and processing routine client transactions.
     Schwab's  automated  telephonic  channels include  TeleBroker(R) - Schwab's
touch-tone  telephone  quote and  trading  service,  and Schwab by  Phone(TM)  -
Schwab's  voice  recognition  quote  and  trading  service.  Schwab's  automated
telephonic  channels  handled over 70% of client calls received in 2002.  Schwab
handled approximately 59 million automated and live calls received in 2002.
     Online  channels  include the Charles Schwab Web Site, an  information  and
trading service on the Internet at schwab.com(TM);  the Schwab  Institutional(R)
Web site, a platform for IAs to conduct daily activities;  the SchwabPlan(R) Web
site, a service on the Internet at  schwabplan.com  where plan  participants and
sponsors can manage their 401(k) accounts;  and Schwab Wireless(TM),  a wireless
information  and trading  service.  Additionally,  online  mediums  designed for
highly active traders include StreetSmart Pro(R) and Velocity(R), online trading
systems  which provide  enhanced  trade  information  and order  execution,  and
CyberTrader's  integrated  software-based  trading platforms.  While most client
transactions are completed through the online channel,  the Company continues to
stress the  importance  of Clicks and Mortar  access - blending the power of the
Internet with personal service to create a full-service  client experience.  The
Company's online channels handled 83% of total trades in 2002.


                                   Technology

     The  Company's  ongoing  investment  in  technology  is a  key  element  in
expanding its product and service  offerings,  enhancing  its delivery  systems,
providing fast and consistent  client service,  reducing  processing  costs, and
facilitating  the Company's  ability to handle  significant  increases in client
activity  without a  corresponding  rise in staffing  levels.  The Company  uses
technology  to empower its clients to manage  their  financial  affairs and is a
leader in driving technological advancements in the financial services industry.
     The Company's  operations  rely heavily on its  information  processing and
communications  systems.  The  Company's  system  for  processing  a  securities
transaction is highly automated. Registered representatives equipped with online
computer  terminals can access client  account  information,  obtain  securities
prices and related information, and enter orders online.
     To  support  its  multi-channel   delivery   systems,   as  well  as  other
applications such as clearing functions, account administration,  recordkeeping,
and direct  client  access to investment  information,  the Company  maintains a
sophisticated computer network connecting all of the offices and regional client
telephone service centers.  The Company's computers are also linked to the major
registered  U.S.   securities  markets  and  The  Depository  Trust  &  Clearing
Corporation.
     Failure of the Company's information  processing or communications  systems
for a significant  period of time could limit the  Company's  ability to process
its large volume of  transactions  accurately and rapidly.  This could cause the
Company to be unable to satisfy its obligations to clients and other  securities
firms, and could result in regulatory  violations.  External events,  such as an
earthquake,  terrorist  attack, or power failure,  loss of external  information
feeds such as security price information,  as well as internal malfunctions such
as those that could occur  during the  implementation  of system  modifications,
could render part or all of such systems inoperative.
     To enhance the reliability of the system and integrity of data, the Company
maintains backup and recovery  functions.  These include logging of all critical
files intraday,  duplication and storage of all critical data every  twenty-four
hours,  and maintenance of facilities for backup and  communications.  They also
include the  maintenance and periodic  testing of a disaster  recovery plan that
management  believes would permit the Company to recommence  essential  computer
operations if its central computer site were to become inaccessible. To minimize
business  interruptions,  the

                                     - 10 -

Company has data centers  intended,  in part, to further improve the recovery of
business processing in the event of an emergency.


                          Nationally Recognized Brands

     The Company's  advertising and marketing  programs  support its strategy by
continually   reinforcing   the  strengths   and  key   attributes  of  Schwab's
full-service   offering,   U.S.   Trust's  wealth   management   services,   and
CyberTrader's  trading  technology.  In 2002,  Schwab launched a new advertising
campaign  designed to  differentiate  Schwab's service model from those of other
full-service firms.  Additionally,  the Company launched a new print advertising
campaign to increase  awareness  of the U.S.  Trust brand and educate  investors
about wealth management. To build its CyberTrader(R) brand, the Company launched
an advertising  campaign  complemented with promotional offers. By maintaining a
consistent  level  of  visibility  in the  marketplace,  the  Company  seeks  to
establish  Schwab,  U.S. Trust,  and CyberTrader as leading  financial  services
brands in a focused and  cost-effective  manner.  The Company  primarily  uses a
combination of network,  cable and local television,  print media,  direct mail,
athletic event sponsorship, and online channels in its advertising.


                                    Employees

     As of December 31, 2002, the Company had full-time, part-time and temporary
employees,  and  persons  employed  on a  contract  basis that  represented  the
equivalent of 16,700 full-time employees.


                                 Risk Management

     The  Company's  business and  activities  expose it to  different  types of
risks.  Proper  identification,  assessment,  and  management of these risks are
essential  to  the  success  and  financial  soundness  of  the  Company.  For a
discussion  on the  Company's  principal  risks  and  some of the  policies  and
procedures for risk identification, assessment and mitigation, see "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial  Condition - Risk
Management"  in the  Company's  2002  Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is
incorporated  herein by  reference  to  Exhibit  No.  13.1 of this  report,  and
"Technology" and "Regulation" in this report.


                              Business Environment

     The Company's business, like that of other securities brokerage and related
financial services firms, is directly affected by the fluctuations in securities
trading volumes and price levels that occur in fundamentally  cyclical financial
markets,  by changes in government  monetary  policies that impact the growth of
bank loans and investments and the level of interest  charged for loans and paid
on  deposits  and other  funding  sources,  and by changes  in the  geopolitical
environment.  The Company may experience significant variations in revenues from
period to period  depending on changes in these factors and the overall business
environment.  Given the  nature of the  Company's  revenues,  expenses  and risk
profile,  the Company's  earnings and CSC's common stock price may be subject to
significant  volatility from period to period.  For a discussion of the business
environment faced by the Company in 2001 and 2002, see "Management's  Discussion
and  Analysis  of Results of  Operations  and  Financial  Condition - Results of
Operations  -  Financial  Overview"  in the  Company's  2002  Annual  Report  to
Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of
this report.


                                   Competition

     The Company faces significant competition from companies seeking to attract
client financial assets,  including  traditional,  discount and online brokerage
firms, mutual fund companies,  banks, and asset management and wealth management
companies.  For a discussion of competition,  see  "Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Results of Operations  and Financial  Condition - Risk  Management -
Competition"  in the  Company's  2002 Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is
incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.


                                   Regulation

     CSC is a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company
subject to  supervision  and  regulation by the Federal  Reserve Board under the
Bank  Holding  Company Act of 1956,  as amended.  CSC's  depository  institution
subsidiaries   are  subject  to  regulation  and   supervision  and  to  various
requirements and  restrictions  under federal and state law. For a discussion of
bank holding company  requirements,  see note "21 - Regulatory  Requirements" in
the Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in the  Company's  2002 Annual
Report to Stockholders, which is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit No.
13.1 of this report.
     The  securities  industry  in the United  States is  subject  to  extensive
regulation  under both  federal  and state laws.  The

                                     - 11 -

SEC is the federal agency charged with  administration of the federal securities
laws.  Schwab,  SCM, and CyberTrader are registered as  broker-dealers  with the
SEC.  Schwab  and CSIM  are  registered  as  investment  advisors  with the SEC.
Additionally,  Schwab is regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission
(CFTC)  with  respect  to  its  introduced   futures  and  commodities   trading
activities.
     Much  of  the   regulation  of   broker-dealers   has  been   delegated  to
self-regulatory  organizations,  principally the national  securities  exchanges
such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which has been designated by the SEC
as Schwab's primary regulator with respect to its securities activities, and the
NASD,  which has been designated as Schwab's  primary  regulator with respect to
its options trading activities. The NASD has been designated by the SEC as SCM's
and CyberTrader's  primary regulator with respect to its securities  activities.
The  National  Futures  Association  (NFA)  has been  designated  by the CFTC as
Schwab's primary  regulator with respect to its futures and commodities  trading
activities. These self-regulatory organizations adopt rules (subject to approval
by the SEC or CFTC) governing the industry and conduct periodic  examinations of
broker-dealers.  Securities  firms  are  also  subject  to  regulation  by state
securities  authorities in the states in which they do business.  In addition to
its  membership  in the NYSE,  Schwab is also a member of all other  major  U.S.
securities exchanges and is consequently subject to their rules and regulations.
Schwab and SCM were registered as broker-dealers  in fifty states,  the District
of Columbia and Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2002.
     The principal  purpose of regulating and  disciplining  broker-dealers  and
investment  advisors is the  protection of clients and the  securities  markets,
rather than  protection  of creditors and  stockholders  of  broker-dealers  and
investment  advisors.  The  regulations to which  broker-dealers  and investment
advisors are subject  cover all aspects of the  securities  business,  including
sales methods,  trading practices among broker-dealers,  uses and safekeeping of
clients'  funds  and  securities,   capital   structure  of  securities   firms,
recordkeeping and reporting,  fee arrangements,  disclosure to clients,  and the
conduct of directors, officers and employees. As registered investment advisors,
Schwab and CSIM are subject to the  requirements of the Investment  Advisers Act
of 1940 and the  regulations  thereunder,  which  impose,  among  other  things,
various  recordkeeping,   reporting,  and  disclosure  requirements  and  impose
limitations  on fees and  principal  transactions  between  an  advisor  and its
clients.
     Additional  legislation,  changes in rules  promulgated  by the SEC,  other
federal and state regulatory authorities, and self-regulatory organizations,  or
changes in the  interpretation  or  enforcement  of existing  laws and rules may
directly affect the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers  and
investment advisors. The profitability of broker-dealers and investment advisors
could also be affected by rules and  regulations  which  impact the business and
financial  communities  in  general,  including  changes  to the laws  governing
taxation,   antitrust  regulation,  and  electronic  commerce.  The  SEC,  CFTC,
self-regulatory  organizations,  and state  securities  authorities  may conduct
civil or administrative proceedings which can result in censure, fine, cease and
desist orders,  or suspension or expulsion of a  broker-dealer  or an investment
advisor,  its officers,  or  employees.  Schwab and SCM have been the subject of
such administrative proceedings.
     As registered  broker-dealers and NASD member  organizations,  Schwab, SCM,
and CyberTrader are required by federal law to belong to the Securities Investor
Protection  Corporation (SIPC), which provides,  in the event of the liquidation
of a  broker-dealer,  protection for securities  held in client accounts held by
the firm of up to $500,000 per client,  subject to a limitation  of $100,000 for
claims  of cash  balances.  SIPC is funded  through  assessments  on  registered
broker-dealers.  In addition,  Schwab  purchased  from a private  surety company
account  protection for clients above the SIPC limit,  as defined,  of up to the
net equity value for client securities and cash in each account.  Stocks, bonds,
mutual  funds,  options,  unit  investment  trusts,  and money  market funds are
considered  securities  for the purposes of SIPC  protection  and the additional
protection (i.e.,  protected securities may either be replaced or converted into
an equivalent market value as of the date a SIPC trustee is appointed).  Neither
SIPC  protection nor the additional  protection  applies to  fluctuations in the
market value of securities.
     Schwab  is  authorized  by the  Municipal  Securities  Rulemaking  Board to
conduct  transactions  in municipal  securities on behalf of its clients and has
obtained  certain  additional  registrations  with the SEC and state  regulatory
agencies necessary to permit it to engage in certain other activities incidental
to its brokerage business.
     Margin  lending by Schwab  and SCM is  subject  to the margin  rules of the
Federal Reserve Board and the NYSE. Under such rules, broker-dealers are limited
in the amount they may lend in connection with certain purchases and short sales
of securities and are also required to impose certain  maintenance  requirements
on the amount of securities and cash held in margin accounts. In addition, those
rules and rules of the  Chicago  Board  Options  Exchange  govern  the amount of
margin clients must provide and maintain in writing uncovered options.
     As a California  state-chartered trust company, CSTC is primarily regulated
by the  State of  California  Department  of  Financial  Institutions.  Since it
provides  employee benefit plan trust services,  CSTC is also required to comply
with  the  Employee   Retirement  Income  Security  Act  of  1974  (ERISA)  and,
consequently,  is subject to oversight by both the Internal  Revenue Service and
Department  of Labor.  CSTC is required  under ERISA to maintain a fidelity bond
for the protection of employee benefit trusts for which it serves as trustee.

                                     - 12 -

     The Company's  business is also subject to  regulation by various  non-U.S.
governments,  securities exchanges, and regulatory bodies, particularly in those
countries  where it has  acquired  subsidiaries.  Such  regulation  may directly
affect  the method of  operation  and  profitability  of the  Company's  foreign
operations.
     As registered broker-dealers, certain subsidiaries of CSC, including Schwab
and SCM,  are subject to the Uniform Net Capital  Rule (Rule  15c3-1)  under the
Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934 (the Net  Capital  Rule),  which has also been
adopted  through  incorporation  by reference in NYSE Rule 325. The CFTC and NFA
also impose net capital requirements. The Net Capital Rule specifies minimum net
capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness
and  liquidity of  broker-dealers.  Failure to maintain the required net capital
may subject a firm to suspension or expulsion by the NYSE and the NASD,  certain
punitive  actions by the SEC and other  regulatory  bodies,  and  ultimately may
require  a  firm's   liquidation.   Because  CSC  itself  is  not  a  registered
broker-dealer,  it is not subject to the Net Capital Rule. However, if Schwab or
SCM failed to maintain  specified  levels of net  capital,  such  failure  would
constitute a default by CSC under certain debt covenants.
     "Net   capital"  is   essentially   defined  as  net  worth  (assets  minus
liabilities),  plus qualifying subordinated borrowings,  less certain deductions
that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and
from  conservatively  valuing  certain other assets.  These  deductions  include
charges  that  discount  the value of firm  security  positions  to reflect  the
possibility of adverse changes in market value prior to disposition.
     The Net Capital Rule requires  notice of equity  capital  withdrawals to be
provided to the SEC prior to and  subsequent to  withdrawals  exceeding  certain
sizes. Such rule prohibits  withdrawals that would reduce a broker-dealer's  net
capital to an amount less than 25% of its deductions required by the Net Capital
Rule as to its  security  positions.  The Net Capital  Rule also allows the SEC,
under limited circumstances, to restrict a broker-dealer from withdrawing equity
capital for up to twenty business days.
     Schwab and SCM have elected the  alternative  method of  calculation  under
paragraph  (a)(1)(ii) of the Net Capital Rule, which requires a broker-dealer to
maintain  minimum net capital equal to the greater of 2% of its "aggregate debit
items,"  computed in accordance  with the Formula for  Determination  of Reserve
Requirements  for Brokers and Dealers  under Rule  15c3-3,  or a minimum  dollar
amount,  which is based on the type of business  conducted by the broker-dealer.
The minimum  dollar  amount for both  Schwab and SCM is $1  million.  "Aggregate
debit items" are assets that have as their  source  transactions  with  clients,
primarily margin loans.  Under the alternative method of the Net Capital Rule, a
broker-dealer  may not (a) pay,  or permit  the  payment or  withdrawal  of, any
subordinated borrowings or (b) pay cash dividends or permit equity capital to be
removed if, after giving effect to such payment, withdrawal, or removal, its net
capital would be less than 5% of its aggregate debit items.
     Under NYSE Rule 326,  Schwab is required to reduce its  business if its net
capital  is less  than  4% of  aggregate  debit  items  for  more  than  fifteen
consecutive  business  days;  NYSE  Rule 326 also  prohibits  the  expansion  of
business if net capital is less than 5% of  aggregate  debit items for more than
fifteen  consecutive  business days. The provisions of NYSE Rule 326 also become
operative if capital withdrawals (including scheduled maturities of subordinated
borrowings  during the  following  six months)  would result in a reduction of a
firm's net capital to the levels indicated.
     If compliance  with  applicable net capital rules were to limit Schwab's or
SCM's  operations and their ability to repay  subordinated  debt to CSC, this in
turn could limit CSC's  ability to repay debt,  pay cash  dividends and purchase
shares of its outstanding stock. See also "Management's  Discussion and Analysis
of Results of  Operations  and  Financial  Condition  -  Liquidity  and  Capital
Resources - Liquidity" and note "21 - Regulatory  Requirements"  in the Notes to

Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of

     The decrease in interest revenue, net of interest expense,  from the fourth
quarter of 2001 to the fourth  quarter of 2002 was primarily due to lower levels
of, and lower rates received on, margin loans to clients, as well as lower rates
received on client-related investments,  partially offset by lower rates paid on
brokerage  client cash balances and higher  average  balances of  client-related
investments.

                  Condensed Financial Information of Registrant
                    Notes to Condensed Financial Information



1.   Introduction and Basis of Presentation

     The condensed financial information of The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC)
     should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of
     The  Charles  Schwab  Corporation  and  its   majority-owned   subsidiaries
     (collectively referred to as the Company) and notes thereto included in the
     Company's 2002 Annual Report to Stockholders,  which is incorporated herein
     by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.

     On May 31, 2000,  CSC  completed  its merger (the  Merger) with U.S.  Trust
     Corporation  (USTC). The condensed financial  statements,  included in this
     Annual Report on Form 10-K, give  retroactive  effect to the Merger,  which
     was accounted for as a pooling of interests in the  consolidated  financial
     statements.  The pooling of  interests  method of  accounting  requires the
     restatement of all periods  presented as if CSC and USTC had been operating
     as a combined entity during such periods.

2.   Supplemental Cash Flow Information

     During 2000, CSC recorded a non-cash capital contribution of $19 million to
     its  subsidiary,   Charles  Schwab  &  Co.,  Inc.  (Schwab),   through  the
     contribution  of net assets.  Also  during  2000,  CSC  recorded a non-cash
     return of  capital  of $82  million  from  Schwab  and a  non-cash  capital
     contribution of $82 million to USTC in connection with Schwab's purchase of
     rights to software from USTC.

     Certain of CSC's  subsidiaries  have  remitted the tax benefits  from stock
     options exercised and other stock-based compensation of $4 million in 2002,
     $37 million in 2001 and $178 million in 2000 to CSC.

3.   Long-term Debt

     Long-term debt consists of Senior Medium-Term Notes,  Series A (Medium-Term
     Notes).  At December 31, 2002,  CSC had $566  million  aggregate  principal
     amount of Medium-Term Notes  outstanding with maturities  ranging from 2003
     to 2010 and fixed interest  rates ranging from 6.04% to 8.05%.  At December
     31, 2002, the Medium-Term Notes carried a weighted-average interest rate of
     7.29%.  During 2002, CSC entered into interest rate swap agreements (Swaps)
     with  an  aggregate   notional   principal  amount  of  $293  million  that
     effectively  convert the interest rate  characteristics of a like amount of
     its  Medium-Term  Notes from fixed to variable.  These Swaps are structured
     for CSC to receive a fixed  rate of  interest  and pay a  variable  rate of
     interest based on the three-month LIBOR rate. At December 31, 2002, the net
     effect of the Swaps converted the hedged portion of the  Medium-Term  Notes
     from a weighted-average  fixed interest rate of 7.57% to a weighted-average
     variable  interest rate of 3.87%.  These Swaps have been designated as fair
     value hedges under Statement of Financial

                                      F-6

     Accounting  Standards No. 133 - Accounting for Derivative  Instruments  and
     Hedging  Activities,  and are  recorded  on the  condensed  balance  sheet.
     Changes in fair value of the Swaps are completely offset by changes in fair
     value of the hedged Medium-Term Notes. At December 31, 2002, CSC recorded a
     derivative asset of $26 million for these Swaps. Concurrently, the carrying
     value of the Medium-Term Notes was increased by $26 million.

     At December 31, 2001, CSC had $679 million  aggregate  principal  amount of
     Medium-Term Notes outstanding with maturities ranging from 2002 to 2010 and
     fixed interest rates ranging from 6.04% to 8.05%. At December 31, 2001, the
     Medium-Term Notes carried a weighted-average interest rate of 7.27%.

     Annual maturities on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 are as
     follows (in millions):

     CSC provides  subordinated  revolving  credit  facilities and other lending

     Capital  Markets L.P.  (SCM) and Charles  Schwab Europe  (CSE).  The amount
     outstanding under these facilities and arrangements totaled $331 million at

     Schwab has a $1.4 billion  subordinated  revolving credit facility which is
     scheduled to expire in September  2003. The amount  outstanding  under this
     facility was $220 million at both  December 31, 2002 and 2001.  At year end

     these facilities at December 31, 2002 was $50 million.  No funds were drawn

     million, equivalent to $73 million, subordinated lending arrangement, which
     was not used as of that date.

     CSC  also   provides   other  lending   arrangements   to  certain  of  its
     subsidiaries.  At December 31, 2002, the total amount  provided under these
     lending  arrangements was $28 million,  of which $1 million was outstanding

     In 2002, two of CSC's subsidiaries  established revolving credit facilities
     for CSC which are scheduled to expire in 2005.  The total amount  available
     to CSC under these  borrowing  arrangements  was $28 million,  of which $24
     million was outstanding at December 31, 2002.

5.   Commitments and Guarantees

     During 2001, a subsidiary of CSC began  occupying and making lease payments
     on a newly  renovated  office  building in San Francisco,  California.  The
     lease for the  building  was  arranged by working  with a bank to create an
     unconsolidated  special purpose trust (Trust). The Trust, through an agent,
     raised the $245  million  needed to acquire and  renovate  the  building by
     issuing  long-term  debt ($235  million)  and raising  equity  capital ($10
     million).   The  subsidiary's   lease  payments  to  the  Trust  vary  with
     fluctuations  in interest rates and are structured to cover the interest on
     the debt  obligations and a specified  return on the equity (defined in the
     Trust  Agreement as 1.75% above the one-month  LIBOR rate).  This financing
     arrangement is known as a synthetic lease. Upon the expiration of the lease
     in June 2005,  the  subsidiary  may renew the lease for an additional  five
     years subject to certain approvals and conditions, or arrange a sale of the
     office  building to a third  party.  The  subsidiary  also has an option to
     purchase  the office  building  for $245 million at any time after June 18,
     2003.  CSC has provided the Trust with a residual  value  guarantee,  which
     means that if the building is sold to a third party, CSC is responsible for
     making up any shortfall between the actual sales price and the $245 million
     funded by the Trust, up to a maximum of $202 million.  Faced with continued
     declines in the San Francisco,  California  commercial  real estate market,
     CSC obtained  appraisals in the first and fourth  quarters of 2002 in order
     to estimate its  obligations  under the residual  value  guarantee.  On the
     basis of these  appraisals,  CSC  determined  that it was probable that the
     fair value of the  property at the end of the lease term would be less than
     the residual value guaranteed by approximately $98 million.  This shortfall
     is being amortized as additional rent expense on a straight-line basis over
     the  initial  lease term which  ends in June 2005.  Effective  in the first
     quarter of 2003,  the  subsidiary  plans to cease  amortizing the shortfall
     upon adoption of Financial  Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN)
     No. 46 - Consolidation  of Variable  Interest  Entities.  See FIN No. 46 in
     note "2 -  Significant  Accounting  Policies" in the Notes to  Consolidated
     Financial  Statements in the Company's 2002 Annual Report to  Stockholders,
     which is  incorporated  herein by  reference  to Exhibit  No.  13.1 of this
     report.

     CSC has  provided  certain  indemnification  agreements  (i.e.,  protection
     against  damage  or  loss)  to   counterparties   in  connection  with  the
     disposition  of  certain of the  Company's  assets.  Such  indemnifications
     relate to employee terminations,  ownership of intellectual property rights
     (e.g., patents), accuracy of financial statements, compliance with laws and
     regulations,  and  misrepresentations.   At  December  31,  2002,  CSC  had
     indemnification  agreements  with  various  expiration  dates and a maximum
     potential liability of approximately $70 million. CSC does not believe that
     any material loss related to such  indemnifications is likely and therefore
     no liability has been recognized.
