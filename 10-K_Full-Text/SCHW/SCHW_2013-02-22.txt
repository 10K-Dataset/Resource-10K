THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Annual Report On Form 10-K

For Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2012



THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

PART I

Item 1.

Business

General Corporate Overview

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC), headquartered in San Francisco, California, was incorporated in 1986 and engages, through its
subsidiaries (together referred to as the Company, and primarily located in San Francisco except as indicated), in securities brokerage, banking, money management, and financial advisory services. At December 31, 2012, the Company had
$1.95 trillion in client assets, 8.8 million active brokerage accounts

(a)

, 1.6 million corporate retirement plan participants, and 865,000 banking accounts.

Significant business subsidiaries of CSC include:

•

Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (Schwab), which was incorporated in 1971, is a securities broker-dealer with over 300 domestic branch offices in 45
states, as well as a branch in each of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and London, U.K., and serves clients in Hong Kong through one of CSC’s subsidiaries;

•

Charles Schwab Bank (Schwab Bank), which commenced operations in 2003, is a federal savings bank located in Reno, Nevada; and

•

Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), which is the investment advisor for Schwab’s proprietary mutual funds, referred to as the
Schwab Funds

®

, and Schwab’s exchange-traded funds, referred to as the Schwab ETFs™.

The Company provides financial services to
individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Institutional Services. The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors. The Institutional Services segment
provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors (IAs). The Institutional Services segment also provides retirement plan services, specialty brokerage services, and mutual fund clearing services. For financial
information by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2012, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 25. Segment Information.”

As of December 31, 2012, the Company had full-time, part-time and
temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis that represented the equivalent of about 13,800 full-time employees.

Business Acquisitions

On December 14, 2012, the Company acquired ThomasPartners, Inc., a growth and dividend income-focused asset management firm.

In September 2011, the Company acquired
optionsXpress Holdings, Inc. (optionsXpress), an online brokerage firm primarily focused on equity option securities and futures. The optionsXpress

®

brokerage platform provides active investors and traders trading tools, analytics and education to execute a variety of investment strategies. optionsXpress, Inc., a
wholly-owned subsidiary of optionsXpress, is a securities broker-dealer.

In November 2010, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Windward Investment Management, Inc. (Windward), an investment advisory firm that managed diversified investment portfolios
comprised primarily of exchange-traded fund securities. As a result of the acquisition, Windhaven Investment Management, Inc. (Windhaven) was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schwab Holdings, Inc.

Business Strategy and Competitive Environment

The Company’s purpose is to champion every
client’s goals with passion and integrity, believing that the best long-term strategy is one that puts clients first. Seeing the Company’s business “through clients’ eyes” helps it earn its clients’ trust as

(a)

Accounts with balances or activity within the preceding eight months.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

the Company strives daily to fulfill its purpose and act according to its values. The Company’s values are to serve its clients in an ethical, empathetic and proactive way; to innovate
constantly to improve the client experience; to respect fellow employees and reinforce the power of teamwork; and to be good stewards of the resources entrusted to the Company – client assets, the Company’s brand, and stockholder value.

The Company’s competition in serving individual investors
includes a wide range of brokerage, wealth management, and asset management firms, as well as banks and trust companies. In serving these investors and competing for a growing percentage of the investable wealth in the U.S., the Company offers a
multi-channel service delivery model, which includes online, mobile, telephonic, and branch capabilities. Under this model, the Company can offer personalized service at competitive prices while giving clients the choice of where, when, and how they
do business with the Company. Schwab’s branches and regional telephone service centers are staffed with trained and experienced financial consultants (FCs) focused on building and sustaining client relationships. The Company offers the ability
to meet client investing needs through a single ongoing point of contact, even as those needs change over time. In particular, management believes that the Company’s ability to provide those clients seeking help, guidance, or advice with an
integrated, individually tailored solution – ranging from occasional consultations to an ongoing relationship with a Schwab FC or an IA – is a competitive strength compared to the more fragmented offerings of other firms.

The Company’s online, mobile, and telephonic channels provide quick and
efficient access to an extensive array of information, research, tools, trade execution, and administrative services, which clients can access according to their needs. For example, clients that trade more actively can use these channels to access
highly competitive pricing, expert tools, and extensive service capabilities – including experienced, knowledgeable teams of trading specialists and integrated product offerings. Individuals investing for retirement through 401(k) plans
can take advantage of the Company’s bundled offering of multiple investment choices, education, and third-party advice. Management also believes the Company is able to compete with the wide variety of financial services firms striving to
attract individual client relationships by complementing these capabilities with the extensive array of investment, banking, and lending products and services described in the following section.

In the IA arena, the Company competes with institutional custodians,
traditional and discount brokers, banks, investment advisory firms, and trust companies. Management believes that its Institutional Services segment can maintain its market leadership position primarily through the efforts of its expanded sales and
support teams, which are dedicated to helping IAs grow, compete, and succeed in serving their clients. In addition to focusing on superior service, Institutional Services competes by utilizing technology to provide IAs with a highly-developed,
scalable platform for administering their clients’ assets easily and efficiently. Institutional Services sponsors a variety of national, regional, and local events designed to help IAs identify and implement better ways to grow and manage their
practices efficiently.

Another important
aspect of the Company’s ability to compete is its ongoing focus on efficiency and productivity, as lower costs give the Company greater flexibility in its approach to pricing and investing for growth. Management believes that this flexibility
remains important in light of the competitive environment, in which a number of competitors offer reduced online trading commission rates and low expense ratios on certain classes of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Additionally, the
Company’s nationwide marketing effort is an important competitive tool because it reinforces the attributes of the
Schwab

®

brand.

Products and Services

The Company offers a broad range of products to address individuals’ varying investment and financial needs. Examples of these product offerings
include:

•

Brokerage – an array of brokerage accounts including some with check-writing features, debit card, and billpay; individual retirement accounts;

®

, including no-load mutual funds through the Mutual Fund OneSource

®

service, proprietary mutual funds from two fund families – Schwab Funds

®

and Laudus Funds

®

third-party mutual funds, and mutual fund trading and clearing services to broker-dealers;

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

•

Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) – third-party and proprietary ETFs, including Schwab ETFs™, and separately managed portfolios of ETFs;

•

Advice solutions – separately managed accounts, customized personal advice for tailored portfolios, and specialized planning and full-time
portfolio management;

•

Banking – checking accounts linked to brokerage accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, demand deposit accounts, first lien
residential real estate mortgage loans (First Mortgages), home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), personal loans collateralized by securities, and entity lending; and

•

Trust – trust custody services, personal trust reporting services, and administrative trustee services.

These products, and the Company’s full array of investing services, are
made available through its two segments – Investor Services and Institutional Services. The Company’s major sources of revenues are generated by both of the Company’s reportable segments. Revenue is attributable to a reportable
segment based on which segment has the primary responsibility for serving the client. The accounting policies of the Company’s reportable segments are the same as those described in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Investor Services

Through the Investor Services segment, the Company provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors.

The Company offers research, analytic tools, performance reports, market
analysis, and educational material to all clients. Clients looking for more guidance have access to online portfolio planning tools, professional advice from Schwab’s portfolio consultants who can help develop an investment strategy and carry
out investment and portfolio management decisions, as well as a range of fully delegated managed solutions that provide ongoing portfolio management.

Schwab strives to demystify investing by educating and assisting clients in the development of investment plans. Educational tools
include workshops, interactive courses, and online information about investing, which Schwab does not earn revenue from. Additionally, Schwab provides various internet-based research and analysis tools that are designed to help clients achieve
better investment outcomes. As an example of such tools, Schwab Equity Ratings

®

is a quantitative model-based
stock rating system that provides all clients with ratings on approximately 3,000 stocks, assigning each equity a single grade: A, B, C, D, or F. Schwab Equity Ratings International

TM

, an international ranking methodology, covers approximately 4,000 stocks in 28 foreign equity markets. Stocks are
rated based on specific factors relating to fundamentals, valuation, momentum, and risk and ranked so that the number of ‘buy consideration’ ratings – As and Bs – equals the number of ‘sell consideration’ ratings –
Ds and Fs.

Clients may need specific investment recommendations,
either from time to time or on an ongoing basis. The Company provides clients seeking advice with customized solutions. The Company’s approach to advice is based on long-term investment strategies and guidance on portfolio diversification and
asset allocation. This approach is designed to be offered consistently across all of Schwab’s delivery channels.

Schwab Private Client

TM

features a personal advice relationship with a designated portfolio consultant, supported by a team of investment
professionals who provide individualized service, a customized investment strategy developed in collaboration with the client, and ongoing guidance and execution.

For clients seeking a relationship in which investment
decisions are fully delegated to a financial professional, the Company offers several alternatives. The Company provides investors access to professional investment management in a diversified account that is invested exclusively in either mutual
funds or ETFs through the Schwab Managed Portfolios

TM

and
Windhaven

®

programs. The Company also refers investors who want to utilize a specific third-party money manager
to direct a portion of their investment assets to the Schwab Managed Account program. In addition, clients who want the assistance of an independent professional in managing their financial affairs may be referred to IAs in the Schwab Advisor
Network

®

. These IAs provide personalized portfolio management, financial planning, and wealth management
solutions.

The Company strives to deliver information, education,
technology, service, and pricing that meet the specific needs of clients who trade actively. Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. both offer integrated Web- and software-based trading platforms, which

- 3 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

incorporate intelligent order routing technology, real-time market data, options trading, premium stock or futures research, and multi-channel access, as well as sophisticated account and trade
management features, risk management tools, decision support tools, and dedicated personal support.

For clients wishing to invest in foreign
equities, the Company offers a suite of global investing capabilities, including on-line access to certain foreign equity markets with the ability to trade in their local currencies. In addition, the Company serves both foreign investors and
non-English-speaking U.S. clients who wish to trade or invest in U.S. dollar-based securities. In the U.S., the Company serves Chinese-, Spanish-, and Vietnamese-speaking clients through a combination of its branch offices and Web-based and
telephonic services.

Institutional Services

The Institutional Services segment consists of the following four business units: Advisor Services, Retirement Plan Services, Retirement Business Services, and Corporate Brokerage Services.

Through the Advisor Services business, Schwab provides custodial, trading, technology, practice management, trust asset, and other support services to
IAs. To attract and serve IAs, Advisor Services has a dedicated sales force and service teams assigned to meet their needs.

IAs who custody
client accounts at Schwab may use proprietary software that provides them with up-to-date client account information, as well as trading capabilities. The Advisor Services website is the core platform for IAs to conduct daily business activities
online with Schwab, including submitting client account information and retrieving news and market information. This platform provides IAs with a comprehensive suite of electronic and paper-based reporting capabilities. Advisor Services offers
online cashiering services, as well as internet-based eDocuments sites for both IAs and their clients that provide multi-year archiving of online statements, trade confirms and tax reports, along with document search capabilities.

To help IAs grow and manage their practices, Advisor Services offers a variety of services, including marketing and business development, business

®

conference, which provides a national forum for the Company, IAs, and other industry participants to gather and
share information and insights.

employee personal trading, including trade surveillance technology. The Corporate Brokerage Services unit also provides mutual fund clearing services to banks, brokerage firms and trust companies and offers proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, collective
trust funds, and investment management outside the Company to institutional channels.

Subsequent Changes to Segment Information

In the first quarter of 2013, the Company realigned its reportable segments as a result of recent organizational changes. The Institutional segment will be renamed to Advisor Services. The Retirement Plan
Services, Corporate Brokerage Retirement Products (formerly part of Retirement Business Services), and Corporate Brokerage Services business units will be reallocated to the Investor Services segment. The Company will recast the segment information
based on this realignment in the first quarter of 2013.

Regulation

CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution subsidiary, is a federal savings bank. CSC is subject to
supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) and Schwab Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). CSC is currently not subject to
specific statutory capital requirements, however CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank. Under the “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act” (the Dodd-Frank Act), CSC will be subject to new
minimum leverage and minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements that will be set by the Federal Reserve that are at least as stringent as the current requirements generally applicable to insured depository institutions.

Schwab Bank is subject to regulation and supervision and to various
requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws, including regulatory capital guidelines. Among other things, these requirements also restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions, such as extensions of credit and repayment of
loans between Schwab Bank and CSC or CSC’s other subsidiaries. In addition, Schwab Bank is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. The federal banking
agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance
Act, Schwab Bank could be subject to restrictive actions if it were to fall within one of the lowest three of five capital categories. Schwab Bank is required to maintain minimum capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations.
Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Schwab Bank.

The securities industry in the United States is subject to extensive
regulation under both federal and state laws. CSC’s principal U.S. broker-dealers are Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. Schwab is registered as a broker-dealer with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fifty states, and
the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.

- 5 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

optionsXpress, Inc. is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC, the fifty states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Schwab and CSIM are registered as investment
advisors with the SEC. Additionally, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. are regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with respect to the commodity futures and commodities trading activities they conduct as an introducing broker and
futures commission merchant, respectively.

Much of the regulation
of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations (SROs). Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), NYSE Arca, and
the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). optionsXpress, Inc. is also a member of other exchanges. The primary regulators of Schwab are FINRA and, for municipal securities, the MSRB. The primary regulators of optionsXpress, Inc. are FINRA, CBOE,
and for municipal securities, the MSRB. The National Futures Association (NFA) is Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc.’s primary regulator for futures and commodities trading activities. The Company’s business is also subject to oversight by
regulatory bodies in other countries in which the Company operates.

The principal purpose of regulating broker-dealers and investment advisors is the protection of clients and the securities markets. The regulations to
which broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales and trading practices, publication of research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds
and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements, disclosure to clients, fiduciary duties owed to advisory clients, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.

Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. are both subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule) and related SRO requirements. The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Uniform Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the
general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. Because CSC itself is not a registered broker-dealer, it is not subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule. However, if Schwab fails to maintain specified levels of net capital, such failure
would constitute a default by CSC under debt covenants under CSC’s credit agreement.

The Uniform Net Capital Rule limits broker-dealers’ ability to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Compliance with the Uniform Net Capital Rule could limit Schwab’s
operations and its ability to repay subordinated debt to CSC, which in turn could limit CSC’s ability to repay debt, pay cash dividends, and purchase shares of its outstanding stock.

Sources of Net Revenues

The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and
administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based advisory solutions. Net interest
revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as cash, short- and long-term investments, and mortgage and margin loans) and interest paid on funding sources (including banking deposits and client cash in
brokerage accounts and long-term debt). The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities.

For revenue information by source for the three years ended
December 31, 2012, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Net Revenues.”

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The Company faces a variety
of risks that may affect its operations or financial results, and many of those risks are driven by factors that the Company cannot control or predict. The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most significant,
although there may be other risks that could arise, or may prove to be more significant than expected, that may affect the Company’s operations or financial results.

For a discussion of the Company’s risk management, including operational risk, credit risk, and market risk, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations – Risk Management.”

Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could
negatively impact the Company’s business.

The Company’s business can be adversely affected by the general environment –
economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates and overall investor engagement, and are outside of the Company’s control.
Deterioration in the housing and credit markets, reductions in short-term interest rates, and decreases in securities valuations negatively impact the Company’s net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and capital
resources.

A significant decrease in the Company’s liquidity could negatively affect the Company’s business and financial
management as well as reduce client confidence in the Company.

Maintaining adequate liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the
Company, including margin lending, mortgage lending, and transaction settlement, among other liquidity needs. The Company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by client activity and operating earnings, as well as cash provided
by external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as changes in market conditions, may affect the Company’s ability to meet its liquidity needs. A reduction in the Company’s liquidity position could reduce
client confidence in the Company, which could result in the loss of client accounts. In addition, if the Company’s broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the
subsidiaries’ operations or their ability to upstream funds to CSC, which could reduce CSC’s liquidity and adversely affect its ability to repay debt and pay cash dividends. In addition, CSC may need to provide additional funding to such
subsidiaries.

Factors which may adversely affect the Company’s liquidity position include a reduction in cash held in banking or
brokerage client accounts, a dramatic increase in the Company’s client lending activities (including margin and personal lending), unanticipated outflows of company cash, increased capital requirements, other regulatory changes or a loss of
market or customer confidence in the Company. Schwab may also experience temporary liquidity demands due to timing differences between clients’ transaction settlements and the availability of segregated cash balances.

When cash generated by client activity and operating earnings is not sufficient for the Company’s liquidity needs, the Company must seek external
financing. During periods of disruptions in the credit and capital markets, potential sources of external financing could be reduced, and borrowing costs could increase. Although CSC and Schwab maintain committed and uncommitted, unsecured bank
credit lines and CSC has a commercial paper issuance program, as well as a universal shelf registration statement filed with the SEC, financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all due to market conditions or disruptions in the credit
markets. In addition, a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.

- 7 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

The Company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures.

The Company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client,
counterparty or issuer will fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to manage this risk, the policies
and procedures may not be fully effective. The Company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing
activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the Company sponsors.

When clients purchase securities on margin, the Company is subject to the risk that clients may default on their obligations when the value of the
securities held as collateral falls below the amount of clients’ indebtedness. Abrupt changes in securities valuations and the failure of clients to meet margin calls could result in substantial losses.

The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities
available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios, which include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, consumer loan asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency notes, and
commercial paper among other investments. These instruments are also subject to price fluctuations as a result of changes in the financial market’s assessment of issuer credit quality, increases in the unemployment rate, delinquency and default
rates, housing price declines, changes in prevailing interest rates and other economic factors.

Loss of value of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity can negatively affect earnings if management determines that such securities are other than temporarily impaired. The
evaluation of whether other-than-temporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment, which includes the assessment of several factors. See “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates.” If management determines that a security is other-than-temporarily impaired, the cost basis of the security may be adjusted and a corresponding loss may be recognized in current earnings.
Certain securities available for sale experienced continued credit deterioration in 2012, which resulted in impairment charges. Deterioration in the performance of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity could result in the
recognition of future impairment charges.

The Company’s
loans to banking clients primarily consist of First Mortgages and HELOCs. Increases in delinquency and default rates, housing price declines, increases in the unemployment rate, and other economic factors can result in charges for loan loss reserves
and write downs on such loans.

Heightened credit exposures to
specific counterparties or instruments (concentration risk) can increase the Company’s risk of loss. Examples of the Company’s credit concentration risk include:

•

large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or
industry;

•

mortgage loans and HELOCs to banking clients which are secured by properties in the same geographic region; and

•

margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry.

The Company may also be subject to
concentration risk when lending to a particular counterparty, borrower or issuer.

The Company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although the Company has no obligation to do so, the Company may decide for competitive or other reasons
to provide credit, liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such support could cause the Company to take
significant charges, could reduce the Company’s liquidity and, in certain situations, could, with respect to proprietary funds other than money market mutual funds, result in the Company having to consolidate a supported fund in its financial
statements. If the Company chose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, the Company could suffer reputational damage and its business could be adversely affected.

Significant interest rate changes could affect the Company’s profitability and financial
condition.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk
primarily from changes in the interest rates on its interest-earning assets (such as cash equivalents, short- and long-term investments, and mortgage and margin loans) relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources (including deposits in
banking and brokerage accounts, short-term borrowings, and long-term debt). Changes in interest rates generally affect the interest earned on interest-earning assets differently than the interest the Company pays on its interest-bearing liabilities.
In addition, certain funding sources do not bear interest and their cost therefore does not vary. Overall, the Company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment; the Company could be adversely affected by a decline in interest
rates if the rates that the Company earns on interest-earning assets decline more than the rates that the Company pays on its funding sources, or if prepayment rates increase on the mortgages and mortgage-backed securities that the Company holds.
With the low interest rate environment, the Company’s yield on interest-earning assets has been declining more than the average rate that the Company pays on its funding sources. The Company may also be limited in the amount it can reduce
interest rates on deposit accounts and still offer a competitive return.

To the extent the overall yield on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds, the Company may waive a portion of its fee in order
to continue providing some return to clients. As a result of the low interest rate environment, the Company has been waiving and may continue to waive a portion of its management fees for certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds. Such fee
waivers negatively impact the Company’s asset management and administration fees.

The Company is subject to litigation and regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending itself against claims or proceedings.

The financial services industry faces substantial litigation and regulatory
risks. The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject
of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.

Litigation and arbitration claims include those brought by the Company’s clients and the clients of third party advisors whose assets are custodied at the Company. Claims from clients of third party
advisors may allege losses due to investment decisions made by the third party advisors or the advisors’ misconduct. Litigation claims also include claims from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g.,
patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant Company resources. If the Company were found to have infringed a third-party patent, or other intellectual property rights, it could incur substantial damages, and in some
circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.

Actions brought against the Company may result in settlements, awards, injunctions, fines, penalties or other results adverse to the Company including reputational harm. Even if the Company is successful
in defending against these actions, the defense of such matters may result in the Company incurring significant expenses. Predicting the outcome of matters is inherently difficult, particularly where claims are brought on behalf of various classes
of claimants, claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages, or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage. A substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to the Company’s operating results or
cash flows for a particular future period, depending on the Company’s results for that period. In market downturns, the volume of legal claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services
companies have historically increased. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 15. Commitments and Contingencies.”

Extensive regulation of the Company’s businesses limits the
Company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties.

As a participant in the securities, banking and financial services industries, the Company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies, supervisory
authorities, and SROs. Such regulation becomes more extensive and complex in response to market disruptions. The requirements imposed by the Company’s regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets, the safety and
soundness of financial institutions, and the protection of clients. These regulations often serve to limit the Company’s activities by way of capital, customer protection and market

- 9 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

conduct requirements, and restrictions on the businesses activities that the Company may conduct. Despite the Company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations, there are a number of
risks, particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where regulators revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the Company’s regulators against the Company or its affiliates,
officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders, enforcement actions, suspension or expulsion, or other disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities, any of which could harm
the Company’s reputation and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the Company’s business and financial results.

New legislation, rule changes, or changes in the interpretation or
enforcement of existing federal, state and SRO rules and regulations, including changes relating to money market mutual funds, broker-dealer fiduciary duties and mortgage products and services, may directly affect the operation and profitability of
the Company or its specific business lines. The profitability of the Company could also be affected by rules and regulations which impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic
commerce, client privacy and security of client data. In addition, the rules and regulations could result in limitations on the lines of business the Company conducts, modifications to the Company’s business practices, increased capital
requirements, or additional costs.

Financial reforms and
related regulations may affect the Company’s business activities, financial position and profitability.

The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010 and implementation is ongoing. This legislation makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and significant rule-making and
interpretation remains. In addition, the legislation mandates multiple studies, which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action. Among other things, the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees and requires the
establishment of minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for insured depository institutions, and requires the SEC to complete studies and develop rules regarding various investor protection issues. The legislation also charges the
Federal Reserve with drafting enhanced regulatory requirements for non-bank financial institutions designated as “systemically important.” CSC has not been designated as “systemically important,” but could be designated in the
future. The legislation also eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) effective July 21, 2011 and, as a result, the Federal Reserve became CSC’s primary regulator and the OCC became the primary regulator of Schwab Bank. CSC is
continuing to review the impact the legislation, studies and related rule-making will have on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

In 2012, the Federal Reserve issued notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRs) to
meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and to align current capital rules with the BASEL III capital standards. The NPRs would subject all savings and loan holding companies, including CSC, to consolidated capital requirements. In addition,
the NPRs would establish more restrictive capital definitions, higher risk-weightings for certain asset classes, higher minimum capital ratios and capital buffers. The Company expects the capital standard rules to be phased in under an extended
timeframe after adoption. The comment period for the NPRs ended on October 22, 2012 and the NPRs are subject to further modification. CSC continues to monitor developments in order to assess the impact of the NPRs but does not expect them to
have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The legislation also established a new independent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement authority over consumer products, including mortgages,
home-equity loans and credit cards. States will be permitted to adopt stricter consumer protection laws and state attorney generals can enforce consumer protection rules issued by the Bureau. These rules may negatively impact the range of products
offered and profitability of our loan products.

The legislation
gives the SEC discretion to adopt rules regarding standards of conduct for broker-dealers providing investment advice to retail customers. The various studies required by the legislation could result in additional rulemaking or legislative action,
which could impact the Company’s business and financial results.

The changes resulting from the legislation may impact the profitability of the Company’s business activities, require changes to certain of its business practices, impose upon the Company more
stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

or otherwise adversely affect the Company’s business. These changes may also require the Company to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary
changes.

Technology and operational failures or errors could
subject the Company to losses, litigation, and regulatory actions.

The Company faces operational risk, which is the potential for loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, and firms or exchanges handling client orders, or from external events and
relationships impacting the Company and/or any of its key business partners and vendors. This risk also includes the risk of human error, execution errors, employee misconduct, unauthorized trading, external fraud, computer viruses, distributed
denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, natural disaster, capacity constraints and software flaws. It could take several hours or more to restore full functionality to the Company’s technology or other operating systems in the event of an
unforeseen event which could affect the Company’s ability to process and settle client transactions. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct, including improper use or disclosure of confidential client, employee, or company
information, might also negatively impact the Company’s reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. Despite the Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk,
oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage these risks, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses, reputational damage or regulatory action due to technology
or other operational failures or errors, including those of its vendors or other third parties.

While the Company devotes substantial attention and resources to the reliability, capacity and scalability of its systems, extraordinary trading volumes could cause the Company’s computer systems to
operate at unacceptably slow speeds or even fail, affecting the Company’s ability to process client transactions and potentially resulting in some clients’ orders being executed at prices they did not anticipate. Disruptions in service and
slower system response times could result in substantial losses and decreased client satisfaction. The Company is also dependent on the integrity and performance of securities exchanges, clearing houses and other intermediaries to which client
orders are routed for execution and settlement. Systems failures and constraints and transaction error at such intermediaries could result in delays and erroneous or unanticipated execution prices, cause substantial losses for the Company and for
its clients, and subject the Company to claims from its clients for damages.

The Company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.

The Company relies on external service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. These service providers
face technology, operating, business, and economic risks, and any significant failures by them, including the improper use or disclosure of the Company’s confidential client, employee, or company information, could cause the Company to incur
losses and could harm the Company’s reputation. An interruption in or the cessation of service by any external service provider as a result of systems failures, capacity constraints, financial difficulties or for any other reason, and the
Company’s inability to make alternative arrangements in a timely manner could disrupt the Company’s operations, impact the Company’s ability to offer certain products and services, and result in financial losses to the Company.
Switching to an alternative service provider may require a transition period and result in less efficient operations.

Security breaches of the Company’s systems, or those of its clients or third parties, may subject the Company to significant liability and damage
the Company’s reputation.

The Company’s business
involves the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential information about the Company and its clients. Information security risks for financial institutions are increasing, in part because of the use of the internet and mobile
technologies to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, activists, hackers and other external parties. The Company’s systems and those of other financial institutions have been and are
likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account
takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. Despite the Company’s efforts to ensure the integrity of its systems, the Company may not be able to anticipate or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of
these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because security attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. Data security breaches may also result from non-technical means,
for example, actions by a suborned employee.

- 11 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Security breaches,
including breaches of the Company’s security measures or those of the Company’s third-party service providers or clients, could result in a violation of applicable privacy and other laws and could subject the Company to significant
liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by the Company’s regulators, damage to the Company’s reputation, or a loss of confidence in the Company’s security measures which could harm the Company’s business.
The Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.

The Company also faces risk related to external fraud involving the
compromise of clients’ personal electronic devices that can facilitate the unauthorized access to login and password information for their various online financial accounts, including those at the Company. Such risk has grown in recent years
due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime and other external parties. For example, these parties send fraudulent “phishing” emails to the Company’s clients in order to misappropriate user names, passwords
or other personal information. Losses reimbursed to clients under the Company’s guarantee against unauthorized account activity could have a negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact
on the Company’s financial position.

The Company
evaluates potential strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The
process of evaluating, negotiating, and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating
businesses and systems may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships
with clients and business partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. In addition, an acquisition may cause the Company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation. Further, the Company may not realize the
anticipated benefits from an acquisition, and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the Company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per common share.

The Company’s acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions, including regulatory approvals
and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold. To the extent the Company enters into an agreement to buy or sell an entity, there can be no guarantee that the
transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, the Company’s stock price could decline.

The Company’s industry is characterized by aggressive price competition.

The Company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and
periodically adjusts trade commission rates, interest rates on deposits and loans, fees for advisory services, and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position. Increased price competition from other financial services firms, such as
reduced commissions to attract trading volume or higher deposit rates to attract client cash balances, could impact the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The industry in which the Company competes has undergone a period of consolidation.

The Company faces intense competition for the clients that it serves and the
products and services it offers. There has been significant consolidation as financial institutions with which the Company competes have been acquired by or merged into or acquired other firms. This consolidation may continue. Competition is based
on many factors, including the range of products and services offered, pricing, customer service, brand recognition, reputation, and perceived financial strength. Consolidations may enable other firms to offer a broader range of products and
services than the Company does, or offer such products at more competitive prices.

The Company faces competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees, especially for employees who are key to the Company’s ability to build and enhance client relationships.

The market for quality professionals and other personnel in the
Company’s business is highly competitive. Competition is particularly strong for financial consultants who build and sustain the Company’s client relationships. The Company’s ability

- 12 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.

The Company’s stock price has fluctuated historically, and may
continue to fluctuate.

The Company’s stock price can be
volatile. Among the factors that may affect the volatility of the Company’s stock price are the following:

•

speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, the Company’s competitive position, organizational structure,
executive team, operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost reduction initiatives, or strategic transactions;

•

the announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by the Company or its competitors;

•

increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial
results and actual financial results.

Changes
in the stock market generally or as it concerns the Company’s industry, as well as geopolitical, economic, and business factors unrelated to the Company, may also affect the Company’s stock price.

Future sales of CSC’s equity securities may adversely affect the
market price of CSC’s common stock and result in dilution.

CSC’s certificate of incorporation authorizes CSC’s Board of Directors to, among other things, issue additional shares of common or preferred stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into
equity securities, without stockholder approval. CSC may issue additional equity or convertible securities to raise additional capital or for other purposes. The issuance of any additional equity or convertible securities could be substantially
dilutive to holders of CSC’s common stock and may adversely affect the market price of CSC’s common stock.

Item 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

Management of the Company focuses on several key client activity and
financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. Results for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010 are:

(1)

2012 includes inflows of $27.7 billion from mutual fund clearing services clients and $900 million from the acquisition of ThomasPartners,
Inc., and outflows of $1.3 billion from the closure and/or sale of certain subsidiaries of optionsXpress Holdings, Inc. 2011 includes inflows of $56.1 billion from a mutual fund clearing services client and $7.5 billion from the
acquisition of optionsXpress. 2010 includes net outflows of $51.5 billion related to the planned deconversion of a mutual fund clearing services client.

(


)

2011 includes 315,000 new brokerage accounts from the acquisition of optionsXpress Holdings, Inc.

(


)

2012 includes the removal of approximately 19,000 accounts as a result of the sale of certain subsidiaries of optionsXpress and 30,000 accounts due to
escheatment and other factors.

(


)

Calculated as net income available to common stockholders divided by common stockholders’ equity.

•

Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this
metric depicts how well the Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients in a given operating environment. Core net new client assets is defined as net new client assets before significant one-time flows.

•

Client assets is the market value of all client assets custodied at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the
Company’s appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impact asset management and administration fees.

•

New brokerage accounts include all brokerage accounts opened during the period, as well as any accounts added via acquisition. This metric measures the
Company’s effectiveness in attracting new clients and building stronger relationships with existing clients.

•

Active brokerage accounts include accounts with balances or activity within the preceding eight months. This metric is an indicator of the
Company’s success in both attracting and retaining clients.

- 17 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

•

Management believes that earnings per common share, net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin, and return on common stockholders’ equity provide
broad indicators of the Company’s overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns within the context of a given operating environment.

•

Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Company’s broadest measure of productivity.

The Company’s major sources of net
revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based
advisory solutions. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities
valuations, interest rates, the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing funding sources, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenue through commissions
earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue primarily from trading activity in client fixed income securities. Trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income
markets, and commission rates.

2012 Compared to 2011

The broad equity markets improved during 2012 compared to
2011, as the Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 16%, 13%, and 7%, respectively. While the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, the
average three-month Treasury Bill yield increased by 4 basis points to 0.08% during 2012 compared to 2011. At the same time, the average 10-year Treasury yield decreased by 98 basis points to 1.78%.

Despite continuing economic and interest rate challenges during the year, the
Company’s sustained client focus helped deliver strong key client activity metrics in 2012. While net new client assets decreased slightly by 4% to $139.7 billion in 2012, core net new client assets totaled $112.4 billion, up 37% from
$82.3 billion in 2011. Total client assets ended the year at a record $1.95 trillion, up 16% from 2011. In addition, the Company added 900,000 new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2012, and active brokerage accounts reached a
record 8.8 million, up 3% from 2011.

Net revenues increased
by 4% in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue – net, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased
primarily due to increases in advice solutions fees and other asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of low overall
interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgage-backed securities. Other revenue – net increased primarily due to a pre-tax gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in the second
quarter of 2012. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades, partially offset by the inclusion of optionsXpress’ trading activity from its acquisition in September 2011.

Expenses excluding interest were higher by 4% in 2012 compared to 2011
primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ expenses. Taxes on income in 2012 include a non-recurring state tax benefit of $20 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012. Overall, growth in the Company’s client
base and ongoing expense discipline helped the Company increase net income by 7% in 2012 from 2011, and achieve a pre-tax profit margin of 29.7% and return on common stockholders’ equity of 11% in 2012.

2011 Compared to 2010

Economic and market conditions were challenging throughout 2011, marked by
volatility in the equity markets, lower market valuations, and further declines in interest rates. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, Nasdaq Composite Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased on average 6%, 5%, and 4%, respectively,
between the first and second halves of the year. The federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 0.25% and the average three-month Treasury Bill and average 10-year Treasury yields declined by 8 and 43 basis
points to 0.04% and 2.76%, respectively.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

The Company’s key client activity metrics in 2011 were stable in the midst of a weakened economic
and market environment. Net new client assets totaled $145.9 billion in 2011. Core net new client assets totaled $82.3 billion in 2011, up 5% from $78.1 billion in 2010. Total client assets ended the year at $1.68 trillion, up 7%
from 2010. In addition, the Company added 1.1 million new brokerage accounts to its client base during 2011 and ended the year serving 8.6 million active brokerage accounts.

Net revenues increased by 10% in 2011 from 2010 due to increases in all of the Company’s major sources of net revenues. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase
in advice solutions fees and continued asset inflows, partially offset by a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets during the year, partially
offset by the effect of lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgage-backed securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher
daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsXpress’ trading activity.

While total expenses excluding
interest were lower by 5% in 2011 compared to 2010, the Company experienced increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and advertising and market development expenses in aggregate of $266 million in
2011 compared to 2010. Significant charges in 2010 included class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund

, losses recognized for Schwab money market mutual funds, and a charge relating to the termination of the Company’s Invest First

®

and WorldPoints

(a)

Visa

(b)

credit card program for a total of $482 million.

As a result of the
Company’s ongoing investment in clients and sustained expense discipline, the Company achieved a pre-tax profit margin of 29.7% and return on common stockholders’ equity of 12% in 2011.

CURRENT MARKET AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS

As discussed above, interest rates remained at low levels during 2012. To the extent rates remain at these low levels, the Company’s net interest
revenue will continue to be constrained, even as growth in average balances helps to increase such revenue. The low interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees. While net money market mutual fund fees improved in
2012 from 2011 primarily due to sustained improvement in short-term interest rates, the overall yields on certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds. The Company
continues to waive a portion of its management fees so that the funds can maintain a positive return to clients. These and other money market mutual funds may not be able to replace maturing securities with securities of equal or higher yields. As a
result, the yields on such funds may remain around or decline from their current levels, and therefore below the management fees on those funds. To the extent this occurs, asset management and administration fees may be negatively affected.

The Company recorded net impairment losses of $32 million related to certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities in 2012
primarily due to further credit deterioration of the securities’ underlying loans. Further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio could result
in the recognition of additional impairment losses.

The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010. Among other things, the legislation
transferred the supervision and regulation of CSC from the OTS to the Federal Reserve and supervision and regulation of Schwab Bank from the OTS to the OCC; both transfers were effective July 21, 2011. In 2012, the Federal Reserve issued
notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRs) to meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act and to align current capital rules with the BASEL III capital standards. The NPRs would subject all savings and loan holding companies, including CSC, to
consolidated capital requirements. In

addition, the NPRs would establish more restrictive capital definitions, higher risk-weightings for certain asset classes, higher minimum capital ratios, and capital buffers. The Company expects
the capital standard rules to be phased in under an extended time frame after adoption. The comment period for the NPRs ended on October 22, 2012, and the NPRs are subject to further modification. CSC continues to monitor developments in order
to assess the impact of the NPRs but does not expect them to have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The Company is pursuing lawsuits in state court in San Francisco for
rescission and damages against issuers, underwriters, and dealers of individual non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities on which the Company has experienced realized and unrealized losses. The lawsuits allege that offering documents for
the securities contained material untrue and misleading statements about the securities and the underwriting standards and credit quality of the underlying loans. On January 27, 2012, and July 24, 2012, the court denied defendants’
motions to dismiss the claims with respect to all but 3 of the 51 securities, and discovery is proceeding.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The following discussion presents an analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010.

Net Revenues

The Company’s major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and
trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue increased, while trading revenue decreased in 2012 as compared to 2011. Asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue all
increased in 2011 as compared to 2010.

Asset Management and Administration Fees

Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and
institutional clients. The Company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These
fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions, which include advisory and managed account services that are based on the daily balances of client
assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Other asset management and administration fees
include various asset based fees, such as third-party mutual fund service fees, trust fees, 401k record keeping fees, and mutual fund clearing and other service fees. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of
client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.”

Asset management and administration fees increased by $115 million, or 6%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in advice
solutions fees and other asset management and administration fees. Asset management and administration fees increased by $106 million, or 6%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees, partially offset by a
decrease in mutual fund service fees.

Mutual fund service fees were relatively flat in 2012 from 2011, which reflected growth in client asset
balances invested in money market mutual funds, equity and bond funds, and Mutual Fund OneSource funds, offset by the effect of lower yields on certain mutual fund assets. Mutual fund service fees decreased by $59 million, or 5%, in 2011 from
2010 primarily due to a decrease in net money market mutual fund fees as a result of lower yields on fund assets, partially offset by higher Mutual Fund OneSource fees.

Advice solutions fees increased by $58 million, or 11%, in 2012 from 2011 and by $138 million, or 36%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to growth in client assets enrolled in retail advisory and
managed account programs, including Windhaven

and Schwab Managed Portfolios

TM

. The increase in advice solutions fees in 2011 from 2010 was also
due to temporary fees rebates of $63 million, which reduced advice solutions fees in 2010 under a rebate program that ended in 2010.

Other asset management and administration fees increased by $43 million, or 14%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in third-party
mutual fund service fees as a result of an increase in client asset balances invested in other third-party mutual funds.

Net Interest
Revenue

Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest-earning assets and interest paid on funding
sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company’s investment strategy is structured to
produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). When
interest rates fall, the Company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields, and by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities.
Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment
securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources. However, the spread is influenced by external
factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.”

The Company’s interest-earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and
deposits from banking clients. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include non-interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock-lending activities, as well as stockholders’equity.

In clearing their clients’ trades, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. hold cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab and optionsXpress,
Inc. pay their clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and in turn invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made to
clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to applicable regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of
clients, which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. must adhere to applicable regulations that restrict
investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, deposits held at U.S. banks and thrifts, and
resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. have established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments.

Schwab Bank maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funds from deposits in excess of loans to banking clients and liquidity
limits. Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale include mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency notes, commercial paper, and other securities. Schwab Bank’s
securities held to maturity include mortgage-backed and other securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans and HELOCs. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing deposits from banking
clients.

The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest-earning assets and funding sources on the
consolidated balance sheet:

(1)

Interest revenue was less than $500,000 in the period or periods presented.

(2)

Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost.

Net interest revenue increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, primarily securities available for sale, partially offset by the effect of low overall
interest rates and higher amortization of premiums

relating to mortgage-backed securities. Growth in the average deposit balances from banking clients funded the increase in the balance of securities available for sale.

Net interest revenue increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of
lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgage-backed securities. The growth in average balances of deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients funded the increases in
the balances of receivables from brokerage clients, securities available for sale, and securities held to maturity. Further declines in interest rates in 2011 accelerated the prepayment activity in the Company’s portfolio of residential
mortgage-backed securities, which resulted in higher premium amortization.

Trading Revenue

Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the
average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from trading activity in client fixed income securities. To accommodate clients’ fixed income trading activity, the Company maintains
positions in fixed income securities, including state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government, corporate debt, and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company buys and sells securities to and from its clients and
other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes unrealized gains and losses on these securities positions. Factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of
client trades and market price volatility.

Trading revenue decreased by $59 million, or 6%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to lower
daily average revenue trades, partially offset by the inclusion of optionsXpress’ trading activity for the full year. Trading revenue increased by $97 million, or 12%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades
and the addition of optionsXpress’ trading activity starting in September 2011.

Daily average revenue trades decreased by 7% in 2012
from 2011 primarily due to a lower volume of equity and mutual fund trades, partially offset by a higher volume of option and future trades as a result of the inclusion of optionsXpress. Daily average revenue trades increased by 12% in 2011 from
2010 primarily due to a higher volume of option, equity, and mutual fund trades. Average revenue per revenue trade remained relatively flat in 2012 and 2011.

Other Revenue – Net

Other
revenue – net includes nonrecurring gains and losses, realized gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, order flow revenue, software fees from the Company’s portfolio management services, exchange processing fees, and
other service fees.

Other revenue – net increased by $96 million, or 60%, in 2012 compared to 2011 primarily due to a pre-tax gain
of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in the second quarter of 2012. In November 2012, the

Company began receiving additional order flow rebates from market venues to which client orders are routed for execution. Order flow revenue increased by $23 million due to this revenue and
the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ order flow revenue. In December 2012, CSC redeemed the remaining outstanding portion of its 4.950% Senior Notes of $494 million that were due in 2014, which resulted in the payment of a
make-whole premium of $31 million that was recorded in other revenue – net. Other revenue – net also included realized gains of $35 million from the sales of securities available for sale.

Other revenue – net increased by $25 million, or 19%, in 2011
compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in software and exchange processing fees, as well as the addition of education services revenue from the acquisition of optionsXpress.

Provision for Loan Losses

The provision for loan losses was relatively flat in 2012 from 2011,
reflecting stable levels of delinquencies and nonaccrual loans experienced in 2012. The provision for loan losses decreased by $9 million, or 33%, in 2011 from 2010 due to a decrease in overall expected loss rates resulting primarily from
a decrease in first mortgage loan delinquencies. Charge-offs were $16 million, $19 million, and $20 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. For further discussion on the Company’s credit risk and the allowance for loan
losses, see “Risk Management – Credit Risk” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 7. Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Loan
Losses.”

Net Impairment Losses on Securities

Net impairment losses on securities were
$32 million, $31 million, and $36 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. These charges relate to certain non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, which experienced further credit deterioration of the securities’
underlying loans. For further discussion, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 6. Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity.”

Expenses Excluding Interest

As shown in the table below, expenses excluding interest were higher in 2012
compared to 2011, which was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ expenses and amortization of intangible assets relating to the optionsXpress acquisition. Expenses excluding interest were lower in 2011 compared to
2010 primarily due to certain significant charges in 2010, including class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and losses recognized for Schwab money market mutual funds. The decrease in expenses excluding
interest caused by these charges in 2010 was offset by increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and advertising and market development expenses in 2011.

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation includes variable compensation, discretionary
bonuses, and stock-based compensation. Variable compensation includes payments to certain individuals based on their sales performance. Discretionary bonuses are based on the Company’s overall performance as measured by earnings per common
share, and therefore will fluctuate with this measure. Stock-based compensation primarily includes employee and board of director stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards.

Compensation and benefits expense increased by $71 million, or 4%, in 2012 from 2011 due to increases in salaries and wages, incentive compensation
and employee benefits and other expense. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $159 million, or 10%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in salaries and wages and incentive compensation. The following table shows a comparison
of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data:

(1)

Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes employees of outsourced service
providers.

Salaries and wages increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in average full-time employees from
the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ employees. The increase in salaries and wages was partially offset by a decrease in persons employed on a contract basis. Incentive compensation increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to higher
variable compensation resulting from product sales performance in the Company’s branch offices. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in payroll taxes and the Company’s 401(k) plan
contribution expense due to increases in average full-time employees and incentive compensation, and an increase in the Company’s deferred compensation plan expense as a result of improvement in the broad equity markets.

Salaries and wages increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in full-time employees and persons employed on a contract basis. The increase
in full-time employees was partially due to the addition of full-time employees from the optionsXpress acquisition. Incentive compensation increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in discretionary bonuses and higher variable
compensation. Discretionary bonuses increased based on the Company’s overall performance in 2011, as well as an increase in full time employees. Variable compensation was higher primarily due to the integration of Windhaven, which was acquired
in November 2010. Employee benefits and other expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in payroll taxes and the Company’s 401(k) plan contribution expense as a result of increases in incentive compensation and full-time
employees.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits

Professional services expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in fees relating to the Company’s technology investments and
client facing infrastructure, and approximately $10 million in costs relating to the integration of optionsXpress.

Occupancy and
equipment expense increased in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to an increase in software maintenance expense relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an
increase in the Company’s investments in data processing equipment.

Advertising and market development expense increased in 2012 from
2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ expenses, which includes media, and the Company’s increased spending on customer promotions. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2011 from 2010
primarily due to higher spending on customer and branch promotions and electronic media.

Communications expense increased in 2011 from 2010
primarily due to higher telephone service expense and third-party news and information expense.

Depreciation and amortization expense
increased in 2012 and 2011 primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets relating to the optionsXpress acquisition. The increase in 2011 from 2010 was also due to the amortization of intangible assets resulting from the Windhaven
acquisition.

In 2011 and 2010, the Company recorded class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund.
For further discussion of the Schwab YieldPlus Fund litigation and regulatory matters, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 21. Class Action Litigation and
Regulatory Reserve and Money Market Mutual Fund Charges.”

In 2010, the Company decided to cover the net remaining losses of
$132 million recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008.

Other expense was lower in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to a charge of $30 million in 2010, relating to the Company’s former Invest First and WorldPoints Visa credit cards, as the Company
ended its sponsorship due to challenging credit card industry economics.

Taxes on Income

The Company’s effective income tax rate on income before taxes was 36.0% in 2012, 37.9% in 2011, and 41.7% in 2010. The decrease in 2012 from 2011
was primarily due to the recognition of a non-recurring state tax benefit of $20 million in the third quarter of 2012. The decrease in 2011 from 2010 was due to a lower effective state income tax rate in 2011 and the impact of non-deductible
penalties relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund regulatory settlements in 2010.

Segment Information

The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Investor Services and Institutional Services.
The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors. The Institutional Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors. The Institutional Services
segment also provides retirement plan services, specialty brokerage services, and mutual fund clearing services, and supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds and collective trust funds on third-party platforms. Banking revenues
and expenses are allocated to the Company’s two segments based on which segment services the client. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis, excluding items such as significant nonrecurring gains, impairment
charges on non-financial assets, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and significant restructuring and

Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following tables:

N/M Not
meaningful.

Investor Services

Net revenues were relatively flat in 2012 compared to 2011 as the increases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other
revenue – net were largely offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees relating to Windhaven, partially offset by a decrease in net money
market mutual fund fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to mortgage-backed
securities. Other revenue – net increased primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ order flow revenue and other fees. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades, partially offset by
the inclusion of optionsXpress’ trading activity for the full year. Expenses excluding interest increased by

$102 million, or 5%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of optionsXpress’ compensation and benefits, advertising and market development, and depreciation
and amortization expenses.

Net revenues increased by
$344 million, or 12%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of
interest-earning assets during the year, partially offset by the effect of higher premium amortization relating to residential mortgage-backed securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011. Asset management and administration fees
increased primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees and continued asset inflows, partially offset by decrease in net money market mutual fund fees. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the
addition of optionsXpress. Expenses excluding interest increased by $196 million, or 9%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, and advertising and market development expenses, which
included the integration of optionsXpress.

Institutional
Services

Net revenues increased by $81 million, or 5%,
in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue, partially offset by a decrease in trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in
third-party mutual fund service fees. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning assets, partially offset by the effect of low overall interest rates and higher amortization of premiums relating to
mortgage-backed securities. Trading revenue decreased primarily due to lower daily average revenue trades. Expenses excluding interest increased by $30 million, or 3%, in 2012 from 2011 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits
and occupancy and equipment expenses.

Net revenues increased by
$99 million, or 7%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in net interest revenue, asset management and administration fees, and trading revenue. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest-earning
assets during the year, partially offset by the effect of higher premium amortization relating to residential mortgage-backed securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due
to an increase in mutual fund service fees relating to the Company’s Mutual Fund OneSource funds as a result of continued asset inflows, offset by net money market mutual fund fees waivers. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher
daily average revenue trades. Expenses excluding interest increased by $79 million, or 8%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and professional services expenses.

Unallocated

Other revenue – net in 2012 includes a pre-tax gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor
dispute in the second quarter of 2012. Expenses excluding interest in 2010 include class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund and a charge relating to the Company’s decision to cover the net remaining
losses recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008.

Subsequent Changes to Segment Information

In the first quarter of 2013, the Company realigned its reportable segments as a result of recent organizational changes. The Institutional segment will
be renamed to Advisor Services. The Retirement Plan Services, Corporate Brokerage Retirement Products (formerly part of Retirement Business Services), and Corporate Brokerage Services business units will be reallocated to the Investor Services
segment. The Company will recast the segment information based on this realignment in the first quarter of 2013.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The Company’s capital structure is designed to provide each
subsidiary with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements.

- 28 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSC’s depository institution, is a
federal savings bank. CSC is subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve and Schwab Bank is subject to supervision and regulation by the OCC.

Liquidity

CSC

CSC’s liquidity needs arise from funding its subsidiaries’ operations, including margin and mortgage lending, and transaction settlement, in addition to funding cash dividends, acquisitions,
investments, short- and long-term debt, and managing statutory capital requirements.

CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through
cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the SEC which enables CSC to issue debt, equity and other
securities. CSC maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short-term investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the Company’s business. Generally, CSC does not hold liquidity at its
subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries’ operations, including any regulatory capital requirements. Schwab, Schwab Bank, and optionsXpress, Inc. are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict
them from certain transactions with CSC, as further discussed below. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs,
providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc.’s net capital.

While CSC is not currently subject to specific statutory capital requirements, CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank and must
have the ability to provide financial assistance if Schwab Bank experiences financial distress. To manage capital adequacy, the Company currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, as defined by the Federal Reserve, of at least 6%. At
December 31, 2012, the Company’s Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 6.5%, Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 16.9%, and Total Capital Ratio was 17.0%.

In January and June 2012, the Company completed offerings of its Series A and Series B preferred stock under the Shelf Registration Statement, with an aggregate liquidation preference of
$885 million. CSC’s preferred stock is rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), BBB+ by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (Standard & Poor’s), and BB+ by Fitch Ratings, Ltd (Fitch). For further
discussion of these equity offerings, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 18. Stockholders’ Equity.”

In August 2012, CSC completed an exchange offer with certain eligible holders of its 4.950% Senior Notes due 2014 (Old Senior Notes), whereby Old
Senior Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $256 million were exchanged for the same aggregate principal amount of 3.225% Senior Notes due 2022 (New Senior Notes) and cash consideration of $19 million. On December 6, 2012, CSC
issued $350 million of additional Senior Notes that mature in 2015 under the Shelf Registration Statement, which have a fixed interest rate of 0.850% with interest payable semi-annually. Additionally, on December 21, 2012, CSC redeemed all
of its remaining outstanding Old Senior Notes of $494 million. In connection with the redemption, CSC paid the holders of the Old Senior Notes a make-whole premium of $31 million in addition to the $494 million principal payment. For
further discussion of the Senior Notes, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Borrowings.”

On August 31, 2012, CSC redeemed all of the fixed-to-floating rate trust preferred securities issued by Schwab Capital Trust (Trust) of which $202 million in principal was outstanding for
$207 million. The trust preferred securities were redeemed, along with the common securities issued by the Trust and held by CSC, as a result of the concurrent redemption in whole by CSC of the Junior Subordinated Notes held by the Trust which
underlay the trust preferred securities. For further discussion of this redemption, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Borrowings.”

vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes.
At December 31, 2012, the amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding was $300 million, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The amount outstanding was repaid on
January 2, 2013. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P1 by Moody’s, A1 by Standard & Poor’s, and F1 by Fitch.

CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of 11 banks, which is scheduled to expire in June 2013.
This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in June 2012 and was unused in 2012. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a
minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2012, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this
facility was $5.8 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2012, was $9.6 billion). Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSC’s ability to meet foreseeable dividend or
funding requirements.

CSC also has direct access to
$642 million of the $842 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines discussed below, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. These lines were not used by CSC during 2012.

In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility
maturing in December 2014. There were no funds drawn under this facility at December 31, 2012.

Schwab

Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which
were $37.4 billion and $33.5 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab.

Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to
ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees
if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2012, Schwab’s net capital was $1.4 billion (9% of
aggregate debit balances), which was $1.1 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital and $623 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances.

Schwab is also subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients. These funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for
regulatory purposes in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity.

Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade,
interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing

organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily
represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days.

Schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $95 million at December 31, 2012, is being reduced
by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of 12 years.

To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling $842 million at December 31, 2012. The need for short-term borrowings
arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest-earnings investments, and movements of cash to meet regulatory brokerage client cash segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for
three days in 2012, with average daily amounts borrowed of $62 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2012.

To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, Schwab has unsecured standby letter of
credit agreements (LOCs) with five banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $325 million at December 31, 2012. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain
brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $74 million.
There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2012.

To
manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in March 2014. The amount outstanding under this facility at
December 31, 2012, was $315 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab.

In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $2.5 billion credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. Borrowings under this
facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. There were no funds drawn under this facility at December 31, 2012.

Schwab Bank

Schwab Bank’s liquidity needs are met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital.

The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept
into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2012, these balances totaled $56.9 billion. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2012, the excess cash held in certain optionsXpress, Inc. brokerage accounts was swept into deposit
accounts at Schwab Bank, which totaled $1.3 billion at December 31, 2012.

Schwab Bank is subject to regulatory requirements that restrict and govern the terms of affiliate transactions, such as extensions of credit and repayment of loans between Schwab Bank and CSC or
CSC’s other subsidiaries. In addition, Schwab Bank is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the OCC and the Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC.

Schwab Bank is required to maintain capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations.
Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Schwab Bank. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at
December 31, 2012, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Schwab Bank’s regulatory capital and ratios at December 31, 2012, are as follows:

N/A Not
applicable.

In the third quarter of 2012, management lowered its
target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for Schwab Bank from at least 7.5% to at least 6.25%. This change reflects Schwab Bank’s approach to lending and investing, which results in a lower risk profile relative to the industry and risk-based capital
ratios significantly in excess of well capitalized levels. This allows greater flexibility in managing capital resources to either support Schwab Bank’s balance sheet growth or return capital to CSC.

Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits,
federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, Schwab Bank has access to short-term funding through the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. Amounts available under the FRB discount window are dependent on the fair value of
certain of Schwab Bank’s securities available for sale and/or securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral. Schwab Bank maintains policies and procedures necessary to access this funding and tests discount window borrowing
procedures annually. At December 31, 2012, $2.8 billion was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2012.

Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank
System. Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Bank’s residential real estate mortgages and HELOCs that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2012, $5.5 billion was available under this
facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2012.

CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short-term credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab
Bank. There were no funds drawn under these facilities during 2012.

optionsXpress

Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which
were $1.1 billion at December 31, 2012. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for optionsXpress, Inc.

optionsXpress, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of optionsXpress, is a
registered broker-dealer and is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit optionsXpress, Inc. from paying cash dividends or making
unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31,
2012, optionsXpress Inc.’s net capital was $87 million (40% of aggregate debit balances), which was $82 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $76 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances.

optionsXpress, Inc. is also subject to Commodity Futures Trading
Commission Regulation 1.17 (Reg. 1.17) under the Commodity Exchange Act, which also requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. optionsXpress, Inc. as a futures commission merchant, is required to maintain minimum net capital equal to the
greater of its net capital requirement under

- 32 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

Reg. 1.17 ($1 million), or the sum of 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in customer accounts and 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions
carried in non-customer accounts (as defined in Reg. 1.17).

Additionally, optionsXpress, Inc. is subject to Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and other applicable regulations that require it to
maintain cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of clients. These funds are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the Company’s consolidated balance
sheets and are not available as a general source of liquidity.

CSC provides optionsXpress, Inc. with a $200 million credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in December 2014. There were no borrowings
outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2012. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for optionsXpress, Inc.

optionsXpress has a term loan with CSC, of which $89 million was outstanding at December 31, 2012, and it matures in December 2017.

Capital Resources

The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its
capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total financial capital ratio not to exceed 30%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus
stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2012, was $11.2 billion, up $1.5 billion, or 16%, from December 31, 2011.

The Company’s cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheets) and cash flows are affected by changes in
brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that
date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in security
portfolios, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases and issuances
of CSC’s preferred and common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the cash position during specific time periods.

Long-term Debt

At December 31, 2012, the Company had long-term debt of $1.6 billion, or 15% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a
weighted-average rate of 3.85%. At December 31, 2011, the Company had long-term debt of $2.0 billion, or 21% of total financial capital. For further discussion of the Company’s long-term debt, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources
– Liquidity” and “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 14. Borrowings.”

In addition, the Company repaid $5 million of other long-term debt in
2012. The Company repaid $116 million of long-term debt in 2011, which included the pay off of long-term debt acquired from optionsXpress of $110 million subsequent to the acquisition date.

Capital Expenditures

The Company’s capital expenditures were $138 million (3% of net
revenues) and $190 million (4% of net revenues) in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2012 and 2011 were primarily for capitalized costs for developing internal-use software, software and equipment relating to the
Company’s information technology systems, and leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs for developing internal-use software were $61 million and $57 million in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Management currently anticipates that 2013 capital expenditures will be
approximately 85% higher than 2012 primarily due to increased spending on buildings, leasehold improvements, and software and equipment relating to the Company’s information

- 33 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

technology systems. A majority of this increase is planned to be spent on buildings and leasehold improvements related to the consolidation and relocation of the Company’s existing office
campus in Denver, Colorado. As in recent years, the Company adjusts its capital expenditures periodically as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its
capital expenditures.

Equity Offerings

In January 2012, the Company issued and sold 400,000 shares of
fixed-to-floating rate (currently fixed at 7.000%) non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series A, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share for net proceeds of $394 million (Series A Preferred Stock). In June 2012,
the Company issued and sold 485,000 shares of 6.00% non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series B, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share for net proceeds of $469 million (Series B Preferred Stock). Net proceeds
received from these sales were used for general corporate purposes. For further discussion of these equity offerings, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements –
18. Stockholders’ Equity.”

Dividends

CSC paid common stock cash dividends of
$308 million ($0.24 per share) and $295 million ($0.24 per share) in 2012 and 2011, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 95 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend
rate 19 times, including a 20% increase in the third quarter of 2008. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 23% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. While the payment and
amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board of Directors, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.

CSC paid Series A Preferred Stock cash dividends of $14 million
($36.17 per share) and Series B Preferred Stock cash dividends of $14 million ($29.17 per share) in 2012. On December 12, 2012, CSC declared a semi-annual dividend of $35.00 per share of Series A Preferred Stock
that is payable February 1, 2013, to stockholders of record on January 17, 2013. Under the respective terms of the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, the Company’s ability to pay dividends on, make
distributions with respect to, or to repurchase, redeem or acquire its common stock or any preferred stock ranking on parity with or junior to the relevant series of preferred stock, is subject to restrictions in the event that the Company does not
declare and either pay or set aside a sum sufficient for payment of dividends on the relevant series of preferred stock for the immediately preceding dividend period. For further discussion of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock
offerings, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 18. Stockholders’ Equity.”

Share Repurchases

There were no repurchases of CSC’s common stock in 2012 or 2011. As of December 31, 2012, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of
Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock, which does not have an expiration date.

Business Acquisitions

On December 14, 2012, the Company acquired ThomasPartners, Inc., a growth and dividend income-focused asset management firm, for $85 million in cash.

On September 1, 2011, the Company acquired optionsXpress, an online
brokerage firm primarily focused on equity option securities and futures, for total consideration of $714 million. Under the terms of the merger agreement, optionsXpress stockholders received 1.02 shares of the Company’s common stock for
each share of optionsXpress stock. As a result, the Company issued 59 million shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $710 million, based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on September 1, 2011. The
Company also assumed optionsXpress’ stock-based compensation awards valued at $4 million.

For more information on these acquisitions, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 3. Business Acquisitions.”

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit.
Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary
Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 15. Commitments and Contingencies.”

Contractual Obligations

The Company’s principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2012, are shown in the following table. Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash
provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short-term in nature (e.g., payables
to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).

software-related agreements. Includes purchase obligations that can be canceled by the Company without penalty.

RISK MANAGEMENT

Overview

The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks, including operational, credit, market, liquidity, and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential
to the success and financial soundness of the Company.

The Board
of Directors has approved an enterprise risk management framework that is commensurate with the size, risk profile, complexity, and continuing growth of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Company’s risk management
process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. The Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major
business and control functions, is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures and leading the continued development of the Company’s risk management policies and practices.

- 35 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

Functional risk sub-committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee.
These sub-committees include the:

•

Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, interest rate risk, and
investments;

•

Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on credit exposures resulting from client borrowing activity (e.g., margin lending activities
and loans to banking clients), investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds, corporate credit and investment activity, and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client
trading activity;

•

New Products & Services Subcommittee, which reviews the risks associated with the launch of new product classes, services and offers;

•

Operational Risk Oversight Committee, which provides oversight of and approves operational risk management policies, risk tolerance levels, and
operational risk governance processes, and includes the following subcommittees:

•

Information Security and Privacy Committee, which oversees information security and privacy policies, procedures and controls; and the

•

Model Governance Committee, which provides oversight of model risk throughout the Company.

The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit and Risk Committees
of the Board of Directors, which review major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.

The Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls
and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

The Company’s compliance,
finance, internal audit, legal, and corporate risk management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management.

Risk is inherent in the Company’s business. Consequently, despite the
Company’s efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operational or other risks. The following discussion
highlights the Company’s policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations.

Operational Risk

Operational risk is the potential for loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes, people, and systems or from external events and relationships
impacting CSC and/or any of its key business partners and vendors. Operational risk includes fiduciary, legal and compliance risk, and each are also described in detail below.

The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its
technology systems and the Company’s success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions,
errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and
operations could be significantly negatively impacted. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed
to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms.

Operational risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct,
external fraud, computer viruses, distributed denial of service attacks, terrorist attacks, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential
client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes

- 36 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such
fraud attempts continue to increase.

Operational risk is
mitigated through a system of internal controls and risk management practices that are designed to keep operational risk and operational losses at levels appropriate to the inherent risk of the business in which the Company operates. The Company has
specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery
functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems
and data.

Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it
is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and
regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.

The Company also faces operational risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of
certain technology, processing, servicing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains
policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and
vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security.

The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research
and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts.

Fiduciary Risk

Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are
not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged
faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation,
approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees.

Legal and Compliance Risk

The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have
been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the
adequacy of the Company’s controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it
provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is
becoming increasingly extensive and complex.

The Company attempts
to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business
conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit,

- 37 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective
compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual
obligations. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and other investing
activities. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements
for certain securities. Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements include provisions that require additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the
value of collateral received. Additionally, for margin loan and securities lending agreements, collateral arrangements require that the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned.

The Company’s credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients
is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, nonaccrual loans, charge-offs, and recoveries. All are factors in the
determination of an appropriate allowance for loan losses, which is reviewed quarterly by management. The Company’s mortgage loan portfolios primarily include First Mortgages of $6.5 billion and HELOCs of $3.3 billion at
December 31, 2012.

The Company’s First Mortgage
portfolio underwriting requirements are generally consistent with the underwriting requirements in the secondary market for loan portfolios. The Company’s underwriting guidelines include maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, cash out limits, and
minimum Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment
property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo). These credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high
foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry in recent years. There have been no significant changes to the LTV ratio or FICO credit score underwriting guidelines related to the Company’s First Mortgage or HELOC portfolios during 2012.
The Company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO credit score of less than 620 at origination), unless the
borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2012, approximately 1% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with updated FICO credit scores of less than 620.

At December 31, 2012, the weighted-average originated LTV ratios were
60% and 59% for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The computation of the origination LTV ratio for a HELOC includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of origination. At December 31, 2012,
22% of HELOCs ($725 million of the HELOC portfolio) were in a first lien position. The weighted-average originated FICO credit score was 768 for both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios.

The Company monitors the estimated current LTV ratios of its First Mortgage
and HELOC portfolios on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2012, the weighted-average estimated current LTV ratios were 62% and 72% for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The computation of the estimated current LTV ratio for
a HELOC includes any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC’s origination. The Company estimates the current LTV ratio for each loan by reference to a home price appreciation index. The Company also
monitors updated borrower FICO scores, delinquency trends, and verified liquid assets held by individual borrowers. At December 31, 2012, the weighted-average updated FICO scores were 768 and 767 for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios,
respectively.

A portion of the Company’s HELOC portfolio is
secured by second liens on the associated properties. Second lien mortgage loans possess a higher degree of credit risk given the subordination to the first lien holder in the event of default. At

December 31, 2012, $2.6 billion, or 78%, of the HELOC portfolio was in a second lien position. In addition to the credit monitoring activities described above, the Company also monitors
credit risk on second lien HELOC loans by reviewing the delinquency status of the first lien loan on the associated property, when such status is available. The portion of the Company’s second lien HELOC portfolio for which the Company either
holds the first lien or has the ability to monitor the delinquency status of the related first mortgage was $477 million, or 15%, of the HELOC portfolio at December 31, 2012. Additionally, at December 31, 2012, approximately 35% of
the HELOC borrowers that had a balance only paid the minimum amount due.

For more information on the Company’s credit quality indicators relating to its First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, including delinquency characteristics, borrower FICO scores at origination,
updated borrower FICO scores, LTV ratios at origination, and estimated current LTV ratios, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 7. Loans to Banking Clients and
Related Allowance for Loan Losses.”

The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity
portfolios, whose fair values totaled $46.1 billion and $18.7 billion at December 31, 2012, respectively. These portfolios include U.S. agency and non-agency mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, corporate debt
securities, certificates of deposit, U.S. agency notes, commercial paper, and other securities. U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings, however, management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and
rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered to be “Prime”
(defined by the Company as loans to borrowers with a FICO credit score of 620 or higher at origination), and “Alt-A” (defined by the Company as Prime loans with reduced documentation at origination).

Residential mortgage-backed securities, particularly Alt-A securities,
experienced continued credit deterioration in 2012, including increased payment delinquency rates and losses on foreclosures of underlying mortgages. For a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on residential mortgage-backed
securities, see “Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.” At December 31, 2012, the amortized cost of non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities represented 2% of the total mortgage-backed securities
portfolio. These securities were originated between 2003 and 2007. At December 31, 2012, all of the corporate debt securities and non-mortgage asset-backed securities were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moody’s
rating of “Baa” or higher, or a Standard & Poor’s rating of “BBB-” or higher).

Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual
funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab.

The Company sponsors a number of proprietary money market mutual funds and other proprietary funds. Although the Company has no obligation to do so, the
Company may decide for competitive reasons to provide credit, liquidity or other support to its funds in the event of significant declines in valuation of fund holdings or significant redemption activity that exceeds available liquidity. Such
support could cause the Company to take significant charges and could reduce the Company’s liquidity. If the Company chose not to provide credit, liquidity or other support in such a situation, the Company could suffer reputational damage and
its business could be adversely affected.

Concentration Risk

The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions
in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry.

The fair value of the Company’s investments in mortgage-backed securities totaled $39.5 billion at December 31, 2012. Of these,
$38.8 billion were issued by U.S. agencies and $733 million were issued by private entities (non-agency securities). The U.S. agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity and the
non-agency securities are included in securities available for sale. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by Alt-A loans. At December 31, 2012, the amortized cost and fair value of Alt-A
mortgage-backed securities were $308 million and $269 million, respectively.

The Company’s investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $8.0 billion at December 31, 2012, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services
industry. These securities are included in securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The Company’s loans to banking clients include $6.0 billion of
adjustable rate first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2012. The Company’s adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and interest rates that adjust annually thereafter.
Approximately 50% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 65% of these interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Company’s mortgage loans do
not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. At December 31, 2012, 45% of the residential real estate mortgages and 50% of the HELOC balances were secured by properties which are located in
California.

The Company’s HELOC product has a 30-year loan
term with an initial draw period of 10 years from the date of origination. After the initial draw period, the balance outstanding at such time is converted to a 20-year amortizing loan. The interest rate during the initial draw period and the
20-year amortizing period is a floating rate based on the prime rate plus a margin. The following table presents when current outstanding HELOCs will convert to amortizing loans:

As of December 31, 2012, all of the
Company’s HELOC loans are within the 10-year initial draw period, and as such, none of the HELOCs have converted to an amortizing loan.

The Company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or
industry. This concentration risk is mitigated by collateral arrangements that require the fair value of such collateral exceeds the amounts loaned.

The Company has indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary
credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. The fair value of U.S.
Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $19.7 billion at December 31, 2012.

European Holdings

The Company has exposure to non-sovereign financial and non-financial
institutions in Europe. The following table shows the balances of this exposure by each country in Europe in which the issuer or counterparty is domiciled. The Company has no direct exposure to sovereign governments in Europe. The Company does not
have unfunded commitments to counterparties in Europe, nor does it have exposure as a result of credit default protection purchased or sold separately as of December 31, 2012.

The determination of the domicile of exposure varies by the type of
investment. For time deposits and certificates of deposit, the exposure is grouped in the country in which the financial institution is chartered under the regulatory framework of the European country. For asset-backed commercial paper, the exposure
is grouped by the country of the sponsoring bank that provides the credit and liquidity support for such instruments. For corporate debt securities, the exposure is grouped by the country in which the issuer is domiciled. In situations in which the
Company invests in a corporate debt security of a U.S. subsidiary of a European parent company, such holdings will be attributable to the European country only if significant reliance is placed on the European parent company for credit support
underlying the security. For substantially all of the holdings listed below, the issuers or counterparties were financial institutions. All of the Company’s resale agreements, which are included in investments segregated and on deposit for
regulatory purposes, are collateralized by U.S. government securities. Additionally, the Company’s securities lending activities are collateralized by cash. Therefore, the Company’s resale agreements and securities lending activities are
not included in the table below even if the counterparty is a European institution.

The exposures in Denmark are also backed by the full faith and credit of the Danish government.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

In addition to the direct holdings of European companies listed above, the Company also has indirect
exposure to Europe through its investments in Schwab sponsored money market funds (collectively, the Funds) resulting from clearing activities. At December 31, 2012, the Company had $329 million in investments in these Funds. Certain of
the Funds’ positions include certificates of deposits, time deposits, commercial paper and corporate debt securities issued by counterparties in Europe.

Management mitigates exposure to European holdings by employing a separate team of credit analysts that evaluate each issuer, counterparty, and country. Management monitors its exposure to European
issuers by 1) performing risk assessments of the foreign countries, which include evaluating the size of the country and economy, currency trends, political landscape and the countries’ regulatory environment and developments, 2) performing ad
hoc stress tests that evaluate the impact of sovereign governments’ debt write-downs on the issuers and counterparties to our investments, 3) reviewing publicly available stress tests that are published by various regulators in the European
market, 4) establishing credit and maturity limits by issuer, and 5) monitoring aggregate exposures by country.

Market Risk

Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations
in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For discussion of the Company’s market risk, see “Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

The Company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. Assets are measured at fair value using quoted prices or
market-based information and accordingly are classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in fair value measurement accounting guidance. Liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at
December 31, 2012 or 2011. See “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and 17. Fair Values of Assets and
Liabilities” for more information on the Company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value.

When available, the Company uses
quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data with a bid-ask spread, the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not
exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. The Company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair
value and may obtain up to five prices on assets with higher risk of limited observable information, such as non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on
observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar
“to-be-issued” securities. The Company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary
independent pricing service is reasonable. The Company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the
recorded amounts. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Company did not adjust prices received from the primary independent third-party pricing service.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The consolidated financial
statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain
accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial position and

- 42 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s
financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy.

Other-than-Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity

Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities
held to maturity are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be
required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and
the then-current fair value.

A security is also OTTI if
management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. The impairment
recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Expected cash flows are discounted using the security’s effective interest rate.

The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost
of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including: the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent (30 days, 60 days, 90+ days), in bankruptcy, in foreclosure or
converted to real estate owned; the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold; the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses
on the underlying loans; the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments. Management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of
other-than-temporary impairment for the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. To develop the cash flow models, the Company uses forecasted loss severity, prepayment speeds (i.e. the rate at which the principal on
underlying loans are paid down), and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities.

Valuation of Goodwill

The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting
in an impairment charge for this excess. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or
other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill.

The Company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date is April 1

st

. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2012, the fair values of the Company’s
reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) substantially exceeded their carrying values, and therefore management concluded that no amount of
goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair values of the reporting units were established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit and a market
capitalization analysis. As allowed by applicable accounting standards, the Company can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value.

Allowance for Loan Losses

The appropriateness of the allowance is reviewed quarterly by management,
taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio.

The methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the
loan segments based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the segments. The methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price

- 43 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted)

movements as measured by a housing price index, economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds,
loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk measured by FICO scores, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments including loan
products, year of origination, geographical distribution of collateral, and the portion of borrowers who have other client relationships with the Company.

Probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with
the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans
transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Further, the delinquency roll rates within the loan-level
simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios. Loss severity estimates are based on the Company’s historical loss
experience and market trends. The estimated loss severity (i.e. loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for HELOCs is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages. Housing price trends are derived from
historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the
current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. As a result, the current state of house prices, including the decrease in general house prices experienced over the last
several years, as well as the current state of delinquencies unique to the Company’s First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, are considered in the allowance for loan loss methodology.

This methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for loan loss
for each loan segment.

Legal and Regulatory Reserves

Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings
reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and
the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which
case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter
may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved.

The
Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed
in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of
financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions.

For the Company’s market risk related to interest rates, a sensitivity analysis, referred to as a net interest revenue simulation model, is shown
below. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in market interest rates on its interest-earning assets relative to changes in the costs of its funding sources that finance these assets.

Net interest revenue is affected by various factors, such as the distribution
and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, the spread between yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, which may re-price at different times or by different amounts,
and the spread between short and long-term interest rates. Interest-earning assets include residential real estate loans and mortgage-backed securities. These assets are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to changes to prepayment levels,
which tend to increase in a declining rate environment.

To
mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk, and monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets
and funding sources. To remain within these guidelines, the Company manages the maturity, repricing, and cash flow characteristics of the investment portfolios. Because the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances
and deposits from banking clients, the rates charged on margin loans, and controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread, depending on competitive factors and market conditions.

The Company is also subject to market risk as a result of
fluctuations in equity prices. The Company’s direct holdings of equity securities and its associated exposure to equity prices are not material. The Company is indirectly exposed to equity market fluctuations in connection with securities
collateralizing margin loans to brokerage customers, and customer securities loaned out as part of the Company’s securities lending activities. Equity market valuations may also affect the level of brokerage client trading activity, margin
borrowing, and overall client engagement with the Company. Additionally, the Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by
changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company.

Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to liquidity risk – that is, the risk that valuations will be negatively affected by changes in demand and the underlying market for a
financial instrument. Recent conditions in the credit markets have significantly reduced market liquidity in a wide range of financial instruments, including the types of instruments held by the Company, and fair value can differ significantly from
the value implied by the credit quality and actual performance of the instrument’s underlying cash flows.

Financial instruments held by the Company are also subject to valuation risk as a result of changes in valuations of the underlying collateral, such as housing prices in the case of residential real
estate loans and mortgage-backed securities.

For discussion of
the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and securities available for sale, see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations – Current Market and Regulatory Environment and Other Developments.”

The Company’s market risk related to financial instruments held for trading is not material.

Net Interest Revenue Simulation

The Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The simulation model
(the model) includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities. Key variables in the model include the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment, reinvestment, and product pricing assumptions. The Company uses constant balances and market
rates in the model assumptions in order to minimize the number of variables and to better isolate risks. The simulations involve assumptions that are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or predict
the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated

- 47 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

results due to balance growth or decline and the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes, as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in
asset and liability mix.

As represented by the simulations
presented below, the Company’s investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets
generally reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities).

The simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of
the simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from
changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates relative to the Company’s current market rates forecast on simulated net interest
revenue over the next 12 months beginning December 31, 2012 and 2011.

Increase of 100 basis points

19.2

%

Decrease of 100 basis points

(8.1

The sensitivities shown in the simulation
reflect the fact that short-term interest rates in 2012 remained at historically low levels, including the federal funds target rate, which was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to
which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources in a declining interest rate scenario. A decline in interest rates could therefore negatively impact the yield on the Company’s investment portfolio to a greater degree than
any offsetting reduction in interest expense, further compressing net interest margin. Any increases in short-term interest rates result in a greater impact as yields on interest-earning assets are expected to rise faster than the cost of funding
sources.

1.     Introduction and Basis of Presentation

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC)
is a savings and loan holding company engaged, through its subsidiaries, in securities brokerage, banking, money management, and financial advisory services. Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (Schwab) is a securities broker-dealer with over 300
domestic branch offices in 45 states, as well as a branch in each of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and London, U.K. In addition, Schwab serves clients in Hong Kong through one of CSC’s subsidiaries. Other subsidiaries include Charles Schwab
Bank (Schwab Bank), a federal savings bank, and Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM), the investment advisor for Schwab’s proprietary mutual funds, which are referred to as the Schwab Funds

®

, and for Schwab’s exchange-traded funds, which are referred to as the Schwab ETFs

TM

.

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include CSC and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively referred to as
the Company). Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S.), which require management
to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying financial statements. Certain estimates relate to other-than-temporary impairment of securities available for sale and securities held to maturity,
valuation of goodwill, allowance for loan losses, and legal and regulatory reserves. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Asset management and administration fees

Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund
service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients, and are recognized as revenue over the period that the related service is provided, based upon average asset balances. The Company earns
mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of
client assets invested in these funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions, which include advisory and managed account services that are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for
service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third-party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset based fees, such
as third-party mutual fund service fees, trust fees, 401(k) record keeping fees, and mutual fund clearing and other service fees.

In 2012, 2011, and 2010, the Company waived a portion of its asset management fees earned from certain Schwab-sponsored money market mutual funds in order
to provide a positive return to clients. Under agreements with these funds, the Company may recover such fee waivers depending on the future performance of the funds and approval by the boards of the respective funds until the third anniversary of
the end of the fiscal year in which such fee waiver occurs, subject to certain limitations. Recoveries of previously-waived asset management fees are recognized as revenue when substantially all uncertainties about timing and amount of realization
are resolved.

Interest revenue

Interest revenue represents interest earned on cash and cash equivalents,
cash and investments segregated, receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations, receivables from brokerage clients, other securities owned, securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, and loans to banking clients.
Interest revenue is recognized in the period earned based upon average or daily asset balances and respective interest rates.

Trading revenue

Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Clients’ securities transactions are recorded on the date that they settle,
while the related commission revenues and expenses are recorded on the date that the trade occurs.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

Principal transaction revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from trading activity in client fixed income securities, which is recorded on a trade date basis. To accommodate clients’
fixed income trading activity, the Company maintains positions in fixed income securities, including state and municipal debt obligations, U.S. Government, corporate debt and other securities. The difference between the price at which the Company
buys and sells securities to and from its clients and other broker-dealers is recognized as principal transaction revenue. Principal transaction revenue also includes unrealized gains and losses on these securities positions.

Cash and cash equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities
of three months or less that are not segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes to be cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents include money market funds, deposits with banks, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and treasury
securities. Cash and cash equivalents also include balances that Schwab Bank maintains at the Federal Reserve Bank.

Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes

Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes include securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements), which
are collateralized by U.S. Government and agency securities. Resale agreements are accounted for as collateralized investing transactions that are recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued interest. The Company obtains control of collateral
with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned and accrued interest under resale agreements. Collateral is valued daily by the Company, with additional collateral obtained to ensure full collateralization. Cash and
investments segregated also include certificates of deposit, U.S. Government securities, and corporate debt securities. Certificates of deposit, U.S. Government securities, and corporate debt securities are recorded at fair value. Pursuant to
applicable regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients.

Receivables from brokerage clients

Receivables from brokerage clients include margin loans to clients and are
recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Receivables from brokerage clients that remain unsecured or partially secured for more than 30 days are fully reserved.

Other securities owned

Other securities owned are recorded at fair value based on quoted market
prices. Unrealized gains and losses are included in trading revenue.

Securities available for sale and securities held to maturity

Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in stockholders’ equity.
Securities held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost based on the Company’s positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Realized gains and losses from sales of securities available for sale are determined on a
specific identification basis and are included in other revenue – net.

Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are
considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these
circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and the then-current fair value.

A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, management utilizes cash flow
models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities to estimate the credit loss.

- 56 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

The impairment recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Expected cash flows are discounted
using the security’s effective interest rate.

The evaluation
of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including: the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent
(30 days, 60 days, 90+ days), in bankruptcy, in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned; the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold; the amount of credit support
provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans; the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments.
Management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of other-than-temporary impairment for the Company’s non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. To develop the cash flow models, the Company uses forecasted loss
severity, prepayment speeds (i.e. the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down), and default rates over the securities’ expected remaining maturities.

Securities borrowed and securities loaned

Securities borrowed require the Company to deliver cash to the lender in
exchange for securities and are included in receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. For securities loaned, the Company receives collateral in the form of cash in an amount equal to or greater than the market value of
securities loaned. Securities loaned are included in payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. The Company monitors the market value of securities borrowed and loaned, with additional collateral obtained or refunded to ensure full
collateralization. Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest expense.

Loans to banking clients and related allowance for loan losses

Loans to banking clients are recorded at their contractual principal amounts and include unamortized direct origination costs or net purchase premiums. Additionally, loans are recorded net of an allowance
for loan losses. The Company’s loan portfolio includes four loan segments: residential real estate mortgages, home equity lines of credit (HELOC), personal loans secured by securities and other loans. Residential real estate mortgages include
two loan classes: first mortgages and purchased first mortgages. Loan segments are defined as the level to which the Company disaggregates its loan portfolio when developing and documenting a methodology for determining the allowance for loan
losses. A loan class is defined as a group of loans within a loan segment that has homogeneous risk characteristics.

The Company records an allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings based on management’s estimate of probable losses in the existing
portfolio. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio to ensure that
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at an appropriate level.

The methodology to establish an allowance for loan losses utilizes statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and probable losses for the loan segments based on predicted behavior of
individual loans within the segments. The methodology considers the effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rates, housing price movements as measured by a housing price index, economic
conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures measured by historical and expected delinquencies, changes in prepayment speeds, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, past loss experience, estimates of future loss severities, borrower credit risk measured by
Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and the adequacy of collateral. The methodology also evaluates concentrations in the loan segments, including loan products, year of origination, geographical distribution of collateral, and the portion of
borrowers who have other client relationships with the Company.

Probable losses are forecast using a loan-level simulation of the delinquency status of the loans over the term of the loans. The simulation starts with
the current relevant risk indicators, including the current delinquent status of each loan, the estimated current LTV ratio of each loan, the term and structure of each loan, current key interest rates including U.S. Treasury and London Interbank
Offered Rate (LIBOR) rates, and borrower FICO scores. The more significant variables in the simulation

- 57 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

include delinquency roll rates, loss severity, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately
result in a loss) are estimated from the Company’s historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Further, the delinquency roll rates within the loan-level simulation discussed above are calibrated to match a
moving average of the delinquency roll rates actually experienced in the respective first lien residential real estate mortgage loan (First Mortgage) and home equity line of credit (HELOC) portfolios. Loss severity estimates are based on the
Company’s historical loss experience and market trends. The estimated loss severity (i.e. loss given default) used in the allowance for loan loss methodology for HELOC loans is higher than that used in the methodology for First Mortgages.
Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and econometric forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations.
Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. As a result, the current state of house prices, including the decrease in general
house prices experienced over the last several years, as well as the current state of delinquencies unique to the Company’s First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, are considered in the allowance for loan loss methodology.

This methodology results in loss factors that are applied to the outstanding
balances to determine the allowance for loan loss for each loan segment.

The Company considers loan modifications in which it makes an economic concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty to be a troubled debt restructuring.

Nonaccrual loans

Residential real estate mortgages, HELOC, personal, and other loans are
placed on nonaccrual status upon becoming 90 days past due as to interest or principal (unless the loans are well-secured and in the process of collection), or when the full timely collection of interest or principal becomes uncertain. For the
portion of the HELOC portfolio for which the Company is able to track the delinquency status on the associated first lien loan, the Company places a HELOC on non-accrual status if the associated first mortgage is 90 days or more delinquent,
regardless of the payment status of the HELOC. When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, the accrued and unpaid interest receivable is reversed and the loan is accounted for on the cash or cost recovery method thereafter, until qualifying for
return to accrual status. Generally, a nonaccrual loan may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent interest and principal is repaid and the borrower demonstrates a sustained period of performance of twelve consecutive months of repayments,
or when the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection and collectability is no longer doubtful.

Loan Charge-Offs

The Company charges off a loan in the period that it is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the allowance for loan losses and the loan balance. The Company’s charge-off policy for
residential real estate mortgages and HELOC loans is to assess the value of the property when the loan has been delinquent for 180 days or it is in bankruptcy, regardless of whether or not the property is in foreclosure, and charge-off the amount of
the loan balance in excess of the estimated current value of the underlying property less estimated costs to sell.

Equipment, office facilities, and property

Equipment, office facilities, and property are recorded at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, except for land, which is recorded at cost. Equipment and office facilities are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three to ten years. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over 20 to 40 years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Software and certain costs incurred for purchasing or developing software for internal use are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three or five years.
Equipment, office facilities, and property are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the fair value of acquired
businesses in excess of the fair value of the individually identified net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or whenever indications of impairment exist. In testing for potential impairment of goodwill,
management estimates the fair values of each of the Company’s reporting units (defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compares it to their carrying values.
The estimated fair values of the reporting units are established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit and a market capitalization analysis.
As allowed by applicable accounting standards, the Company can elect to qualitatively assess goodwill for impairment if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value. The Company’s annual
impairment testing date is April 1

st

.

Intangible assets

Intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives in a manner that
best reflects their economic benefit. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. The Company does not have any indefinite-lived
intangible assets.

Guarantees and indemnifications

The Company recognizes, at the inception of a guarantee, a
liability equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair values of the obligations relating to standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) are estimated based on fees charged to enter into similar
agreements, considering the creditworthiness of the counterparties. The fair values of the obligations relating to other guarantees are estimated based on transactions for similar guarantees or expected present value measures.

Income taxes

The Company provides for income taxes on all transactions that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, deferred tax assets are adjusted to reflect the tax rates at which future taxable amounts will likely be settled or realized. The effects of tax rate changes on future deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, as well as other
changes in income tax laws, are recorded in earnings in the period during which such changes are enacted. The Company’s unrecognized tax benefits, which are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities, represent the difference between
positions taken on tax return filings and estimated potential tax settlement outcomes. Interest and penalties relating to unrecognized tax benefits are recorded in income tax expense.

Stock-based compensation

Stock-based compensation includes employee and board of director stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock awards. The Company measures
compensation expense for these share-based payment arrangements based on their estimated fair values as of the awards’ grant date. The fair value of the share-based award is recognized over the vesting period as stock-based compensation.
Stock-based compensation expense is based on awards expected to vest and therefore is reduced for estimated forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on the Company’s historical forfeiture experience and revised in
subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. The excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards are recorded in additional paid-in capital.

Fair values of assets and liabilities

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset
or the price paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement accounting guidance describes the fair value hierarchy for disclosing assets and liabilities measured at
fair value based on the inputs used to value them. The fair value hierarchy maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs. Observable inputs are

- 59 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

based on market pricing data obtained from sources independent of the Company. A quoted price in an active market provides the most reliable evidence of fair value and is generally used to
measure fair value whenever available. Unobservable inputs reflect management’s judgment about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Where inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or liability are
from different levels of the hierarchy, the asset or liability is categorized based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Assessing the significance of a particular input requires judgment. The
fair value hierarchy includes three levels based on the objectivity of the inputs as follows:

•

Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets as of the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
to access.

•

Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, such as interest rates, benchmark yields, issuer spreads,
new issue data, and collateral performance.

•

Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and include situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the
asset or liability.

Assets and
liabilities recorded at fair value

The Company uses the
market and income approaches to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities. When available, the Company uses quoted prices in active markets to measure the fair value of assets and liabilities. When utilizing market data and bid-ask spread,
the Company uses the price within the bid-ask spread that best represents fair value. When quoted prices do not exist, the Company uses prices obtained from independent third-party pricing services to measure the fair value of investment assets. The
Company generally obtains prices from at least three independent pricing sources for assets recorded at fair value and may obtain up to five prices on assets with higher risk of limited observable information, such as non-agency residential
mortgage-backed securities. The Company’s primary independent pricing service provides prices based on observable trades and discounted cash flows that incorporate observable information such as yields for similar types of securities (a
benchmark interest rate plus observable spreads) and weighted-average maturity for the same or similar “to-be-issued” securities. The Company compares the prices obtained from its primary independent pricing service to the prices obtained
from the additional independent pricing services to determine if the price obtained from the primary independent pricing service is reasonable. The Company does not adjust the prices received from independent third-party pricing services unless such
prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts.

Financial instruments not recorded at fair value

Descriptions of the valuation methodologies and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of financial instruments not recorded at fair value are
described below. The Company’s financial instruments not recorded at fair value but for which fair value can be approximated and disclosed include:

•

Cash and cash equivalents

are short-term in nature and accordingly are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value.

•

Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes

include cash and securities purchased under resale agreements. Securities
purchased under resale agreements are short-term in nature and are backed by collateral that both exceeds the carrying value of the resale agreement and is highly liquid in nature. Accordingly, the carrying value approximates fair value.

•

Receivables from/payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations

are recorded at contractual amounts and historically have been settled
at those values and are short-term in nature, and therefore approximate fair value.

- 60 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

•

Receivables from/payables to brokerage clients – net

are recorded at contractual amounts and historically have been settled at those values
and are short-term in nature, and therefore approximate fair value.

•

Securities held to maturity –

The fair values of securities held to maturity are obtained using an independent third-party pricing service
similar to investment assets recorded at fair value as discussed above.

•

Loans to banking clients

– The fair values of the Company’s loans to banking clients are estimated based on prices of mortgage-backed
securities collateralized by similar types of loans.

•

Loans held for sale

at December 31, 2011, were recorded at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of the Company’s loans held
for sale was estimated using quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans.

•

Financial instruments included in other assets

primarily consist of cost method investments and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) stock, whose
carrying values approximate their fair values. FHLB stock is recorded at par, which approximates fair value.

•

Deposits from banking clients

have no stated maturity and are recorded at the amount payable on demand as of the balance sheet date. The Company
considers the carrying value of these deposits to approximate their fair values.

•

Financial instruments included in accrued expenses and other liabilities

consist of commercial paper, drafts payable and certain amounts due
under contractual obligations which are short-term in nature and accordingly are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value.

•

Long-term debt –

Except for the finance lease obligation, the fair values of long-term debt are estimated using indicative, non-binding
quotes from independent brokers. The Company validates indicative prices for its debt through comparison to other independent non-binding quotes. The finance lease obligation is recorded at carrying value, which approximates fair value.

•

Firm commitments to extend credit

– The Company extends credit to banking clients through HELOC and personal loans secured by securities.
The Company considers the fair value of these unused commitments to be not material because the interest rates earned on these balances are based on floating interest rates that reset monthly. The Company does not charge a fee to maintain a HELOC or
personal loan.

Adoption of New Accounting
Standards

Testing Goodwill for Impairment:

In
September 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new guidance allowing companies to consider qualitative factors before performing a quantitative assessment when determining whether goodwill is impaired, which is effective for
goodwill impairment tests performed after January 1, 2012. Specifically, there is no longer a requirement to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test unless the entity determines that based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than
not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, earnings per common share (EPS), or cash
flows.

Business Acquisitions

optionsXpress Holdings, Inc.

On September 1, 2011, the Company acquired
optionsXpress Holdings, Inc. (optionsXpress) for total consideration of $714 million. optionsXpress is an online brokerage firm primarily focused on equity option securities and futures. The optionsXpress

variety of investment strategies. The combination of optionsXpress and Schwab offers active investors an additional level of service and platform capabilities.

Under the terms of the merger agreement, optionsXpress stockholders received
1.02 shares of the Company’s common stock for each share of optionsXpress stock. As a result, the Company issued 59 million shares of the Company’s common stock valued at $710 million, based on the closing price of the
Company’s common stock on September 1, 2011. The Company also assumed optionsXpress’ stock-based compensation awards valued at $4 million.

The results of optionsXpress’ operations have been included in the Company’s consolidated statement of income for the year ended
December 31, 2012 and 2011, from the date of acquisition. optionsXpress’ net revenues and net income were $179 million and $6 million, respectively, in 2012. optionsXpress’ net revenues were $68 million and their net
loss was not material for the period September 1, 2011 through December 31, 2011.

The Company recorded intangible assets of $285 million, which are subject to amortization and will
be amortized over their estimated useful lives. The following table summarizes the estimated fair value and useful lives of the intangible assets.

Pro Forma Financial Information
(Unaudited)

The following table presents unaudited pro forma
financial information as if optionsXpress had been acquired prior to January 1, 2010. Pro forma net income for the year ended December 31, 2011, was adjusted to exclude $16 million, after tax, of acquisition related costs incurred by
the Company in 2011. Additionally, pro forma net income below excludes $15 million, before tax, of acquisition related costs because these costs were incurred by optionsXpress prior to the acquisition date. Pro forma net income also reflects
the impact of amortizing purchase accounting adjustments relating to intangible assets, net of tax, of $20 million and $22 million, for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

The unaudited pro forma financial information
above is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had the acquisition been completed prior to January 1, 2010, nor is it indicative of the results of operations
for future periods.

Other Business Acquisitions

On December 14, 2012, the Company acquired
ThomasPartners, Inc., a growth and dividend income-focused asset management firm, for $85 million in cash. As a result of a preliminary allocation of the purchase price, the Company recorded goodwill of $68 million and intangible assets of
$36 million. The intangible assets primarily relate to customer relationships and will be amortized over 11 years. The preliminary goodwill was allocated to the Investor Services and Institutional Services segments in the amounts of
$44 million and $24 million, respectively.

On
November 9, 2010, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Windward Investment Management, Inc. (Windward) for $106 million in common stock and $44 million in cash. Windward was an investment advisory firm that managed
diversified investment portfolios comprised primarily of exchange-traded fund securities. As a result of the acquisition, Windhaven Investment Management, Inc. was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schwab Holdings, Inc.

4.

Receivables from Brokerage Clients

Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of
margin loans to brokerage clients of $11.6 billion and $10.2 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Securities owned by brokerage clients are held as collateral for margin loans. Such collateral is not reflected in the
consolidated financial statements. The average yield earned on margin loans was 4.08% and 4.39% in 2012 and 2011, respectively.

(1)

The number of investment positions with unrealized losses totaled 296 for securities available for sale and 3 for securities held to maturity.

Unrealized losses in securities available for
sale of $73 million as of December 31, 2012, were concentrated in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities. Included in non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered
to be “Prime” (defined as loans to borrowers with a FICO credit score of 620 or higher at origination), and “Alt-A” (defined as Prime loans with reduced documentation at origination). At December 31, 2012, the amortized cost
and fair value of Alt-A residential mortgage-backed securities were $308 million and $269 million, respectively.

Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other-than-temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis
as described in note “2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Certain Alt-A and Prime residential mortgage-backed securities experienced continued credit deterioration in 2012, including increased payment delinquency rates and losses on foreclosures of
underlying mortgages. In addition, during 2012 the Company increased the projected default rates for modified loans underlying the securities. Based on the Company’s cash flow projections, management determined that it does not expect to
recover all of the amortized cost of these securities and therefore determined that these securities were OTTI. The Company employs a buy and hold strategy relative to its mortgage-related securities, and does not intend to sell these securities and
will not be required to sell these securities before anticipated recovery of the unrealized losses on these securities. Further, the Company has adequate liquidity at December 31, 2012, with cash and cash equivalents totaling
$12.7 billion, a loan-to-deposit ratio of 14%, adequate access to short-term borrowing facilities and regulatory capital ratios in excess of “well capitalized” levels. Because the Company does not intend to sell these securities and
it is not “more likely than not” that the Company will be required to sell these securities, the Company recognized an impairment charge equal to the securities’ expected credit losses of $32 million in 2012. The expected credit
losses were measured as the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the securities. Further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the Company’s non-agency residential
mortgage-backed securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional impairment losses.

Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Loan Losses

The composition of loans
to banking clients by loan segment is as follows:

(1)

Loans are evaluated for impairment by loan segment.

The Company records an allowance for loan losses through a charge to earnings
based on management’s estimate of probable losses in the existing portfolio. Management reviews the allowance for loan losses quarterly, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the composition of the existing loan portfolio, past
loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio, as described in note “2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

Changes in the allowance for loan losses were as follows:

Included in the loan portfolio are nonaccrual
loans totaling $48 million and $52 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. There were no loans accruing interest that were contractually 90 days or more past due at December 31, 2012 or 2011. Nonperforming assets,
which include nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned, totaled $54 million and $56 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

As of December 31, 2012, Schwab Bank no longer originates First Mortgage loans
or HELOCs. In 2012, Schwab Bank launched a co-branded loan origination program for Schwab Bank clients (the Program) with Quicken Loans, Inc. (Quicken

). Pursuant to the
Program, Quicken Loans originates and services First Mortgage loans and HELOCs for Schwab Bank clients. Under the Program, Schwab Bank purchases certain First Mortgage loans and HELOCs that are originated by Quicken Loans. Schwab Bank sets the
underwriting guidelines and pricing for all loans it intends to purchase for its portfolio. The First Mortgage loans purchased under the Program are included in the first mortgages loan class as of December 31, 2012, in the table below.

The delinquency aging analysis by loan class is as follows:

In addition to monitoring the delinquency
characteristics, the Company monitors the credit quality of residential real estate mortgages and HELOCs by stratifying the portfolios by the year of origination, borrower FICO scores at origination (Origination FICO), updated borrower FICO scores
(Updated FICO), LTV ratios at origination (Origination LTV), and estimated current LTV ratios (Estimated Current LTV), as presented in the following tables. Borrowers’ FICO scores are provided by an independent third party credit reporting
service and were last updated in December 2012. The Origination LTV and Estimated Current LTV ratios for a HELOC include any first lien mortgage outstanding on the same property at the time of the HELOC’s origination. The Estimated Current LTV
for each loan is estimated by reference to a home price appreciation index.

In testing for potential impairment of
goodwill on April 1, 2012, the Company used a discounted cash flow model instead of the qualitative assessment methodology allowed by applicable accounting standards. As a result of this test, the fair values of the Company’s reporting
units, as indicated by a discounted cash flow model, substantially exceeded their fair values and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired in 2012. The Company did not recognize any goodwill impairment in 2011 or 2010.

Payables to Brokerage Clients

The principal source of funding for Schwab’s margin lending is cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which are included in payables to
brokerage clients. Cash balances in interest-bearing brokerage client accounts were $32.6 billion and $30.6 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The average rate paid on cash balances in interest-bearing brokerage
client accounts was 0.01% in 2012 and 2011.

14.

Borrowings

Long-term debt including unamortized debt discounts and premiums, where applicable, consists of the following:

CSC has a universal automatic shelf
registration statement (Shelf Registration Statement) on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), which enables CSC to issue debt, equity and other securities.

The Senior Notes outstanding at December 31, 2012, have maturities
ranging from 2015 to 2022 and fixed interest rates ranging from 0.850% to 4.45% with interest payable semi-annually.

In August 2012, CSC completed an exchange offer with certain eligible holders of its 4.950% Senior Notes due 2014 (Old Senior Notes), whereby Old Senior
Notes in an aggregate principal amount of $256 million were exchanged for the same aggregate principal amount of 3.225% Senior Notes due 2022 (New Senior Notes) and cash consideration of $19 million. Pursuant to an exchange and
registration rights agreement (Registration Rights Agreement), CSC filed an exchange registration with the SEC and launched an exchange offer on December 11, 2012, to allow the holders of the New Senior Notes to exchange such New Senior Notes
for an equal principal amount of notes with substantially identical terms, except that they are generally freely transferable under the Securities Act of 1933. The exchange offer was completed on January 23, 2013 and substantially all of the
New Senior Notes were exchanged. These notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.225% with interest payable semiannually.

On December 6, 2012, CSC issued $350 million of additional Senior Notes that mature in 2015 under the Shelf Registration Statement, which have a
fixed interest rate of 0.850% with interest payable semi-annually.

On December 21, 2012, CSC redeemed all of its remaining outstanding Old Senior Notes of $494 million. In connection with the redemption, CSC
paid the holders of the Old Senior Notes a make-whole premium of $31 million in addition to the $494 million principal payment. The make-whole premium was recorded in other revenue – net.

The Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series A (Medium-Term Notes) outstanding at
December 31, 2012, mature in 2017 and have a fixed interest rate of 6.375% with interest payable semi-annually.

CSC and Schwab Capital Trust I, a statutory trust formed under the laws of the State of Delaware (Trust), previously closed a public offering of
$300 million of the Trust’s fixed to floating-rate trust preferred securities. The proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were invested by the Trust in fixed to floating rate Junior Subordinated Notes issued by CSC, of
which $202 million remained outstanding at August 30, 2012. On August 31, 2012, CSC redeemed all of the outstanding fixed-to-floating rate trust preferred securities issued by the Trust for $207 million. The trust preferred
securities were redeemed, along with the common securities issued by the Trust and held by CSC, as a result of the concurrent redemption in

whole by CSC of the Junior Subordinated Notes held by the Trust which underlay the trust preferred securities. The redemption price represented 100% of the liquidation amount of each trust
preferred security, plus accumulated and unpaid distributions up to and including the redemption date.

Schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20-year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $95 million at December 31, 2012, is being reduced
by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of 12 years.

Annual maturities on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2012, are as follows:

CSC has authorization from its Board of
Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of $800 million. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may
vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes.
At December 31, 2012, the amount of Commercial Paper Notes outstanding was $300 million, which is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The amount outstanding was repaid on January 2, 2013. There were no borrowings of
Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2011.

CSC
maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of 11 banks, which is scheduled to expire in June 2013. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in June 2012. The funds under this
facility are available for general corporate purposes. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum
level of stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2012, the minimum level of stockholders’ equity required under this facility was $5.8 billion (CSC’s stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2012, was $9.6 billion).
There were no borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2012 or 2011.

To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling $842 million at December 31, 2012. CSC has direct access to
$642 million of these credit lines. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2012 or 2011.

To partially satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation, Schwab has unsecured standby LOCs with
five banks in favor of the Options Clearing Corporation aggregating $325 million at December 31, 2012. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab
satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $74 million. There were no funds drawn
under any of these LOCs at December 31, 2012 or 2011.

Commitments and Contingencies

Operating leases and other commitments:

The Company has non-cancelable operating leases for office space and equipment. Future annual minimum
rental commitments under these leases, net of contractual subleases, at December 31, 2012, are as follows:

Certain leases contain provisions for renewal
options, purchase options, and rent escalations based on increases in certain costs incurred by the lessor. Rent expense was $203 million, $187 million, and $168 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Purchase obligations:

The Company has purchase obligations for
services such as advertising and marketing, telecommunications, professional services, and hardware- and software-related agreements. At December 31, 2012, the Company has purchase obligations as follows:

Guarantees and indemnifications:

In
the normal course of business, the Company provides certain indemnifications (i.e., protection against damage or loss) to counterparties in connection with the disposition of certain of its assets. Such indemnifications are generally standard
contractual terms with various expiration dates and typically relate to title to the assets transferred, ownership of intellectual property rights (e.g., patents), accuracy of financial statements, compliance with laws and regulations, failure to
pay, satisfy or discharge any liability, or to defend claims, as well as errors, omissions, and misrepresentations. The maximum potential future liability under these indemnifications cannot be estimated. The Company has not recorded a liability for
these indemnifications and believes that the occurrence of events that would trigger payments under these agreements is remote.

The Company has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by various clearing houses. The clearing houses establish margin
requirements on these transactions. The Company partially satisfies the margin requirements by arranging unsecured standby LOCs, in favor of the clearing houses, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate face
amount of these LOCs totaled $325 million. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs in favor of
these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2012, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $74 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs at December 31, 2012.

The Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and
exchanges under standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. Under the agreements, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other
members would be required to meet shortfalls. The

- 76 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

Company’s liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the cash and securities it has posted as collateral. However, the potential requirement for the Company to
make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these guarantees.

Legal contingencies:

The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business, including arbitrations, class actions and
other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies.

The Company believes it has strong defenses in all significant matters
currently pending and is contesting liability and any damages claimed. Nevertheless, some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards, including penalties, injunctions or other relief, and the Company may also determine to settle a
matter because of the uncertainty and risks of litigation. Described below are certain matters in which there is a reasonable possibility that a material loss could be incurred or where the matter may otherwise be of significant interest to
stockholders. With respect to all other pending matters, based on current information and consultation with counsel, it does not appear that the outcome of any such matter could be material to the financial condition, operating results or cash flows
of the Company. However, predicting the outcome of a litigation or regulatory matter is inherently difficult, requiring significant judgment and evaluation of various factors, including the procedural status of the matter and any recent
developments; prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases; available defenses, including potential opportunities to dispose of a case on the merits or procedural grounds before trial (e.g., motions to dismiss or for summary
judgment); the progress of fact discovery; the opinions of counsel and experts regarding potential damages; potential opportunities for settlement and the status of any settlement discussions; and potential insurance coverage and indemnification.
Often, as in the case of the Auction Rate Securities Regulatory Inquiries and Total Bond Market Fund Litigation matters described below, it is not possible to reasonably estimate potential liability, if any, or a range of potential liability until
the matter is closer to resolution – pending, for example, further proceedings, the outcome of key motions or appeals, or discussions among the parties. Numerous issues may have to be developed, such as discovery of important factual matters
and determination of threshold legal issues, which may include novel or unsettled questions of law. Reserves are established or adjusted or further disclosure and estimates of potential loss are provided as the matter progresses and more information
becomes available.

Auction Rate Securities Regulatory
Inquiries

: Schwab has been responding to industry wide inquiries from federal and state regulators regarding sales of auction rate securities to clients who were unable to sell their holdings when the normal auction process for those securities
froze unexpectedly in February 2008. On August 17, 2009, a civil complaint was filed against Schwab in New York state court by the Attorney General of the State of New York (NYAG) alleging material misrepresentations and omissions by Schwab
regarding the risks of auction rate securities, and seeking restitution, disgorgement, penalties and other relief, including repurchase of securities held in client accounts. As reflected in a statement issued August 17, 2009, Schwab has
responded that the allegations are without merit, and has been contesting all charges. By order dated October 24, 2011, the court granted Schwab’s motion to dismiss the complaint with prejudice. The NYAG has appealed to the Appellate
Division, where the case is currently pending.

Total Bond
Market Fund Litigation

: On August 28, 2008, a class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on behalf of investors in the Schwab Total Bond Market Fund™ (Northstar lawsuit). The
lawsuit, which alleges violations of state law and federal securities law in connection with the fund’s investment policy, names Schwab Investments (registrant and issuer of the fund’s shares) and CSIM as defendants. Allegations include
that the fund improperly deviated from its stated investment objectives by investing in collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and investing more than 25% of fund assets in CMOs and mortgage-backed securities without obtaining a shareholder
vote. Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory and rescission damages, unspecified equitable and injunctive relief, costs and attorneys’ fees. Plaintiffs’ federal securities law claim and certain of plaintiffs’ state law claims were
dismissed in proceedings before the court and following a successful petition by defendants to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. On August 8, 2011, the court dismissed plaintiffs’ remaining claims with prejudice. Plaintiffs have again
appealed to the Ninth Circuit, where the case is currently pending.

optionsXpress Regulatory Matters

: optionsXpress entities and individual employees have been responding to certain pending regulatory matters which
predate the Company’s acquisition of optionsXpress. On April 16, 2012, optionsXpress, Inc. was

charged by the SEC in an administrative proceeding alleging violations of the firm’s close-out obligations under SEC Regulation SHO (short sale delivery rules) in connection with certain
customer trading activity. Trial in the administrative proceeding commenced September 5, 2012. The Company disputes the allegations and is contesting the charges. Separately, on April 19, 2012, the SEC instituted an administrative
proceeding alleging violations of the broker-dealer registration requirements by an unregistered optionsXpress entity. On September 5, 2012, the administrative law judge hearing the case ruled on summary disposition that applicable registration
requirements were violated. Certain other issues, including relief, remain to be determined at trial. The Company continues to dispute the allegations and is contesting the charges. The Company recorded a contingent liability associated with the two
separate matters, which was not material at December 31, 2012.

16.

Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk, or Market Risk

Securities lending:

The Company loans client securities temporarily to other brokers in connection with its securities
lending activities and receives cash as collateral for the securities loaned. Increases in security prices may cause the fair value of the securities loaned to exceed the amount of cash received as collateral. In the event the counterparty to these
transactions does not return the loaned securities or provide additional cash collateral, the Company may be exposed to the risk of acquiring the securities at prevailing market prices in order to satisfy its client obligations. The Company
mitigates this risk by requiring credit approvals for counterparties, monitoring the fair value of securities loaned, and requiring additional cash as collateral when necessary. The fair value of client securities pledged in securities lending
transactions to other broker-dealers was $852 million and $783 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Additionally, the Company borrows securities from other broker-dealers to fulfill short sales by clients. The fair
value of these borrowed securities was $121 million and $44 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Client trade settlement:

The Company is obligated to settle transactions with brokers and other financial institutions even if the Company’s
clients fail to meet their obligations to the Company. Clients are required to complete their transactions on settlement date, generally three business days after the trade date. If clients do not fulfill their contractual obligations, the Company
may incur losses. The Company has established procedures to reduce this risk by requiring deposits from clients in excess of amounts prescribed by regulatory requirements for certain types of trades, and therefore the potential to make payments
under these client transactions is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these transactions.

Margin lending:

The Company provides margin loans to its clients which are collateralized by securities in their brokerage accounts and may be liable for the margin requirement of its client margin
securities transactions. As clients write options or sell securities short, the Company may incur losses if the clients do not fulfill their obligations and the collateral in client accounts is insufficient to fully cover losses which clients may
incur from these strategies. To mitigate this risk, the Company monitors required margin levels and requires clients to deposit additional collateral, or reduce positions to meet minimum collateral requirements.

Clients with margin loans have agreed to allow the Company to pledge
collateralized securities in their brokerage accounts in accordance with federal regulations. Under such regulations, the Company was allowed to pledge securities with a fair value of $17.1 billion and $14.7 billion at December 31,
2012 and 2011, respectively. The fair value of client securities pledged to fulfill the short sales of its clients was $1.2 billion at both December 31, 2012 and 2011. The fair value of client securities pledged to fulfill the
Company’s proprietary short sales, which resulted from facilitating clients’ dividend reinvestment elections, was $109 million and $101 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company has also pledged a
portion of its securities owned in order to fulfill the short sales of clients and in connection with securities lending transactions to other broker-dealers. The Company may also pledge client securities to fulfill client margin requirements for
open option contracts established with the OCC. The fair value of these pledged securities to the OCC was $1.9 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Resale and repurchase agreements:

Schwab enters into collateralized
resale agreements principally with other broker-dealers, which could result in losses in the event the counterparty fails to purchase the securities held as collateral for the cash advanced and the fair value of the securities declines. To mitigate
this risk, Schwab requires that the counterparty deliver

- 78 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

securities to a custodian, to be held as collateral, with a fair value in excess of the resale price. Schwab also sets standards for the credit quality of the counterparty, monitors the fair
value of the underlying securities as compared to the related receivable, including accrued interest, and requires additional collateral where deemed appropriate. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value of collateral received in
connection with resale agreements that are available to be repledged or sold was $19.7 billion and $18.3 billion, respectively. Schwab utilizes the collateral provided under repurchase agreements to meet obligations under broker-dealer
client protection rules, which place limitations on its ability to access such segregated securities. For Schwab to repledge or sell this collateral, it would be required to deposit cash and/or securities of an equal amount into its segregated
reserve bank accounts in order to meet its segregated cash and investment requirement.

Concentration risk:

The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions of financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in
securities of a single issuer or industry. For discussion on the Company’s exposure to concentration risk relating to residential mortgage-backed securities, see note “6 – Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to
Maturity.”

The Company’s investments in corporate debt
securities and commercial paper totaled $8.0 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. These securities are included in
securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned. At December 31, 2011, the Company held $867 million
of corporate debt securities issued by financial institutions and guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. At December 31, 2012, the Company did not hold any of these securities.

The Company’s loans to banking clients include $6.0 billion and
$5.6 billion of adjustable rate first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company’s adjustable rate mortgages have initial fixed interest rates for three to ten years and
interest rates that adjust annually thereafter. At December 31, 2012, approximately 50% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest-only payment terms. At December 31, 2012, the interest rates on approximately 65% of these
interest-only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Company’s mortgage loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. At December 31, 2012, 45% of the
residential real estate mortgages and 50% of the HELOC balances were secured by properties which are located in California. At December 31, 2011, 44% of the residential real estate mortgages and 50% of the HELOC balances were secured by
properties which are located in California.

The Company also has
exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. This concentration risk is mitigated by collateral arrangements that require the fair value of such
collateral exceeds the amounts loaned.

The Company has indirect
exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S.
Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. The fair value of U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $19.7 billion and
$18.3 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Commitments to extend credit:

Schwab Bank enters into commitments to extend credit to banking clients. Schwab Bank also has commitments to purchase certain First Mortgage loans and HELOCs under the
Program with Quicken Loans, which began in 2012. The credit risk associated with these commitments varies depending on the creditworthiness of the client and the value of any collateral expected to be held. Collateral requirements vary by type of
loan. At December 31, 2012, the Company had commitments to purchase First Mortgage loans of $867 million. Schwab Bank also has commitments to extend credit related to its clients’ unused HELOCs, personal loans secured by securities,
and other lines of credit, which totaled $5.4 billion and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Fair Values of Assets and Liabilities

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

The Company issues shares for stock options and restricted stock awards from treasury stock. At
December 31, 2012, the Company was authorized to grant up to 45 million common shares under its existing stock incentive plans. Additionally, at December 31, 2012, the Company had 43 million shares reserved for future issuance
under its employee stock purchase plan.

As of December 31,
2012, there was $191 million of total unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to outstanding stock options, restricted stock awards, and restricted stock units, which is expected to be recognized through 2016 with a
remaining weighted-average service period of 2.8 years.

Stock
Option Plan

Options are granted for the purchase of shares
of common stock at an exercise price not less than market value on the date of grant, and expire within seven or ten years from the date of grant. Options generally vest annually over a three- to five-year period from the date of grant. Certain
options were granted at an exercise price above the market value of common stock on the date of grant (i.e., premium-priced options).

The Company’s stock option activity is summarized below:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the table
above represents the difference between CSC’s closing stock price and the exercise price of each in-the-money option on the last trading day of the period presented.

Information on stock options granted and exercised is presented below:

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

Management uses a binomial option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted. The
binomial model takes into account the contractual term of the stock option, expected volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of publicly-traded options on CSC’s stock.
Dividend yield is based on the average historical CSC dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term similar to the contractual term of the option. Management uses
historical option exercise data, which includes employee termination data to estimate the probability of future option exercises. Management uses the Black-Scholes model to solve for the expected life of options valued with the binomial model
presented below. The assumptions used to value the Company’s options granted during the years presented and their expected lives were as follows:

Restricted Stock Units

Restricted stock units are awards that entitle the holder to receive shares
of CSC’s common stock following a vesting period. Restricted stock units are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest annually over a three- to five-year period, while some vest based upon the Company achieving certain financial or
other measures. The fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The grant date fair value is amortized to compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite
service period. The fair value of the restricted stock units that vested during each of the years 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $30 million, $13 million, and $6 million, respectively.

The Company’s restricted stock units activity is summarized below:

Retirement Plan

Upon completing three months of consecutive service,
employees of the Company can participate in the Company’s qualified retirement plan, the SchwabPlan

®

Retirement Savings and Investment Plan. The Company may match certain employee contributions or make additional contributions to this plan at its discretion. The Company’s total contribution expense was $59 million, $53 million, and
$50 million in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company’s deferred compensation plan for officers permits participants to defer the receipt of certain cash compensation. The deferred
compensation liability was $127 million and $128 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company’s deferred compensation plan for non-employee directors permits participants to defer receipt of all or a portion
of their director fees and to receive either a grant of stock options, or upon ceasing to serve as a director, the number of shares of CSC’s common stock that would have resulted from investing the deferred fee amount into CSC’s common
stock.

Earnings Per Common Share

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to
common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The computation of diluted EPS is similar to the computation of basic EPS except that the denominator is increased to include the number of additional
common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been issued. Dilutive potential common shares include the effect of outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock awards and units. EPS under the basic
and diluted computations is as follows:

Antidilutive stock options and restricted stock awards excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS totaled 74 million, 63 million, and
52 million shares in 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.

Regulatory Requirements

CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab
Bank, CSC’s depository institution subsidiary, is a federal savings bank. CSC is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve) and Schwab Bank is subject to supervision and
regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the OCC). CSC is currently not subject to specific statutory capital requirements, however CSC is required to serve as a source of strength for Schwab Bank. Under the “Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,” CSC will be subject to new minimum leverage and minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements that will be set by the Federal Reserve that are at least as stringent as the current requirements
generally applicable to insured depository institutions.

Schwab
Bank is subject to regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws, including regulatory capital guidelines. Among other things, these requirements also restrict and govern the terms of affiliate
transactions, such as extensions of credit and repayment of loans between Schwab Bank and CSC or CSC’s other subsidiaries. In addition, Schwab Bank is required to provide notice to and may be required to obtain approval of the OCC and the
Federal Reserve to declare dividends to CSC. The federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and
appoint a conservator or receiver. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, Schwab Bank could be subject to restrictive actions if it were to fall within one of the lowest three of five capital categories. Schwab Bank is required to maintain minimum
capital levels as specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels could result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2012, CSC and Schwab Bank met the capital level requirements.

The regulatory capital and ratios for Schwab Bank are as follows:

N/A Not
applicable.

Based on its regulatory capital ratios at
December 31, 2012 and 2011, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized (the highest category) pursuant to banking regulatory guidelines. There are no conditions or events since December 31, 2012, that management believes have changed
Schwab Bank’s capital category.

The Federal Reserve requires
Schwab Bank to maintain reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Bank based on certain deposit levels. Schwab Bank’s average reserve requirement was $1.1 billion in both 2012 and 2011.

CSC’s principal U.S. broker-dealers are Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc.
optionsXpress, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of optionsXpress. Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. are both subject to Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Uniform Net Capital Rule). Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. compute net
capital under the alternative method permitted by the Uniform Net Capital Rule. This method requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from client transactions or a minimum
dollar requirement ($250,000 for Schwab), which is based on the type of business conducted by the broker-dealer. Under the alternative method, a broker-dealer may not

repay subordinated borrowings, pay cash dividends, or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in a net capital amount of less than 5%
of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.

optionsXpress, Inc. is also subject to Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17 (Reg. 1.17) under the Commodity Exchange Act, which also requires the maintenance of minimum net capital.
optionsXpress, Inc., as a futures commission merchant, is required to maintain minimum net capital equal to the greater of its net capital requirement under Reg. 1.17 ($1 million), or the sum of 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all
positions carried in client accounts and 8% of the total risk margin requirements for all positions carried in non-client accounts (as defined in Reg. 1.17).

Segment Information

Operating segments are defined as components of a company
in which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Company structures its operating segments
according to its clients and the services provided to those clients. The Company’s two reportable segments are Investor Services and Institutional Services.

The Investor Services segment provides retail brokerage and banking services
to individual investors. The Institutional Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors. The Institutional Services segment also provides retirement plan services, specialty brokerage
services, and mutual fund clearing services, and supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds and collective trust funds on third-party platforms. Banking revenues and expenses are allocated to the Company’s two segments based
on which segment services the client.

The accounting policies of
the segments are the same as those described in note “2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following table. For the computation of its
segment information, the Company utilizes an activity-based costing model to allocate traditional income statement line item expenses (e.g., compensation and benefits, depreciation and amortization, and professional services) to the business
activities driving segment expenses (e.g., client service, opening new accounts, or business development) and a funds transfer pricing methodology to allocate certain revenues.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, or as Noted)

The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis, excluding items such as
significant nonrecurring gains, impairment charges on non-financial assets, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and significant restructuring and other charges. Segment assets and liabilities are not used for evaluating segment performance
or in deciding how to allocate resources to segments. However, capital expenditures are used in resource allocation and are therefore disclosed. There are no revenues from transactions with other segments within the Company. Capital expenditures are
reported gross, and are not net of proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.

Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following table:

(1)

Unallocated amount includes a pre-tax gain of $70 million relating to a confidential resolution of a vendor dispute in 2012.

(2)

Unallocated amount primarily includes class action litigation and regulatory reserves of $320 million and money market mutual fund charges of
$132 million in 2010.

Fees received from
Schwab’s proprietary mutual funds represented 10% of the Company’s net revenues in both 2012 and 2011, and 14% in 2010. Except for Schwab’s proprietary mutual funds, which are considered a single client for purposes of this
computation, no single client accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s net revenues in 2012, 2011, or 2010. Substantially all of the Company’s revenues and assets are generated or located in the U.S. The percentage of Schwab’s
total client accounts located in California was 23% at December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010.

In the first quarter of 2013, the Company realigned its reportable segments as a result of recent organizational changes. The Institutional segment will be renamed to Advisor Services. The Retirement Plan
Services, Corporate Brokerage Retirement Products (formerly part of Retirement Business Services), and Corporate Brokerage Services business units will be reallocated to the Investor Services segment. The Company will recast the segment information
based on this realignment in the first quarter of 2013.

Subsequent Events

The Company has evaluated the impact of events that have
occurred subsequent to December 31, 2012, through the date the consolidated financial statements were filed with the SEC. Based on this evaluation, other than as recorded or disclosed within these consolidated financial statements and related
notes, the Company has determined none of these events were required to be recognized or disclosed.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The Charles Schwab
Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of The Charles Schwab Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the
three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of the Company on page F-2. We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2012, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements
and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on
Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as
we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial
reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness
of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of The Charles Schwab Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2012, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
