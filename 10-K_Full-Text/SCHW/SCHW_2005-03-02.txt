                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION


                                     PART I


Item 1. Business

                           General Corporate Overview

     The Charles  Schwab  Corporation  (CSC),  headquartered  in San  Francisco,
California,  and its subsidiaries  (collectively referred to as the Company, and
primarily  located in San Francisco  except as indicated),  was  incorporated in
1986 and engages,  through its subsidiaries,  in securities brokerage,  banking,
and  related  financial  services.  Client  assets  totaled  $1.081 trillion  in
7.3 million  active client  accounts(a) at December 31,  2004.  Charles Schwab &
Co.,  Inc.  (Schwab),  incorporated  in 1971 and entered the discount  brokerage
business in 1974, is a securities broker-dealer with 236 domestic branch offices
in 43 states, as well as a branch in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. U.S. Trust
Corporation  (USTC,  and  with  its  subsidiaries  collectively  referred  to as
U.S. Trust),  which was  acquired  in 2000 and is located in New York City,  New
York, is a wealth  management firm that through its  subsidiaries  also provides
fiduciary  services and private  banking  services with 37 offices in 15 states.
Charles  Schwab  Bank,  N.A.  (Schwab  Bank),  is a retail bank located in Reno,
Nevada which commenced operations in April 2003.
     Other  subsidiaries  of CSC include Charles Schwab  Investment  Management,
Inc. (CSIM), CyberTrader, Inc. (CyberTrader),  located in Austin, Texas, and The
Charles Schwab Trust Company (CSTC). CSIM is the investment advisor for Schwab's
proprietary  mutual funds. The Company refers to certain funds for which CSIM is
the investment advisor as the SchwabFunds(R). CyberTrader, which was acquired in
2000, is an electronic  trading technology and brokerage firm providing services
to highly active,  online traders.  CSTC serves as trustee for employee  benefit
plans, primarily 401(k) plans.
     On  October 29,  2004,  the  Company  sold its  capital  markets  business,
consisting of the  partnership  interests of Schwab Capital Markets L.P. and all
of  the  outstanding   capital  stock  of  SoundView   Technology   Group,  Inc.
(collectively  referred to as Schwab  Soundview  Capital  Markets,  or SSCM). In
2003, the Company  substantially  exited from its international  operations with
the sales of its U.K.  brokerage  subsidiary,  Charles  Schwab  Europe,  and its
investment  in Aitken  Campbell,  a  market-making  joint venture in the U.K. In
2001, USTC sold its Corporate Trust business.  For further  information on these
transactions,  see "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements - 5. Discontinued  Operations,  6. Business
Acquisitions and Divestitures, and 4. Sale of Corporate Trust Business."
     As of December 31, 2004, the Company had full-time, part-time and temporary
employees,  and  persons  employed  on a  contract  basis that  represented  the
equivalent of 14,200 full-time employees.
     The Company provides  financial  services to individuals and  institutional
clients through three segments - Individual  Investor,  Institutional  Investor,
and U.S. Trust.  The Individual  Investor  segment includes the Company's retail
brokerage and banking  operations.  The Institutional  Investor segment provides
custodial,  trading and  support  services to  independent  investment  advisors
(IAs), serves company 401(k) plan sponsors and third-party  administrators,  and
supports company stock option plans. The U.S. Trust segment provides investment,
wealth  management,   custody,   fiduciary,  and  private  banking  services  to
individual and institutional  clients. For financial  information by segment for
the  three  years  ended  December 31,  2004,  as  well as a  discussion  of the
previously-reported  Capital Markets segment, see "Item 8 - Financial Statements
and  Supplementary  Data - Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  - 26.
Segment Information."

                  Business Strategy and Competitive Environment

     Consistent  with the Company's  vision of being the most useful and ethical
provider of financial services in the world, its primary strategy is to meet the
financial  services needs of individual  investors and the  independent  IAs who
serve them. In pursuit of this strategy,  the Company has refocused on improving
service  for these  clients  and  building  stronger  relationships  with  them,
simplified  its  organizational   structure  and  client  offers,   reduced  its
commission rates and fees, and exited the capital markets business.
     Another important element of the Company's strategy is its ongoing emphasis
on combining  people and  technology in ways that  facilitate  the delivery of a
full range of  investment  services at great  value.  People  provide the client
focus  and  personal  touch  that are  essential  in  serving  investors,  while
technology  helps  create  services  that  are  scalable  and  consistent.  This
combination  helps the Company to deliver  useful,  relevant,  and  value-priced
offerings  to a broad  array of  clients -  independent  investors,  individuals
investing through retirement plans,  individuals seeking advice, active traders,
and  independent  IAs - and compete for a large  percentage  of the trillions of
investable  wealth in the U.S. To attract and serve these  clients,  the Company
offers a broad and growing array of investment, banking and lending products.
     The Company's  competition in serving independent investors includes a wide
range of brokerage and asset management  firms. In serving these investors,  the
Company  offers  branch,  telephonic  and  online  service  capabilities  and

                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION


an extensive product line.  Schwab's network of branches and regional  telephone
service  centers is staffed with trained and experienced  financial  consultants
focused on building  and  sustaining  client  relationships.  In  addition,  the
Company  offers the ability to meet client trading and/or advice needs through a
single ongoing  relationship,  even as those needs change over time, and it also
provides access to automated online and telephonic channels to provide quick and
efficient access to an extensive array of information,  research,  tools,  trade
execution,  and administrative  services.  Individuals  investing for retirement
through  401(k) plans can take  advantage of the Company's  bundled  offering of
multiple investment choices, education and third-party advice.
     Competition  in serving  investors  looking  for an  advisory  relationship
involves  a variety  of  traditional  brokerage,  asset  management,  and wealth
advisory firms.  Management believes that the Company's competitive strengths in
this arena revolve  around its ability to provide  clients with an  individually
tailored  solution  -  ranging  from  occasional  consultations  to  an  ongoing
relationship with a Schwab  Consultant,  IA, or U.S. Trust  advisor - versus the
more fragmented offerings of other firms.
     For active  traders,  the Company  primarily  competes with  deep-discount,
online-focused   firms  as  well  as  certain  larger  financial   institutions.
Management believes the Company can continue to attract these clients because it
combines  highly  competitive  pricing and expert tools with  extensive  service
capabilities - including experienced, knowledgeable teams of trading specialists
and integrated product  offerings.  The Company also offers these clients access
to all of the other tools, products, and advice available at Schwab to help them
manage their diverse and complex portfolios.
     In the IA  arena,  the  Company  competes  with  institutional  custodians,
traditional and discount brokers, banks and trust companies. Management believes
that  its  Schwab  Institutional(R)  unit can  maintain  its  market  leadership
position through a combination of superior service,  scale, dedicated resources,
and extensive familiarity with the industry. Schwab Institutional also leverages
technology  to  provide  IAs with the  tools and  support  they need to grow and
manage their practices efficiently.
     Overall,  management  believes  that the  Company's  multi-channel  service
delivery model of branch,  phone and internet access is essential to its ability
to  compete  effectively  with the wide  variety  of  financial  services  firms
striving  to attract  client  relationships  and assets  across the  spectrum of
investors.  Under this  model,  the Company  can offer  personalized  service at
competitive  prices while giving clients the choice of where,  when and how they
do business with the firm.  Another important aspect of the Company's ability to
compete is its ongoing focus on efficiency and productivity, as lower costs give
the Company greater  pricing  flexibility.  Management  believes that this focus
remains  important in light of the recent  competitive  environment,  in which a
number of competitors  reduced online trading commission rates and account fees.
Additionally,   the  Company's  nationwide  marketing  effort  is  an  important
competitive  tool because it reinforces the  attributes of the  Schwab(R),  U.S.
Trust(R) and  CyberTrader(R)  brands,  thereby  leveraging  the local  marketing
endeavors of the 3,700 Company staff in the offices and service centers.
     In addition to competition from other financial services firms, the Company
faces competition for quality professionals and other personnel, and its ability
to continue to compete  effectively  will depend upon its ability to attract new
employees  and  retain  existing  employees  while  managing  compensation.  The
Company's business can also be significantly affected by the general environment
- -  economic,   corporate,   securities   market,   regulatory  and  geopolitical
developments  all play a role in  client  asset  valuations,  trading  activity,
interest rates and overall investor engagement. For a discussion of the business
environment faced by the Company in 2004, see "Item 7 - Management's  Discussion
and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations - Description  of
Business - Overview."


                              Products and Services

     The  Company  offers a broad  range of  products  to address  its  clients'
varying  investment  and financial  needs.  Examples of these product  offerings
include:

     Independent  Investors.   For  investors  who  make  their  own  investment
decisions,  the Company offers research,  analytic tools,  performance  reports,
market  analysis,  and educational  material.  Clients looking for more guidance

designed to help clients achieve better  investment  outcomes.  As an example of
such tools, Schwab Equity Ratings(R) is a quantitative  model-based stock rating
system which  provides all clients with ratings on  approximately  3,000 stocks,
assigning  each equity a single grade:  A, B, C, D, or F. Stocks are rated based
on specific factors relating to fundamentals, valuation, momentum, and risk, and
ranked so that the  number of 'buy  consideration'  ratings - As and Bs - equals
the number of 'sell consideration' ratings - Ds and Fs.

     Advised  Investors.  The Company seeks to provide  clients with  customized
advice that is uncomplicated  and not influenced by commissions on transactions.
The Company's approach to advice is based on long-term investment strategies and

                                   Regulation

     CSC is a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company
subject to  supervision  and  regulation by the Federal  Reserve Board under the
Bank  Holding  Company Act of 1956,  as amended.  CSC's  depository  institution
subsidiaries, including Schwab Bank and affiliates of U.S. Trust, are subject to
regulation  under federal and state law,  including  supervision  by federal and
state  banking   authorities.   For  a  discussion   of  bank  holding   company
requirements,  see "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements - 22. Regulatory Requirements."
     The  securities  industry  in the United  States is  subject  to  extensive
regulation  under  both  federal  and state  laws.  Schwab and  CyberTrader  are
registered as broker-dealers with the SEC, the fifty states, and the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico. Schwab and CSIM are registered as investment  advisors
with the  Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (SEC).  Additionally,  Schwab is
regulated by the Commodities  Futures Trading  Commission (CFTC) with respect to
the futures and  commodities  trading  activities it conducts as an  introducing
broker.
     Much  of  the   regulation  of   broker-dealers   has  been   delegated  to
self-regulatory  organizations  (SROs), namely the national securities exchanges
and the Municipal  Securities  Rulemaking Board (MSRB).  Schwab is a member of a
number of national  securities  exchanges and is  consequently  subject to their
rules and regulations.  The primary regulators of Schwab and CyberTrader are the
National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) and, for municipal securities,
the MSRB.  The CFTC has  designated the National  Futures  Association  (NFA) as
Schwab's primary regulator for futures and commodities trading  activities.  The
Company's  business is also subject to oversight by  regulatory  bodies in other
countries in which the Company operates.
     The principal purpose of regulating  broker-dealers and investment advisors
is the  protection of clients and the  securities  markets.  The  regulations to
which  broker-dealers  and investment  advisors are subject cover all aspects of
the  securities  business,  including,  among  other  things,  sales and trading
practices,  publication of research,  margin  lending,  uses and  safekeeping of
clients' funds and securities,  capital  adequacy,  recordkeeping and reporting,
fee  arrangements,  disclosure  to  clients,  fiduciary  duties owed to advisory
clients, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.
     New  legislation,  rule  changes,  or  changes  in  the  interpretation  or
enforcement  of  existing  federal,  state  and SRO rules  and  regulations  may
directly   affect  the  operation  and   profitability   of  the  Company.   The
profitability  of the Company  could also be  affected by rules and  regulations
which impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes
to the laws  governing  taxation,  electronic  commerce,  and security of client
data.
     The Company is subject to claims,  lawsuits,  regulatory  examinations  and
enforcement proceedings in the ordinary course of business,  which can result in
settlements,  awards, censures, fines, cease and desist orders, or suspension or
expulsion of an affiliate, its officers, or employees.
     As registered broker-dealers, certain subsidiaries of CSC, including Schwab
are  subject  to SEC  Rule  15c3-1  (the  Net  Capital  Rule)  and  related  SRO
requirements.  The CFTC and NFA also  impose net capital  requirements.  The Net
Capital Rule specifies minimum capital  requirements that are intended to ensure
the general  financial  soundness and liquidity of  broker-dealers.  Because CSC
itself is not a registered  broker-dealer,  it is not subject to the Net Capital
Rule.  However,  if Schwab failed to maintain  specified  levels of net capital,
such failure would constitute a default by CSC under certain debt covenants.
     The Net Capital Rule limits broker-dealers'  ability to transfer capital to
parent  companies  and other  affiliates.  Compliance  with the Net Capital Rule
could limit Schwab's  operations and its ability to repay  subordinated  debt to
CSC,  which in turn could limit CSC's ability to repay debt,  pay cash dividends
and purchase  shares of its outstanding  stock.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings

     CSC and its  subsidiaries  have been  named as  parties  in  various  legal
actions,  which include the matters described below. It is inherently  difficult
to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, particularly in cases in which
claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages,  and a substantial  judgment,
settlement or penalty could be material to the Company's operating results for a
particular  future period,  depending on the Company's  results for that period.
However,  based on current information,  it is the opinion of management,  after
consultation with counsel,  that the resolution of these matters will not have a
material  adverse  impact on the financial  condition,  results of operations or
cash flows of the Company.

                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION


     Mutual Funds  Litigation:  Since November 2003,  multiple  purported  class
action and  derivative  lawsuits have been filed against the Company and certain
affiliates,  officers and  directors  in  connection  with alleged  improper and
illegal mutual fund trading practices.
     Two  stockholders'  derivative  actions were filed in  California  Superior
Court in San  Francisco in March and April 2004 against CSC and sixteen  current
or former CSC directors.  These actions allege that the directors breached their
fiduciary duties to Schwab and its stockholders by allegedly failing to maintain
adequate  controls  to prevent  improper  mutual  fund  trading  practices.  The
lawsuits seek the recovery of  unspecified  compensatory  damages and attorneys'
fees from the named individuals, along with the return of all salaries and other
remuneration  they received as directors.  CSC is named as a nominal  defendant,
although no damages are sought against CSC.
     Several  lawsuits  filed in federal  court  relating to mutual fund trading
practices  have been  consolidated  in U.S.  District  Court in Maryland for the
purpose of consolidated and coordinated pre-trial  proceedings.  Lead plaintiffs
and  lead  counsel  have  been   appointed,   and  lead  plaintiffs  have  filed
consolidated and amended complaints in such actions as follows:
     During  September 2004,  purported  Excelsior(R) Fund  shareholders filed a
consolidated  amended class action complaint  against USTC,  United States Trust
Company of New York (U.S. Trust NY), Schwab and the Excelsior Funds.  Plaintiffs
allege  that the  defendants  breached  fiduciary  duties and  violated  various
federal  securities  laws by  permitting  market  timing and late trading in the
Excelsior Funds and by failing to disclose such timing in the fund prospectuses.
Plaintiffs seek unspecified  compensatory and punitive damages, and disgorgement
of investment advisory fees.
     During September 2004,  certain  Excelsior Fund  shareholders  also filed a
consolidated amended derivative action on behalf of nominal defendants Excelsior
Funds Inc., Excelsior Funds Trust, and Excelsior Tax Exempt Funds Inc. (the Fund
Companies),   against  CSC,  USTC,   U.S. Trust  NY,  U.S. Trust  Company,  N.A.
(U.S. Trust NA), various current and former officers,  directors and trustees of
the  Excelsior  Funds (the  U.S. Trust  and  Excelsior  Defendants)  and various
third-party  defendants.  Plaintiffs  allege that the  U.S. Trust  and Excelsior
Defendants  breached  fiduciary duties and violated  federal  securities laws by
permitting  market timing in the Excelsior Funds and by failing to disclose such
timing  in the  fund  prospectuses.  Plaintiffs  seek,  on  behalf  of the  Fund
Companies,  unspecified  monetary  damages,  as well as removal of the Excelsior
Fund  directors,  removal of U.S. Trust  as advisor to the funds,  rescission of
U.S. Trust's  investment  advisory contracts with the funds, and disgorgement of
management fees and compensation relating to the funds.
     During October 2004, certain CSC shareholders filed a consolidated  amended
class  action  complaint  on behalf of  purchasers  of CSC stock,  against  CSC,
Schwab,  U.S. Trust NA,  U.S. Trust NY and current and former CSC and U.S. Trust
officers and directors Charles Schwab,  Alan Weber, David Pottruck,  and Jeffrey
Maurer.  Plaintiffs allege that the defendants  violated federal securities laws
by  failing  to  disclose  alleged  improper  mutual  fund  trading   practices.
Plaintiffs seek unspecified compensatory damages.
     During  October  2004,  Schwab was named in three  additional  class action
lawsuits   brought  on  behalf  of  shareholders   in  the  Invesco,   MFS,  and
Pilgrim-Baxter  mutual fund  families.  The  lawsuits,  which were filed in U.S.
District  Court  in  Maryland,  allege  that  Schwab  and  more  than  38  other
broker-dealers,  banks, and other financial intermediaries acted as conduits for
market-timing  and late-trading  activity by disregarding  excessive  trading on
their platforms and  facilitating  such activity.  Plaintiffs  seek  unspecified
compensatory and punitive damages.
     The Company  believes it has strong  defenses and is vigorously  contesting
each of the above mentioned claims.

     Mutual  Funds  Regulatory  Matters:  The  Company  has been  responding  to
inquiries  and  subpoenas  from  federal  and  state  authorities   relating  to
circumstances  in which a small  number of parties  were  permitted to engage in
short-term trading of certain Excelsior Funds through  U.S. Trust.  Although the
Company  is unable  to  predict  the  ultimate  outcome  of these  matters,  any
enforcement actions instituted as a result of the investigations may subject the
Company to fines,  penalties or other  administrative  remedies.  The Company is
cooperating  with  regulators,  and has  taken  steps to  enhance  its  existing
policies and procedures to further discourage, detect, and prevent market timing
and late trading.

     SoundView  Technology Group, Inc.  (SoundView)  Litigation:  As part of the
sale of SoundView to UBS  Securities  LLC and UBS  Americas  Inc.  (collectively
referred  to as UBS),  the  Company  agreed to  indemnify  UBS for any  expenses
associated with certain litigation, including the following matters:
     SoundView and certain of its subsidiaries are among the numerous  financial
institutions named as defendants in multiple purported  securities class actions
filed in the United  District  Court for the Southern  District of New York (the
IPO  Allocation  Litigation)  between June and December 2001. The IPO Allocation
Litigation  was  brought on behalf of  persons  who  either  directly  or in the
aftermarket  purchased IPO securities  between March 1997 and December 2000. The
plaintiffs allege that SoundView and the other  underwriters named as defendants
required  customers  receiving  allocations  of IPO shares to pay  excessive and
undisclosed  commissions  on  unrelated  trades  and to  purchase  shares in the
aftermarket  at prices  higher than the IPO price,  in  violation of the federal
securities laws.  SoundView has been named in 31 of the actions - each involving
a different  company's IPO - which

                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION


have been consolidated with 280 other actions in which SoundView is not named as
a defendant.  The  parties,  with the assent of the Court,  have  selected 17 of
these cases as focus cases for the purpose of case-specific  discovery,  and the
Court has certified the existence of a class in the focus cases. Wit Capital,  a
SoundView predecessor,  is a defendant in one of the focus cases.  Additionally,
SoundView and/or related entities had underwriting  commitments in approximately
11 other focus cases;  SoundView  entities are not named as  defendants in these
cases,  but  may  have  indemnification  obligations  to the  lead  underwriters
depending on the outcome of these actions. The Company is vigorously  contesting
such claims on behalf of SoundView pursuant to the above-mentioned indemnity.


Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders

     No matters  were  submitted  to a vote of the  Company's  security  holders
during the fourth quarter of 2004.

Item 7. Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
        of Operations


DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

Overview

     Securities market returns were mixed for much of 2004 due to the cumulative
effects of ongoing  geopolitical,  economic  and  energy  market  uncertainties,
concerns about rising interest rates, and a close presidential  election.  While
this environment weighed on client engagement,  the Company actively pursued its
strategy of  refocusing on its core client base,  improving  product and service
offerings for those clients,  lowering  pricing,  and  streamlining  its overall
infrastructure.  In addition, the Company embarked on a firm-wide cost reduction
effort  designed to mitigate the effects of its price  reductions and to improve
overall efficiency and productivity.
     During the fourth  quarter of 2004,  the  election  was  decided and market
returns turned positive. In this improved  environment,  client asset valuations
recovered and daily average  revenue trades rose by 39% over third quarter lows.
The Dow Jones  Industrial  Average,  the Standard and Poor's 500 Index,  and the
Nasdaq Composite Index ended 2004 up 3%, 9%, and 9%, respectively.  Total client
assets housed at the Company rose by 12% during 2004 to $1.08 trillion;  net new
client  assets  brought  to the  Company  totaled  $50.3 billion  for the  year,
including $16.8 billion in the fourth quarter, the highest in 13 quarters.
     Overall,  the Company's price cuts  contributed to a 14% decline in trading
revenues  for 2004,  yet  continued  success  in  attracting  client  assets and
building  stronger  client  relationships  led to a 17% increase in  non-trading
revenues and total revenue growth of 8%.  Expenses rose by 12% over 2003 levels,
reflecting the  reinstatement  of the Company's  401(k) match and the payment of
higher discretionary bonuses, an increased marketing communications  investment,
and the  recognition  of  $261 million  in  after-tax  charges  relating  to the
Company's exit from the capital markets business and its cost reduction  effort.
As a result, net income declined by 39% from 2003, and the Company's 2004 profit
margin was 6.8%,  compared with 12.1% in the prior year. The Company's 2004 cost
reduction effort enabled the firm to steadily reduce its operating  expense base
throughout  2004,  and  about  $300 million  in  annualized  cost  savings  were
identified and implemented by year end.
     The Company  generates cash primarily through the revenues of its brokerage
and banking  subsidiaries.  These revenues are classified  into  non-trading and
trading categories. The Company earns non-trading revenues primarily through:
o    Asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and
     third-party  mutual  fund  offerings,   as  well  as  fee-based  investment
     management and advisory services; and
o    Interest  revenue  earned on margin loans,  loans to banking  clients,  and
     investments.
     Non-trading revenues are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates,
the Company's  ability to attract new clients,  and client activity levels.  The
Company earns trading revenues through:
o    Commissions earned for executing trades for clients; and
o    Principal  transaction  revenues  for  trading  activity  in  fixed  income
     securities.
     Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes,  the volatility of equity
prices in the securities markets and commission rates.
     Management   of  the  Company   focuses  on  several  key   financial   and
non-financial  metrics  (as  shown in the  following  table) in  evaluating  the
Company's financial position and operating performance:

     the Company's products and services appeal to new and existing clients.

o    Client  assets  is the  market  value of all  client  assets  housed at the
     Company.  Management  considers  client  assets  to be  indicative  of  the
     Company's  appeal  in the  marketplace.  Additionally,  growth  in  certain
     components  of client assets (e.g.,  money market funds)  directly  impacts
     asset management and administration fee revenues.
o    Schwab's daily average  revenue trades (DART) is deemed by management to be
     a key indicator of client  engagement with securities  markets and the most
     prominent driver of commission revenues.
o    Management believes that revenue growth,  pre-tax profit margin, and return
     on stockholders'  equity provide broad indicators of the Company's  overall
     financial health, operating efficiency,  and ability to generate acceptable
     returns.
o    Revenue per average  full-time  equivalent  employee  (revenue  per FTE) is
     considered  by  management  to  be  the  Company's   broadest   measure  of
     productivity.  With the Company's  restructuring  initiatives over the past
     four years, revenue per FTE has steadily improved to $269,000 in 2004.
o    Revenue on client assets is defined as  annualized  basis points of revenue
     per dollar of average client assets.  Management  believes that this metric
     is a key measure of the Company's ability to broaden the number of services
     utilized by clients.

================================================================================

2004 Cost Reduction Effort
     In the second  quarter of 2004,  the Company  commenced  a  firm-wide  cost
reduction  effort  designed  to  mitigate  the  financial  impact of its pricing
changes  (see  Results  of   Operations  -  Financial   Overview  -  Revenues  -
Commissions)  and to strengthen its  productivity  and efficiency.  The goals of
this effort  include  eliminating  work that is not essential to meeting  client
service standards or the Company's ongoing operating needs,  reengineering  work
processes to maximize productivity, minimizing organizational complexity through
functional  streamlining,  and addressing  business unit performance  across the
Company.  During 2004, the Company  reallocated certain client service functions
from its Orlando regional telephone service center to other centers. The Company
also closed or consolidated 111 branch offices,  began opening smaller satellite
offices in  selected  locations,  and took steps to  streamline  its  technology
organization.  Additionally,  the  Company  reduced  its  operating  facilities,
primarily by exiting certain administrative office space in California.
     The Company recorded pre-tax  restructuring charges of $211 million in 2004
related to the 2004 cost reduction effort,  primarily reflecting severance costs
for approximately 1,600 employees and facilities reduction charges.
     The  Company's  2004 cost  reduction  effort  enabled  the firm to steadily
reduce its operating  expense base  throughout  2004, and about  $300 million in
annualized cost savings were identified and implemented by year end. The Company
estimates  that its 2004 cost  reduction  effort  will  result in  approximately
$16 million,  or $10 million  after-tax,  of restructuring  charges in the first
quarter of 2005. Estimated additional charges for, or expense savings from, cost
reduction efforts to be implemented during 2005 have not yet been determined.

2003, 2002, and 2001 Initiatives
     The Company's  2003,  2002,  and 2001  restructuring  initiatives  included
workforce reductions, reductions in operating facilities, the removal of certain
systems hardware,  software, and equipment from service, and the withdrawal from
certain international  operations.  These initiatives reduced operating expenses
and   adjusted   the   Company's   organizational   structure  to  help  improve
productivity,  enhance efficiency, and increase profitability.  During 2004, the
Company  recorded  pre-tax  restructuring  charges of $3 million  related to its
2003,  2002,  and 2001  restructuring  initiatives,  primarily due to changes in
estimates of sublease income  associated with  previously  announced  efforts to
sublease excess facilities.

     For further  information on the Company's  restructuring  initiatives,  see
"Item 8 - Financial  Statements and  Supplementary  Data - Notes to Consolidated
Financial  Statements  - 3.  Restructuring  Charges."  The actual costs of these
restructuring  initiatives  could  differ from the  estimated  costs,  depending
primarily  on  the  Company's  ability  to  sublease  properties.   For  further

Corporate Development

Discontinued Operations:  On October 29, 2004, the Company completed the sale of
its capital markets  business to UBS.  Pursuant to the purchase  agreement,  UBS
acquired all of the partnership interests of Schwab Capital Markets L.P. and all
of  the  outstanding   capital  stock  of  SoundView   Technology   Group,  Inc.
(collectively referred to as Schwab Soundview Capital Markets, or SSCM) for $265
million in cash.  At closing,  the Company and Schwab  entered  into  eight-year
order routing and  execution  services  agreements  with UBS for the handling of
Schwab's equity and listed options order flow. SSCM comprised  substantially all
of the previously-reported Capital Markets segment.
     The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of SSCM have
been  presented as  discontinued  operations on the  consolidated  statements of
income and of cash flows,  respectively,  and the assets and liabilities of SSCM
prior  to the  sale  have  each  been  combined  and  presented  as  assets  and
liabilities of discontinued  operations on the  consolidated  balance sheet. The
Company's consolidated prior period revenues, expenses, taxes on income, assets,
liabilities, and cash flows have been adjusted to reflect this presentation.
     In January 2003, the Company sold its U.K.  brokerage  subsidiary,  Charles
Schwab Europe  (CSE),  to Barclays PLC. The results of operations of CSE, net of
income taxes,  have been summarized as discontinued  operations on the Company's
consolidated  statement  of income.  The  Company's  consolidated  prior  period
revenues,  expenses,  and taxes on income  have been  adjusted  to reflect  this
presentation.
     For further information on the Company's discontinued operations, see "Item
8 -  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data  -  Notes  to  Consolidated
Financial Statements - 5. Discontinued Operations."

Divestiture  of  Investment:  In June 2003,  the Company sold its  investment in
Aitken  Campbell,  a  market-making  joint venture in the U.K., to the Company's
joint venture partner,  TD Waterhouse  Group, Inc. In 2003, the Company recorded
an  impairment  charge to reduce the  carrying  value of its  investment  and an
income  tax  benefit.  The  Company's  share  of  Aitken  Campbell's  historical
earnings,  which was accounted for under the equity method,  was not material to
the  Company's   results  of  operations,   EPS,  or  cash  flows.  For  further
information,  see "Item 8 - Financial  Statements and Supplementary Data   Notes
to   Consolidated   Financial   Statements     6.  Business   Acquisitions   and
Divestitures."

Sale of Corporate  Trust  Business:  In June 2001, USTC sold its Corporate Trust
business  to The  Bank of New York  Company,  Inc.  The  Company  recognized  an
extraordinary  gain  in  2002  related  to  this  sale,  primarily  for  amounts
recognized  upon  satisfaction  of certain client  retention  requirements.  For
further information, see "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -
Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  - 4.  Sale  of  Corporate  Trust
Business."


RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Financial Overview

     Total  revenues  were $4.2 billion in 2004,  up $306  million,  or 8%, from
2003. The Company's  non-trading  revenues totaled $3.2 billion in 2004, up $471
million,  or 17%,  from 2003.  This increase was primarily due to an increase in
asset management and administration  fees resulting primarily from higher levels
of client  assets and an increase in net interest  revenue  resulting  primarily
from higher levels of and changes in the composition of interest-earning assets.
Trading revenues  totaled $1.0 billion in 2004, down $165 million,  or 14%, from
2003.  This  decrease was  primarily  due to lower  average  revenue  earned per
revenue trade  resulting from  reductions in the Company's  commission  pricing,
partially offset by higher client trading activity.
     Total  expenses  excluding  interest  for 2004 were $3.6  billion,  up $378
million,  or 12%, from 2003.  This increase was primarily due to a $212 million,
or 13%,  increase in  compensation  and benefits  expense  resulting from higher
levels of discretionary bonuses to employees,  employee benefits,  and incentive
compensation,  as well as a $138  million,  or 182%,  increase in  restructuring
charges.
     Income from continuing  operations before taxes on income and extraordinary
gain for 2004 was $645 million,  down $72 million,  or 10% from 2003,  primarily
due to the  combination of factors  discussed  above - higher  compensation  and
benefits expense and restructuring charges, partially offset by higher levels of
non-trading  revenues.  Loss  from  discontinued  operations,  net of  tax,  was
$128 million for 2004,  compared to $4 million for 2003. Net income for 2004 was
$286 million,  or $.21 per share, down 39% from 2003,  primarily due to a higher
loss from  discontinued  operations,  net of tax,  as well as lower  income from
continuing  operations  before  taxes on  income  and  extraordinary  gain.  The
Company's  after-tax  profit margin for 2004 was 6.8%, down from 12.1% for 2003.
Return on stockholders' equity was 6% for 2004, down from 11% in 2003.

                 Financial Condition and Results of Operations
           (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)


     Certain  reclassifications  have been made to prior year amounts to conform
to the  current  presentation.  All  references  to  earnings  per  share  (EPS)
information  in  this  Management's   Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Results  of
Operations and Financial  Condition  reflect  diluted  earnings per share unless
otherwise noted.

Segment  Information:   In  evaluating  the  Company's  financial   performance,
management uses adjusted operating income, a non-generally  accepted  accounting
principles  (non-GAAP)  income  measure which excludes  items  described  below.
Management  believes that adjusted operating income is a useful indicator of the
ongoing  financial  performance of the Company's  segments,  and a tool that can
provide  meaningful  insight into financial  performance  without the effects of
certain material items that are not expected to be an ongoing part of operations
(e.g.,  extraordinary  items,  non-operating  revenues,  restructuring  charges,
impairment charges,  acquisition- and merger-related  charges,  and discontinued
operations).
     In 2004, net income of $286 million  included the following  items which in
total had the  effect of  decreasing  after-tax  income  by $252  million:  $133
million of after-tax  restructuring  charges, a $128 million after-tax loss from
discontinued  operations,  and a $9 million after-tax gain on an investment.  In
2003, net income of $472 million included the following items which in total had
the  effect of  decreasing  after-tax  income by $19  million:  $48  million  of
after-tax  restructuring  charges, a $5 million investment write-down related to
the Company's U.K.  market-making  operation,  a $4 million  after-tax loss from
discontinued operations, a $16 million tax benefit associated with the Company's
sale of its U.K. market-making  operation,  an $11 million after-tax gain on the
sale of an  investment,  and an $11  million  tax  benefit  associated  with the
Company's  merger with U.S. Trust. In 2002, net income of $109 million  included
the following items which in total had the effect of decreasing after-tax income
by $304 million: $211 million of after-tax  restructuring charges, a $52 million
after-tax loss from discontinued operations, a $37 million investment write-down
related to the Company's U.K. market-making  operation, $16 million of after-tax
acquisition-related  charges, and a $12 million after-tax  extraordinary gain on
the sale of U.S. Trust's Corporate Trust business.
     As detailed  in "Item 8 - Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data -
Notes to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements - 26.  Segment  Information,"  the
Company's  adjusted  operating income before taxes was $845 million for 2004, up
$64 million,  or 8%, from 2003 due to increases of  $58 million,  or 13%, in the
Individual Investor segment,  and $9 million, or 23%, in the U.S. Trust segment,
partially  offset by a  decrease  of  $21 million,  or 7%, in the  Institutional
Investor segment.  The increase in the Individual Investor segment was primarily
due to higher  revenues  resulting  from increased  client trading  activity and
levels of client assets. The decrease in the Institutional  Investor segment was
primarily due to growth in expenses  outpacing growth in revenues primarily as a
result of higher client acquisition and servicing costs.

Revenues

     The Company  categorizes its revenues as either non-trading or trading.  As
shown in the following table,  non-trading and total revenues  increased,  while
trading revenues decreased from 2003.

     While the Individual Investor and Institutional  Investor segments generate
both  non-trading  and  trading  revenues,   the  U.S. Trust  segment  generates
primarily  non-trading  revenues.  Revenues  by  segment  are  as  shown  in the
following table:

================================================================================
(1)  Primarily consists of pre-tax gains on investments.

     The increase in revenues in the U.S. Trust segment was primarily due to the
acquisition  of State Street  Corporation's  Private Asset  Management  group in
October  2003 and  higher  levels of  client  assets.  See  "Item 8 -  Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements -
26. Segment Information" for financial information by segment for the last three
years.

Asset Management and Administration Fees
     Asset management and administration  fees include mutual fund service fees,
as well as fees for other asset-based  financial services provided to individual
and  institutional  clients.  The Company  earns  mutual fund  service  fees for
transfer agent services,  shareholder services,  administration,  and investment
management  provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder
services  provided  to  third-party  funds.  These fees are based upon the daily
balances of client  assets  invested in  third-party  funds and upon the average
daily net assets of the Company's  proprietary  funds.  Mutual fund service fees
are earned through each of the Company's segments.  The Company also earns asset
management and administration fees for financial services provided to individual
and institutional clients, including investment management and consulting, trust
and fiduciary  services,  custody services,  financial and estate planning,  and
private  banking  services.  These  fees are  primarily  based on the  value and
composition  of assets  under  management  and are  earned  through  each of the
Company's segments.
     The increase in asset management and related service fees from 2003 to 2004
was primarily due to higher levels of client assets and higher  asset-based fees
from certain client relationships. The increase in mutual fund service fees from
2003 to 2004 was  primarily  due to higher  average  assets in and service  fees
earned on  Schwab's  Mutual  Fund  OneSource(R) service. The  increase  in asset
management  and  related  service  fees from 2002 to 2003 was  primarily  due to
higher asset-based fees from certain client relationships, partially offset by a
decrease in account fees.  The increase in mutual fund service fees from 2002 to
2003 was due to higher  service  fees earned on and  average  assets in Schwab's
Mutual Fund OneSource service, and higher service fees earned on SchwabFunds(R).

Commissions
     The Company earns commission  revenues by executing client trades primarily
through the  Individual  Investor and  Institutional  Investor  segments.  These
revenues are affected by the number of client  accounts that trade,  the average
number of revenue-generating  trades per account, and the average revenue earned
per revenue trade.
     The decrease in commission  revenues from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to
lower  average  revenue  earned  per  revenue  trade as a result of  significant
reductions in commission pricing for a wide range of clients in 2004,  partially
offset by higher  daily  average  revenue  trades.  The  increase in  commission
revenues from 2002 to 2003 was  primarily  due to higher daily  average  trades,
partially offset by lower revenue per revenue trade.
     Effective in June 2004,  the Company  lowered its online equity  pricing to
$9.95 for clients with more than $1 million in assets at Schwab and also lowered
commission pricing for a wide range of other clients. Additionally, effective in
November 2004, the Company lowered its base online equity commission  pricing to
$19.95,  expanded  access  to  $9.95  online  equity  commissions,  and  lowered
commissions on online and broker-assisted trades of options contracts. Primarily
as a result of these pricing changes,  the Company's  average revenue earned per
revenue trade declined from $30.97 in May 2004 to $18.82 in December 2004.

           (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)


     As  illustrated  in the  following  table,  daily  average  revenue  trades
executed  by the  Company  increased  11% in 2004.  Average  revenue  earned per
revenue  trade  decreased  23% from 2003 to 2004,  primarily  due to the pricing
changes  discussed above.  Average revenue earned per revenue trade decreased 7%
from 2002 to 2003,  primarily due to decreased  pricing of certain equity trades
made  through  online  channels  as well as  decreased  pricing of fixed  income
securities trades.

     The Company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and
periodically  adjusts prices to enhance its  competitive  position.  The Company
continues to actively  evaluate  commission rates and fee structures for certain
clients.

Net Interest Revenue
     Net interest  revenue is the difference  between interest earned on certain
assets  (mainly margin loans to clients,  investments of segregated  client cash
balances,  loans to banking  clients,  and  securities  available  for sale) and
interest paid on supporting  liabilities  (mainly  deposits from banking clients
and brokerage client cash balances). Net interest revenue is affected by changes
in  the  volume  and  mix  of  these  assets  and  liabilities,  as  well  as by
fluctuations in interest rates and hedging strategies.
     The Company's net interest  revenue is earned through each of its segments.
In clearing its clients' trades,  Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients.
In most  cases,  Schwab  pays its clients  interest  on cash  balances  awaiting
investment,  and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue.  Margin loans
arise  when  Schwab  lends  funds to  clients  on a  secured  basis to  purchase
securities.  Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used
for margin lending are generally  segregated into  investment  accounts that are
maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients.
     When investing  segregated client cash balances,  Schwab must adhere to SEC
regulations   that  restrict   investments   to  U.S.   government   securities,
participation   certificates,   mortgage-backed  securities  guaranteed  by  the
Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S.
banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities.
Schwab's policies for credit quality and maximum maturity  requirements are more
restrictive than these SEC regulations.  In each of the last three years, resale
agreements  accounted for over 65% of Schwab's  investments of segregated client
cash  balances.   The  average  maturities  of  Schwab's  total  investments  of
segregated  client cash balances were 142 days for 2004,  161 days for 2003, and

                 Financial Condition and Results of Operations
           (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)


     The   Company's   interest-earning   assets  are   financed   primarily  by
interest-bearing  brokerage  client cash  balances  and  deposits  from  banking
clients. Other funding sources include noninterest-bearing brokerage client cash
balances,  proceeds from  stock-lending  activities,  short-term  borrowings and
long-term debt, as well as stockholders'  equity.  Client-related  daily average
balances,  interest  rates,  and average net interest  spread are  summarized as
follows:

     The increase in net interest revenue from 2003 to 2004 was primarily due to
higher  levels of and changes in the  composition  of  interest-earning  assets,
including  increases  in margin  loan  balances,  loans to banking  clients  and
securities  available for sale,  partially  offset by higher  interest  rates on
brokerage client cash balances due to changes in the interest rate  environment.
The decrease in net  interest  revenue  from 2002 to 2003 was  primarily  due to
changes in the composition of interest-earning  assets, including the decline in
margin  loan  balances  and  the   corresponding   increase  in   client-related
investments.  Additionally, the decline in yields on interest-earning assets due
to changes in the interest rate environment from 2002 to 2003 was only partially
offset by lower yields on funding sources.
     Since the  Company  establishes  the rates paid on  brokerage  client  cash
balances and certain banking  deposits and the rates charged on margin loans, it
manages a substantial portion of its net interest spread. However, the spread is
influenced  by  external  factors  such as the  interest  rate  environment  and
competition.  The Company's  average net interest spread  increased from 2003 to
2004 as the average yield on interest-earning  assets,  primarily client-related
investments,  increased more than the average  interest rate on funding sources.
The Company's  average net interest  spread  decreased  from 2002 to 2003 as the
average yield on interest-earning assets, primarily client-related  investments,
declined more than the average interest rate on funding sources.

Principal Transactions
     Principal  transaction  revenues are  primarily  comprised of revenues from
client  fixed  income  securities  trading  activity,  which are included in the
Individual Investor and Institutional Investor segments.  Factors that influence
principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades, market price
volatility, and changes in regulations and industry practices.

Other Revenues
     Other revenues  include net gains and losses on certain  investments,  fees
for services  (such as transfer of assets),  account  service fees, and software
maintenance  fees.  Other  revenues  are earned  through  each of the  Company's
segments.

Expenses Excluding Interest

     As shown in the table below, total expenses excluding interest increased in
2004 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense and restructuring
charges.   Additionally,   increases  in  professional   services   expense  and
advertising  and  market  development  expense  were  substantially   offset  by
decreases in depreciation and  amortization  expense and occupancy and equipment
expense.

Compensation and Benefits
     Compensation and benefits expense  includes  salaries and wages,  incentive
and variable  compensation,  related employee  benefits and taxes, and retention
program costs arising from certain  acquisitions and mergers.  Employees receive
variable  compensation that is tied to the achievement of specified  objectives,
primarily related to revenue growth and profit margin.  Therefore, a significant
portion of compensation and benefits expense will fluctuate with these measures.
     The increase in  compensation  and  benefits  expense from 2003 to 2004 was
primarily due to higher levels of discretionary  bonuses to employees,  employee
benefits, and incentive compensation.  The decrease in compensation and benefits
expense  from  2002  to 2003  was  primarily  due to a  reduction  in  full-time
equivalent  employees through the Company's expense reduction measures and lower
levels of employee  benefits,  partially  offset by higher  levels of  incentive
compensation and discretionary bonuses to employees. The following table shows a
comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data:

     on a contract basis.  All amounts have been adjusted to reflect the sale of
     the Company's capital markets business.

     Employee  benefits and other expense  increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily
due to the  reinstatement of the Company's 401(k) employee  contribution  match,
which  was  suspended  in 2003  (except  for a  discretionary  award to  certain
non-officer employees made in the fourth quarter of 2003). Employee benefits and
other expense decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to the suspension of the
Company's 401(k) employer contribution in 2003 as discussed above. Additionally,
employee  benefits and other expense  includes net pension expense of $7 million
in 2004 and $8 million in 2003 related to  U.S. Trust's  defined benefit pension
plan,  compared  to net pension  income of less than  $1 million  for 2002.  The
increase  in  pension  expense in 2003 was  primarily  due to changes in certain
assumptions used to calculate  pension  expense,  including the expected rate of
return on pension plan assets and the discount rate, both effective in 2003.
     See  "Item 8 -  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data - Notes  to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements - 2. Significant  Accounting  Policies - New
Accounting Standards" for a discussion of future compensation expense related to
stock option awards.

Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits
     The  decreases in occupancy  and  equipment  expense from 2002 to 2004 were
primarily  due to the  Company's  restructuring  initiatives  and other  expense
reduction measures (see Description of Business - Restructuring).
     The  increases  in  professional  services  expense  from 2002 to 2004 were
primarily due to higher levels of consulting  fees in several  areas,  including
new and expanded products and services, and information technology projects.
     The decreases in depreciation  and  amortization  expense from 2002 to 2004
were  primarily  due to increases in  fully-

amortized assets and the Company's  restructuring  initiatives and other expense
reduction measures.
     The increase in  advertising  and market  development  expense from 2003 to
2004  was  primarily  due to the  Company's  increased  print  and  other  media
spending.  The decrease in advertising and market development  expense from 2002
to 2003  was  primarily  due to  reductions,  as part of the  Company's  expense
reduction measures, in brand-focused television and other media spending.

Taxes on Income
     The  Company's   effective  income  tax  rate  on  income  from  continuing
operations  was 35.8% in 2004,  33.6% in 2003 and 40.2% in 2002. The increase in
the  effective  income  tax  rate  from  2003 to 2004 was  primarily  due to tax
benefits in 2003 related to the  deductibility  of certain costs associated with
the  Company's  merger  with  U.S.  Trust  and the  Company's  sale of its  U.K.
market-making operation. The decrease in the effective income tax rate from 2002
to 2003 was primarily due to the tax benefits in 2003 discussed  above,  as well
as an  impairment  charge in 2002 related to the  Company's  U.K.  market-making
operation  which was not  deductible  for tax purposes.  Management  expects the
Company's effective income tax rate in 2005 to be approximately 38%.


LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

     CSC is a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company
subject to  supervision  and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System  (Federal  Reserve  Board) under the Bank Holding  Company Act of
1956, as amended.  CSC conducts  virtually all business through its wholly owned
subsidiaries.  The capital  structure among CSC and its subsidiaries is designed
to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational  needs
and   regulatory   requirements.   See  "Item  8  -  Financial   Statements  and
Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - 22. Regulatory
Requirements."

Liquidity

CSC
     CSC's  liquidity  needs are  generally  met through  cash  generated by its
subsidiaries,  as well as cash  provided by  external  financing.  As  discussed
below,  Schwab and CSC's  depository  institution  subsidiaries  are  subject to
regulatory  requirements  that may restrict them from certain  transactions with
CSC.  Management  believes  that  funds  generated  by the  operations  of CSC's
subsidiaries  will  continue to be the primary  funding  source in meeting CSC's
liquidity  needs,   providing   adequate  liquidity  to  meet  CSC's  depository
institution  subsidiaries'  capital  guidelines,  and  maintaining  Schwab's net
capital.  Based on their  respective  regulatory  capital ratios at December 31,
2004 and 2003,  the  Company and its  depository  institution  subsidiaries  are
considered well capitalized.
     CSC has  liquidity  needs that arise  from its  Senior  Medium-Term  Notes,
Series A  (Medium-Term  Notes),  as well as from the funding of cash  dividends,
acquisitions,   and  other   investments.   The  Medium-Term   Notes,  of  which
$386 million  was issued and outstanding at  December 31,  2004, have maturities
ranging from 2005 to 2010 and fixed  interest  rates ranging from 6.21% to 8.05%
with  interest  payable  semiannually.  CSC has entered into  interest rate swap
agreements (Swaps) that effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of
a portion  of the  Medium-Term  Notes  from  fixed to  variable.  For a complete
discussion of the Swaps,  see "Item 8 - Financial  Statements and  Supplementary
Data - Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements - 24. Financial  Instruments
Subject to Off-Balance  Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market Risk." The Medium-Term
Notes are rated A2 by Moody's  Investors  Service  (Moody's),  A- by  Standard &
Poor's Ratings Group (S&P), and A by Fitch IBCA, Inc. (Fitch).
     CSC has a prospectus  supplement on file with the SEC enabling CSC to issue
up to $750 million in Senior or Senior Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series A.
At December 31, 2004, all of these notes remained unissued.
     In  the  second  quarter  of  2004,  the  SEC  declared   effective   CSC's
Registration  Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form S-3 relating to
a universal shelf registration for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion  aggregate
amount of various  securities,  including common stock,  preferred  stock,  debt
securities, and warrants. The Company currently intends to use any proceeds from
the issuance of these securities for general corporate purposes,  including, but
not limited to, working capital and possible acquisitions. At December 31, 2004,
all of these securities remained unissued.
     CSC has  authorization  from  its  Board  of  Directors  (Board)  to  issue
commercial paper up to the amount of CSC's committed,  unsecured credit facility
(see below),  not to exceed  $1.5 billion.  At December 31,  2004, no commercial
paper has been issued. CSC's ratings for these short-term  borrowings are P-1 by
Moody's, A-2 by S&P, and F1 by Fitch.
     CSC maintains an $800 million  committed,  unsecured credit facility with a
group of nineteen banks which is scheduled to expire in June 2005. This facility
replaced a facility that expired in June 2004.  These  facilities were unused in
2004. Any issuances under CSC's commercial paper program (see above) will reduce
the amount  available  under this  facility.  The funds under this  facility are
available

           (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)


for  general  corporate  purposes  and CSC pays a  commitment  fee on the unused
balance of this facility.  The financial  covenants in this facility require CSC
to maintain a minimum level of stockholders'  equity, Schwab to maintain minimum
net capital ratios, as defined, and CSC's depository institution subsidiaries to
be well capitalized,  as defined.  Management  believes that these  restrictions
will not have a material effect on its ability to meet  foreseeable  dividend or
funding requirements.
     CSC also has direct access to $781 million of the $831 million uncommitted,
unsecured  bank  credit  lines,  provided  by eight  banks,  that are  primarily
utilized by Schwab to manage short-term  liquidity.  The amount available to CSC
under  these  lines is lower than the amount  available  to Schwab  because  the
credit line  provided by one of these banks is only  available to Schwab.  These
lines were not used by CSC in 2004.

Schwab
     Most of  Schwab's  assets  are  readily  convertible  to  cash,  consisting
primarily  of   short-term   (i.e.,   less  than  150  days)   investment-grade,
interest-earning  investments  (the  majority  of which are  segregated  for the
exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory  requirements),  receivables
from  brokerage  clients,  and  receivables  from brokers,  dealers and clearing
organizations.  Client  margin  loans are  demand  loan  obligations  secured by
readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers
and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions,  which
usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days.
     Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing  activities
are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were
$27.0 billion,  $25.6 billion, and $24.9 billion at December 31, 2004, 2003, and
2002, respectively.  Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and
operating  earnings  will  continue to be the primary  sources of liquidity  for
Schwab in the future.
     Upon  adoption  of  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  Interpretation
(FIN) No. 46 - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 - Consolidated  Financial  Statements in the
first quarter of 2003, the Company  consolidated a special purpose trust (Trust)
and  recorded a note payable of  $235 million.  This Trust was formed in 2000 to
finance the  acquisition  and  renovation  of an office  building  and land.  In
June 2004,  the Company  exercised its option to purchase this property from the
Trust and repaid  $99 million of the note payable.  Simultaneously,  the Company
completed a transaction on this property with American Financial Realty Trust, a
publicly-traded   real  estate  investment  trust,   resulting  in  proceeds  of
$136 million,  which was used to repay the remainder of the note payable,  and a
20-year lease. This transaction was accounted for as a financing.  The remaining
lease  financing  liability of $134 million is being reduced by a portion of the
lease payments over the 20-year term.
     To manage short-term  liquidity,  Schwab maintains  uncommitted,  unsecured
bank  credit  lines  with a  group  of  eight  banks  totaling  $831 million  at
December 31,  2004 (as noted  previously,  $781 million  of these lines are also
available for CSC to use). The need for short-term  borrowings  arises primarily
from  timing  differences  between  cash  flow  requirements  and the  scheduled
liquidation of interest-bearing investments.  Schwab used such borrowings for 15
days in 2004, with the daily amounts borrowed averaging $46 million.  There were
no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2004.
     To satisfy the margin  requirement of client option  transactions  with the
Options  Clearing  Corporation  (OCC),  Schwab  has  unsecured  letter of credit
agreements  with  nine  banks in favor of the OCC  aggregating  $630 million  at
December 31,  2004.  Schwab  pays  a fee  to  maintain  these  arrangements.  In
connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide
collateral  to  certain  brokerage  clients.  Schwab  satisfies  the  collateral
requirements by arranging  letters of credit (LOCs), in favor of these brokerage
clients,  that are  guaranteed by multiple  banks.  At  December 31,  2004,  the
outstanding value of these LOCs totaled  $52 million.  No funds were drawn under
these LOCs at December 31, 2004.
     Schwab is subject to  regulatory  requirements  that are intended to ensure
the  general  financial   soundness  and  liquidity  of  broker-dealers.   These
regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to CSC, paying
cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees
if such payment  would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate  debit
balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar  requirement of $1 million.  At
December 31, 2004, Schwab's net capital was $1.2 billion (12% of aggregate debit
balances),  which was $1.0 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital
and  $723 million  in excess  of 5% of  aggregate  debit  balances.  Schwab  has
historically  targeted  net  capital to be at least 10% of its  aggregate  debit
balances, which primarily consist of client margin loans.
     To manage Schwab's regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with
a  $1.4 billion  subordinated  revolving  credit  facility which is scheduled to
expire  in  September 2005.  The  amount  outstanding  under  this  facility  at
December 31,  2004 was $220 million.  Borrowings under this subordinated lending
arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab.

U.S. Trust
     U.S.  Trust's  liquidity  needs are  generally  met through  deposits  from
banking clients, equity capital, and borrowings.
     Certain  Schwab  brokerage  clients can sweep the excess cash held in their
accounts  into a money market  deposit  account at U.S.  Trust.  At December 31,
2004, these balances totaled $577 million.
     In addition to traditional funding sources such as deposits,  federal funds
purchased, and repurchase agreements, USTC's depository institution subsidiaries
have established their own external funding sources.  At December 31, 2004, U.S.
Trust had $52 million in Trust Preferred Capital  Securities  outstanding with a
fixed  interest  rate  of  8.41%.  Certain  of  USTC's  depository   institution
subsidiaries have established  credit facilities with the Federal Home Loan Bank
System  (FHLB)  totaling $1.7  billion.  At December 31, 2004,  $625 million was
outstanding  under these  facilities.  Additionally,  at December 31, 2004, U.S.
Trust had $38 million of federal funds purchased.
     U.S. Trust also engages in intercompany  repurchase  agreements with Schwab
Bank and Schwab.  At  December 31,  2004,  U.S. Trust  had $400 million and $200
million in  repurchase  agreements  outstanding  with  Schwab  Bank and  Schwab,
respectively.
     CSC provides U.S.  Trust with a  $300 million  short-term  credit  facility
maturing  in December  2006.  Borrowings  under this  facility do not qualify as
regulatory  capital for U.S. Trust.  The amount  outstanding under this facility
was $30 million at December 31, 2004.
     U.S. Trust uses Swaps with CSC and third parties to hedge the interest rate
risk  associated  with its variable rate deposits  from banking  clients.  These
Swaps are  structured  for U.S. Trust to receive a variable rate of interest and
pay a fixed rate of interest.  At December  31, 2004,  the Swaps with CSC have a
notional value of  $650 million  and a fair value of $9 million.  For a complete
discussion of the Swaps with third parties,  see "Item 8 - Financial  Statements
and  Supplementary  Data - Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  - 24.
Financial  Instruments  Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market
Risk."
     U.S. Trust  is  subject  to the  Federal  Reserve  Board's  risk-based  and
leverage capital  guidelines.  These regulations  require banks and bank holding
companies to maintain minimum levels of capital. In addition,  USTC's depository
institution  subsidiaries  are subject to limitations on the amount of dividends
they can pay to USTC.

Schwab Bank
     Schwab Bank's current  liquidity  needs are generally met through  deposits
from banking clients and equity capital.
     Certain  Schwab  brokerage  clients can sweep the excess cash held in their
accounts into a money market  deposit  account at Schwab Bank.  At  December 31,
2004, these balances totaled $4.0 billion.
     Schwab Bank has access to  traditional  funding  sources  such as deposits,
federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements.  Additionally,  CSC provides
Schwab Bank with a $100 million  short-term credit facility maturing in December
2005.  Borrowings  under this facility do not qualify as regulatory  capital for
Schwab Bank. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2004.
     In May 2004,  Schwab Bank  established a credit  facility with the FHLB. At
December 31,  2004,  $266 million  was available,  and no funds were drawn under
this facility.
     Schwab  Bank  is  subject  to the  same  risk-based  and  leverage  capital
guidelines  as U.S. Trust  (see  discussion  above),  except that Schwab Bank is
subject to a minimum  tier 1 leverage  ratio of 8% for its first  three years of
operations.  In addition, Schwab Bank is subject to limitations on the amount of
dividends it can pay to CSC.

Liquidity Risk Factors
     The  Company  manages  risk  by  maintaining  sufficient  liquid  financial
resources  to fund its balance  sheet and meet its  obligations.  The  Company's
liquidity needs are met primarily through cash generated by operations,  as well
as cash provided by external  financing.  Risks in meeting these needs may arise
with  fluctuations  in client  cash or deposit  balances,  as well as changes in
market conditions.
     Specific  risk factors which may affect the  Company's  liquidity  position
include:
o    a dramatic increase in the Company's client lending  activities  (including
     margin,  mortgage,  and personal  lending)  which may reduce the  Company's
     liquid resources and capital position;
o    a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage  client accounts which may
     affect the amount of the Company's liquid assets; and
o    a  significant  downgrade  in the  Company's  credit  ratings  which  could
     increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets.

Cash and Capital Resources
     The Company's cash position  (reported as cash and cash  equivalents on the
Company's  consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in
brokerage  client  cash  balances  and the  associated  amounts  required  to be
segregated  under federal or other  regulatory  guidelines.  Timing  differences
between cash and investments  actually segregated on a given date and the amount
required  to be  segregated  for that date may arise in the  ordinary  course of
business  and  are  addressed  by the  Company  in  accordance  with  applicable
regulations.  Other factors  which affect the  Company's  cash position and cash
flows  include  investment

                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
                     Management's Discussion and Analysis of
                 Financial Condition and Results of Operations
           (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)


activity  in  securities  owned,  levels of  capital  expenditures,  acquisition
activity,  banking  client  deposit  and loan  activity,  financing  activity in
short-term borrowings and long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases
of CSC's common stock.
     In 2004,  cash and cash  equivalents  decreased  $7 million to $2.8 billion
primarily due to higher levels of securities available for sale and increases in
loans to banking  clients,  substantially  offset by increases in deposits  from
banking  clients,  including sweep deposit  accounts.  Certain Schwab  brokerage
clients can sweep the excess cash held in their  brokerage  accounts  into these
money market  deposit  accounts at Schwab Bank or  U.S. Trust.  At  December 31,
2004, these sweep deposit balances totaled  $4.6 billion,  up $3.0 billion  from
December 31,  2003. This sweep deposit activity is reflected on the Consolidated
Statement  of Cash Flows as a cash outflow  from  payables to brokerage  clients
(classified as an operating activity) and a cash inflow to deposits from banking
clients (classified as a financing activity).
     The  Company's   capital   expenditures   were  $194 million  in  2004  and
$147 million  in 2003, or 5% and 4% of revenues in 2004 and 2003,  respectively.
In 2004, 86% of capital expenditures were for information technology and 14% for
facilities expansion and improvements.  Capital expenditures include capitalized
costs  for  developing   internal-use   software  of  $79 million  in  2004  and
$64 million in 2003.
     Management  currently  anticipates that 2005 capital  expenditures  will be
approximately  15%  lower  than  2004  spending.  As has been the case in recent
years, the Company may adjust its capital  expenditures from period to period as
business  conditions  change.  Management  believes that funds  generated by its
operations  will  continue  to be the  primary  funding  source  of its  capital
expenditures.
     Certain  cash  flows  from  financing  activities  by the  Company  in 2004
include:
o    Net repayment of $179 million of long-term debt;
o    Receipt of cash  proceeds of  $51 million  on the exercise of 11 million of
     the Company's  stock  options,  with a  weighted-average  exercise price of
     $4.88, and a related tax benefit of $18 million; and
o    Payment of common stock dividends of $101 million.
     The Company  monitors both the relative  composition  and absolute level of
its capital  structure.  The Company's total financial  capital  (long-term debt
plus  stockholders'  equity)  at  December 31,   2004  was  $5.0 billion,   down
$262 million,  or 5%,  from a year  ago,  due  to  lower  stockholders'  equity,
primarily resulting from stock repurchases and a net decrease in long-term debt.
At December 31,  2004, the Company had long-term debt of $585 million, or 12% of
total financial capital,  bearing interest at a weighted-average  rate of 7.08%.
At December 31,  2004, the Company's  stockholders' equity was $4.4 billion,  or
88% of total financial capital.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements
     The  Company  enters into  various  off-balance-sheet  arrangements  in the
ordinary  course of business,  primarily to meet the needs of its clients and to
reduce its own exposure to interest rate risk. These  arrangements  include firm
commitments  to extend credit and letters of credit.  Additionally,  the Company
enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in
the ordinary  course of business.  For  additional  information on each of these
arrangements,  see "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Notes
to  Consolidated   Financial   Statements  -  23.   Commitments  and  Contingent
Liabilities."

Commitments
     A summary of the  Company's  principal  contractual  obligations  and other

from this table are liabilities  recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that
are  generally  short-term  in  nature  (e.g.,  drafts  payable  and  short-term
borrowings) or without  contractual  payment terms (e.g.,  deposits from banking
clients,  payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation).  Management
believes  that funds  generated by its  operations,  as well as cash provided by
external  financing,  will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting
these obligations and commitments.

Share Repurchases
     CSC  repurchased  39 million shares of its common stock for $383 million in
2004 and 4  million  shares of its  common  stock for $32  million  in 2003.  On
December 9, 2004,  the Board  authorized  the  repurchase of up to an additional
$300 million of CSC's common stock.  As of December 31, 2004,  CSC has authority
to repurchase up to $234 million of its common stock.

Dividend Policy
     Since the initial  dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 63 consecutive  quarterly
dividends and has  increased the dividend 14 times,  including a 43% increase in
the second  quarter of 2004.  Since  1989,  dividends  have  increased  by a 27%
compounded annual growth rate. CSC paid common stock dividends of $.074,  $.050,
and $.044 per share in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. While the payment and
amount of  dividends  are at the  discretion  of the  Board,  subject to certain
regulatory  and other  restrictions,  the  Company  currently  targets  its cash
dividend at approximately 10% to 20% of net income.


RISK MANAGEMENT

Overview

     The  Company's  business  activities  expose  it  to  a  variety  of  risks
including, but not limited to, those discussed below. Identification, assessment
and  management  of these  risks are  essential  to the  success  and  financial
soundness of the Company.
     Senior  management  takes an active role in the Company's  risk  management
process and has developed  policies and procedures under which specific business
and control units are responsible for  identifying,  measuring,  and controlling
various  risks.  Oversight of risk  management  has been delegated to the Global
Risk Steering Committee,  which is comprised of managers who lead major business
and control  functions.  The Global Risk Steering  Committee is responsible  for
reviewing and monitoring the Company's risk exposures,  leading in the continued
development  of the  Company's  risk  management  policies  and  practices,  and
reviewing changes in regulation and other risk-related developments.  The Global
Risk  Steering  Committee  regularly  reports  on risk  management  to the Audit
Committee of the Board of Directors,  which reviews major risk exposures and the
steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.
     The Company  also has a number of  functional  risk  sub-committees,  which
report  into the Global  Risk  Steering  Committee  on a frequent  basis.  These
sub-committees include:
o    Technology and Operations Risk Committee, which focuses on the integrity of
     operational controls and operating capacity of the Company's technology and
     operations systems;
o    Financial Risk Oversight  Committee,  which focuses on the credit exposures
     resulting from client activity (e.g.,  margin lending  activities and loans
     to banking clients),  the investing  activities of certain of the Company's
     proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g.,

                     Management's Discussion and Analysis of
                 Financial Condition and Results of Operations
           (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)


     counterparty and corporate investing activities),  the Company's liquidity,
     capital  resources,  interest rate risk, and the market risk resulting from
     securities positioning activities;
o    Fiduciary Risk Committee, which focuses on overseeing the activities of the
     Company that are deemed to have a fiduciary component; and
o    Disclosure  Committee,  which focuses on the  oversight of  disclosure  and
     internal controls.
     Additionally, the Company's compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and
risk and credit  management  departments  assist management and the various risk
committees in evaluating, testing and monitoring the Company's risk management.
     Risk is  inherent  in the  Company's  business.  Consequently,  despite the
Company's efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving
risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to mitigate risk, there can
be no  assurance  that the  Company  will not  suffer  unexpected  losses due to
operating or other risks.
     The following discussion  highlights the Company's principal risks and some
of  the  policies  and  procedures  for  risk  identification,  assessment,  and
mitigation.  See Liquidity  and Capital  Resources for a discussion on liquidity
risk  and  "Item 8 -  Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data - Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  -  24.  Financial  Instruments  Subject  to
Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market Risk" for additional discussion on
credit risk and market risk.

Technology and Operating Risk
     Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies
in control processes or technology  systems that constrain the Company's ability
to gather, process and communicate information efficiently and securely, without
interruptions. The Company's operations are highly dependent on the integrity of
its  technology  systems and the  Company's  success  depends,  in part,  on its
ability  to  make  timely  enhancements  and  additions  to  its  technology  in
anticipation  of evolving  client needs.  To the extent the Company  experiences
system  interruptions,  errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of
causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes
to its systems,  linkages with third-party  systems,  and power  failures),  the
Company's  business and operations could be significantly  negatively  impacted.
Additionally,  rapid increases in client demand may strain the Company's ability
to enhance  its  technology  and  expand its  operating  capacity.  To  minimize
business  interruptions,  Schwab  has two data  centers  intended,  in part,  to
further  improve  the  recovery  of  business  processing  in  the  event  of an
emergency.  The  Company  is  committed  to an  ongoing  process  of  upgrading,
enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting
client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying  standardized
technology platforms.
     Technology  and  operating  risk  also  includes  the risk of human  error,
employee  misconduct,  external fraud,  computer viruses,  terrorist attack, and
natural disaster.  Employee misconduct could include fraud and  misappropriation
of client or Company assets,  improper use or disclosure of confidential  client
or  Company  information,  and  unauthorized  activities,  such as  transactions
exceeding  acceptable  risks  or  authorized  limits.  External  fraud  includes
misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through
unauthorized  access  to  Company  systems  and data and  client  accounts.  The
frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase.
     The Company has  specific  policies and  procedures  to identify and manage
operational  risk,  and uses periodic risk  self-assessments  and internal audit
reviews to evaluate the  effectiveness of these internal  controls.  The Company
maintains  backup and recovery  functions,  including  facilities for backup and
communications,  and conducts  periodic testing of disaster  recovery plans. The
Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against
fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data.
     Despite the Company's risk mitigation efforts, it is not always possible to
deter  or  prevent  technological  or  operational  failure,  or  fraud or other
misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all
cases. The Company may be subject to litigation,  losses, and regulatory actions
in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to
remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.
     The Company also faces  technology  and operating  risk when it employs the
services of various  external  vendors,  including  domestic  and  international
outsourcing of certain technology, processing and support functions. The Company
manages its exposure to such outsourcing  risks through  contractual  agreements
and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance.
     The Company is actively  engaged in the  research  and  development  of new
technologies,  services,  and  products.  The Company  endeavors  to protect its
research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights,
patents,  trade secrets,  and  contracts.  From time to time, the Company may be
subject to litigation  claims from third parties alleging  infringement of their
intellectual  property rights (e.g.,  patents).  Such litigation can require the
expenditure of significant Company resources.  If the Company were found to have
infringed a third-party patent, or other intellectual  property rights, it could
incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from

using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.

Credit Risk
     Credit  risk is the  potential  for loss due to a  client  or  counterparty
failing to perform its contractual obligations,  or the value of collateral held
to secure obligations proving to be inadequate. The Company's direct exposure to
credit risk mainly results from margin lending  activities,  securities  lending
activities,  its role as a counterparty  in financial  contracts,  and investing
activities,  and  indirectly  from the  investing  activities  of certain of the
Company's  proprietary  funds. To mitigate the risks of such losses, the Company
has  established  policies  and  procedures  which  include:   establishing  and
reviewing   credit   limits,   monitoring   of  credit  limits  and  quality  of
counterparties,  and adjusting margin  requirements for certain  securities.  In
addition,  most of the  Company's  credit  extensions,  such as margin  loans to
clients,  securities lending agreements, and resale agreements, are supported by
collateral  arrangements.  These  arrangements  are subject to  requirements  to
provide additional  collateral in the event that market  fluctuations  result in
declines in the value of collateral received.
     Additionally,  the Company has exposure to credit risk  associated with the
Company's  banking loan  portfolios  held at  U.S. Trust  and Schwab Bank.  This
client credit  exposure is actively  managed  through  individual  and portfolio
reviews  performed  by account  officers  and senior line  management.  Periodic
assessment  of the  validity of credit  ratings,  credit  quality and the credit
management  process is conducted by a credit review department which is separate
from  the loan  origination  and  monitoring  department.  Management  regularly
reviews asset quality including  concentrations,  delinquencies,  non-performing
loans  to  banking  clients,  losses  and  recoveries.  All are  factors  in the
determination of an appropriate  allowance for credit losses,  which is reviewed
quarterly  by  senior  management.  See  "Item  8  -  Financial  Statements  and
Supplementary  Data - Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements - 9. Loans to
Banking  Clients  and  Related  Allowance  for Credit  Losses and 24.  Financial
Instruments  Subject to Off-Balance  Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market Risk" for
an analysis of the Company's  loan  portfolios  and allowance for credit losses,
and for an additional discussion on credit risk, respectively.
     Schwab performs  clearing  services for all securities  transactions in its
client  accounts.  Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its  obligation  to
settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds and other financial
institutions  even if  Schwab's  client  or a  counterparty  fails  to meet  its
obligations to Schwab. See "Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data
- - Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - 24. Financial Instruments Subject
to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market Risk."
     There were no troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2004 or 2003. As
of  December 31,  2004,  management  is not aware of any  significant  potential
problem loans other than the amounts disclosed in "Item 8 - Financial Statements
and Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements - 9. Loans
to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Credit Losses."

Fiduciary Risk
     Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational  loss through
the breaching of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but
are not limited to, individual and institutional trust,  investment  management,
custody,  and cash and securities  processing.  The Company attempts to mitigate
this risk by establishing  procedures to ensure that  obligations to clients are
discharged  faithfully and in compliance  with  applicable  legal and regulatory
requirements.  Business units have the primary  responsibility  for adherence to
the procedures  applicable to their business.  Guidance and control are provided
through the creation,  approval,  and ongoing  review of applicable  policies by
business units and various fiduciary risk committees.

Market Risk
     See  discussion of market risk at "Item 7A - Quantitative  and  Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk."

Legal and Regulatory Risk
     The Company faces  significant  legal and compliance  risk in its business,
and the  volume of  litigation  and  regulatory  proceedings  against  financial
services  firms and the amount of damages  claimed have been  increasing.  Among
other  things,  these risks  relate to the  suitability  of client  investments,
disclosure  obligations and performance  expectations  for Company  products and
services,  supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company's controls.
Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors,  such as if
clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions,
as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients,  and as the
Company  enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition,  the Company and
its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign
regulatory authorities, and self-regulatory  organizations,  and such regulation
is becoming increasingly extensive and complex.
     The Company attempts to mitigate legal and compliance risk through policies
and procedures  reasonably  designed to avoid  litigation  claims and prevent or
detect  violations  of  applicable  legal  and  regulatory  requirements.  These
procedures address issues such as business conduct and

ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications,  extension of
credit, client funds and securities,  books and records,  anti-money laundering,
client  privacy,  employment  policies,  and contracts  management.  Despite the
Company's  efforts to  maintain an  effective  compliance  program and  internal
controls,  legal  breaches and rule  violations,  even if  unintentional,  could
result in reputational  harm,  significant  losses and  disciplinary  sanctions,
including limitations on the Company's business activities.

Potential Strategic Transactions
     The Company from time to time engages in the evaluation,  consideration and
negotiation  of a wide  array of  potential  strategic  transactions,  including
business combinations, acquisitions and dispositions. Any such transaction could
have  a  material  impact  on  the  Company's  financial  position,  results  of
operations, EPS, or cash flows.
     The process of integrating any acquisition may create unforeseen challenges
for the Company's operational,  financial and management information systems, as
well  as  unforeseen  expenditures  and  other  risks,  including  diversion  of
management's  attention from other business concerns,  the potential loss of key
clients,   employees  and  business  partners,   and  difficulties  in  managing
facilities  and  employees  in  different  geographic  areas.  In  addition,  an
acquisition  may cause the Company to assume  liabilities  or become  subject to
litigation.  Further,  there can be no assurance that the Company will realize a
positive  return on any  acquisition  or that  future  acquisitions  will not be
dilutive to the Company's current stockholders' percentage ownership or to EPS.


CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

     The consolidated  financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with accounting  principles  generally accepted in the U.S. While the
majority of the Company's  revenues,  expenses,  assets and  liabilities are not
based on estimates,  there are certain critical accounting policies that require
management  to  make  estimates   regarding   matters  that  are  uncertain  and
susceptible to change where such change may result in a material  adverse impact
on the  Company's  financial  position and  reported  financial  results.  These
critical accounting policies are described below.  Management  regularly reviews
the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company's financial
statements for reasonableness and adequacy.

Valuation of Goodwill: Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards  (SFAS) No. 142 - Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets,  goodwill is
required to be tested for impairment at least annually,  or whenever indications
of impairment  exist. An impairment  exists when the carrying amount of goodwill
exceeds  its implied  fair value,  resulting  in an  impairment  charge for this
excess. The Company's goodwill balances, net of accumulated  amortization,  were
$811 million and $810 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     The Company has elected April 1 as its annual goodwill  impairment  testing
date.  In testing for a  potential  impairment  of  goodwill  on April 1,  2004,
management  estimated  the fair value of each of the Company's  reporting  units
(generally defined as the Company's  businesses for which financial  information
is available and reviewed  regularly by  management)  and compared this value to
the carrying  value of the  reporting  unit.  The  estimated  fair value of each
reporting  unit was greater than its carrying  value,  and therefore  management
concluded  that no amount of goodwill was impaired.  The estimated fair value of
the  reporting  units was  established  using a discounted  cash flow model that
includes  significant  assumptions  about the future operating  results and cash
flows of each reporting unit.  Adverse changes in the Company's planned business
operations such as unanticipated  competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale
of a  reporting  unit or a  significant  portion of a reporting  unit,  or other
unforeseen  developments could result in an impairment of the Company's recorded
goodwill.

Valuation and Estimated  Useful Lives of Intangible  Assets Other than Goodwill:
The Company's  intangible  assets represent  purchased assets that lack physical
substance  but can be  distinguished  from  goodwill,  principally  the value of
client  relationships.  Management  generally obtains independent  valuations to
estimate   the  initial   valuation   and  expected   amortization   period  for
client-related  intangible  assets.  These valuations are primarily based on the
present value of the  estimated  net cash flows  expected to be derived from the
client  relationships,  and assumptions about future client  attrition.  At each
balance sheet date,  management  compares the actual and estimated attrition for
client-related   intangible   assets  to  evaluate  whether   revisions  to  the
amortization period are necessary. Also, management evaluates the client-related
intangible  assets for impairment  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances
indicate  that  the  carrying  amount  of the  asset  may  not  be  recoverable.
Therefore,  higher than  expected  client  attrition may result in higher future
amortization  charges  or an  impairment  charge for  client-related  intangible
assets.   The  Company's   intangible   asset   balances,   net  of  accumulated
amortization,  were $153 million and $141 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003,
respectively.

           (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)


Restructuring   Reserves:   A  portion  of  the  reserves  under  the  Company's
restructuring  initiatives  are based on  assumptions,  including  the Company's
ability to successfully  sublease  certain real estate  properties.  The initial
restructuring  reserves and any subsequent changes in estimates of such reserves
are recorded in restructuring charges on the Company's consolidated statement of
income.  Factors and  uncertainties  which may adversely affect the estimates of
sublease income include deterioration in the respective  properties' real estate
markets,  including  Northern  California,  Texas, and New Jersey, and prolonged
vacancy  periods prior to execution of tenant  subleases.  The  Company's  total
facilities  reserves related to its restructuring  initiatives were $248 million
and $213 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     As of December 31,  2004, the remaining facilities restructuring reserve is
net of estimated  future sublease  income of  approximately  $310 million.  This
estimated  future  sublease  income amount is determined  based upon a number of
factors,  including  current and expected  commercial real estate lease rates in
the respective  properties' real estate markets,  and estimated  vacancy periods
prior to execution of tenant  subleases.  At year end,  approximately 80% of the
total square footage targeted for sublease under the  restructuring  initiatives
has been subleased, up from approximately 65% at December 31, 2003. The increase
in  subleased  square  footage is  primarily  due to the  subleasing  of certain
property in New Jersey to a real estate  investment  trust in the second quarter
of 2004, partially offset by the addition of properties as part of the 2004 cost
reduction  effort.  For a  further  discussion  on the  Company's  restructuring
reserves, see "Description of Business - Restructuring."

Pension  and  Other  Postretirement   Benefits:   Under  U.S. Trust's  trusteed,
noncontributory,  qualified defined benefit pension plan, the benefit obligation
and  related  plan  assets are based on certain  estimates  - years of  employee
service,  rate of increase in salary,  discount rate and expected rate of return
on plan assets - which are made by management with recommendations by actuaries.
In addition to the years of employee  service,  rate of increase in salary,  and
discount rate,  U.S. Trust's  postretirement  medical and life insurance benefit
obligation  is based on the health  care cost  trend rate which is an  actuarial
estimated  rate of future  increases in per capita cost of health care benefits.
The Company's benefit obligation at December 31,  2004 and 2003 was $312 million
and $283 million, respectively. The related pension expense (credit) is included
in compensation and benefits on the Company's  consolidated  statement of income
and was $7 million,  $8 million,  and less than $(1) million for 2004, 2003, and
2002, respectively.

Derivative  Instruments  and  Hedging  Activities:  As  part  of its  asset  and
liability  management  process,  the Company uses Swaps to manage  interest rate
risk.
     U.S. Trust  uses  LIBOR-based   Swaps  to  hedge  the  interest  rate  risk
associated with  U.S. Trust's  variable rate deposits from banking clients.  The
Company  has  designated  these  Swaps  as  cash  flow  hedges,  as  allowed  by
SFAS No. 133  - Accounting for Derivative  Instruments  and Hedging  Activities.
Therefore,  principally all of the cumulative  change in the fair value of these
Swaps from  inception,  totaling a net $6 million and  $33 million  liability at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, has been recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive  loss,  which is a component of  stockholders'  equity that is not
recognized  in current  earnings.  Any actual hedge  ineffectiveness,  which was
immaterial  for  2004,  is  recorded  in  interest   expense  on  the  Company's
consolidated  statement  of  income.  In  order  to  maintain  hedge  accounting
treatment,  management  performs a quarterly  assessment of its expectation that
these Swaps are effective in achieving the desired hedging results.
     Additionally,  the Company has entered into Swaps that effectively  convert
the  interest  rate  characteristics  of  a  portion  of  the  Company's  Senior
Medium-Term  Notes,  Series A  (Medium-Term  Notes) from fixed to variable.  The
Company  has  designated  such  Swaps  as  fair  value  hedges,  as  allowed  by
SFAS No. 133.  Since the notional  amount,  fixed interest rate, and maturity of
these Swaps exactly match the terms of the corresponding  Medium-Term Notes, the
Company has concluded that these Swaps are completely effective in achieving the
desired hedging results, as permitted under SFAS No. 133.  Consequently, changes
in the  fair  value  of these  Swaps,  totaling  an  aggregate  $13 million  and
$19 million asset at December 31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively,  are completely
offset  by  changes  in  the  fair  value  of  the  hedged   Medium-Term  Notes.
Accordingly,  there  has not been any  impact  on  earnings  as a result of this
hedging  program  except for the  conversion  from a fixed to a floating rate of
interest on a portion of the Medium-Term Notes.

Allowance for Credit Losses:  The Company  regularly  evaluates its portfolio of
loans to banking  clients and  provides  allowances  for the portion  management
believes may be uncollectible.  Several factors are taken into  consideration in
this evaluation  including current economic  conditions,  the composition of the
loan portfolio, past loss experience,  and risks inherent in the loan portfolio.
For Schwab Bank and U.S. Trust  portfolios,  which primarily consist of mortgage
loans,  a risk-based  methodology  is used to determine the allowance for credit
losses.  Mortgage loans are  categorized  into  portfolios by loan type and risk
characteristics. A probable loss rate, based on company and

industry  experience,  is  used to  determine  the  credit  allowance  for  each
portfolio of loans. At both December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Company's  allowance
for credit  losses was $27 million on loan  portfolios  of $6.8 billion and $5.8
billion, respectively.

Legal Reserve: The Company is subject to legal, regulatory and other proceedings
and claims arising from the conduct of its business.  The Company  establishes a
reserve  for  potential  losses that may arise out of these  proceedings  to the
extent that such losses are  probable  and can be  estimated.  The amount of the
reserve,  which is determined on a case-by-case basis,  represents the Company's
best estimate of probable  losses after  considering,  among other factors,  the
progress  of  each  case,  experience  in  similar  cases,  available  defenses,
insurance  coverage,  and the  opinions  and  views of legal  counsel.  However,
significant  judgment is required in making this estimate and the actual cost of
resolving  a claim  may be  higher  or lower  than the  amount  of the  recorded
reserve.

     The Company's  management  has discussed the  development  and selection of
these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee.  Additionally, the
Audit Committee has reviewed the Company's disclosures relating to the estimates
discussed in this Management's  Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations
and Financial Condition.

Statements - 2. Significant Accounting Policies."

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

     Market  risk is the  potential  for loss due to a change  in the value of a
financial instrument held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest
rates, equity prices, or currency exchange rates.
     The Company is exposed to interest rate risk  primarily from changes in the
interest rates on its  interest-earning  assets (mainly margin loans to clients,
investments,  loans to banking clients,  mortgage-backed  securities,  and other
fixed-rate investments) and its funding sources (including brokerage client cash
balances,   banking  deposits,   proceeds  from  stock-lending  activities,  and
long-term  debt) which finance these assets.  To mitigate the risk of loss,  the
Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines
on the  amount  of net  interest  revenue  at risk,  and by  monitoring  the net
interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning  assets and funding
sources.  The  Company  also has the ability to adjust the rates paid on certain
brokerage  client cash  balances  and  certain  banking  deposits  and the rates
charged on margin  loans.  Additionally,  the  Company  uses  Swaps to  mitigate
interest  rate  exposure  associated  with  short-term  floating   interest-rate
deposits.  The Company's exposure to equity price and currency exchange risks is
not material.
     Additional  qualitative and quantitative  disclosures about market risk are
summarized in the following  paragraphs.  See "Item 8 - Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data - Notes to Consolidated  Financial Statements - 24. Financial
Instruments  Subject to Off-Balance  Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market Risk" for
an additional discussion on market risk.


                 Financial Instruments Held For Trading Purposes

     The Company  holds fixed income  securities,  which  include  municipal and
government  securities,  and  corporate  bonds,  in inventory  to meet  clients'
trading needs.  The fair value of such inventory was  approximately  $54 million
and $74 million at December 31,  2004 and 2003, respectively.  These securities,
and the  associated  interest  rate  risk,  are not  material  to the  Company's
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.


           Financial Instruments Held For Purposes Other Than Trading

Debt Issuances
     At December 31,  2004, CSC had $386 million  aggregate  principal amount of
Medium-Term Notes  outstanding,  with fixed interest rates ranging from 6.21% to
8.05%. At December 31,  2003, CSC had $466 million aggregate principal amount of
Medium-Term Notes  outstanding,  with fixed interest rates ranging from 6.04% to
8.05%. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, U.S. Trust had $52 million Trust Preferred
Capital Securities outstanding, with a fixed interest rate of 8.41%.
     The Company has fixed cash flow requirements regarding these long-term debt
obligations  due to the  fixed  rate  of  interest.  The  fair  value  of  these
obligations at  December 31,  2004 and 2003,  based on estimates of market rates
for debt with similar  terms and  remaining  maturities,  was  $485 million  and
$584 million,   respectively,  which  approximated  their  carrying  amounts  of
$451 million and $537 million, respectively.

Interest Rate Swaps
     As part of its consolidated  asset and liability  management  process,  the
Company  utilizes  Swaps to manage  interest rate risk. For a discussion of such
Swaps,  see "Item 8 - Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data - Notes to
Consolidated  Financial  Statements  -  24.  Financial  Instruments  Subject  to
Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market Risk."

Loans Held for Sale
     Schwab  Bank's  loans  held for  sale  portfolio  consists  of  fixed-  and
adjustable-rate  mortgages,  which are  subject to a loss in value  when  market
interest  rates rise.  Schwab Bank uses forward sale  commitments to manage this
risk. At December 31, 2004, the forward sale commitments were designated as cash
flow  hedging  instruments  of the loans  held for sale.  Accordingly,  the fair
values  of  the  forward  sale   commitments   are  recorded  on  the  Company's
consolidated balance sheet, with gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive
income (loss). At December 31,  2004 and 2003, the derivative liability recorded
by Schwab Bank for these forward sale commitments was immaterial.


                         Net Interest Revenue Simulation

     The Company uses net interest  revenue  simulation  modeling  techniques to
evaluate and manage the effect of changing  interest rates. The simulation model
(the model) includes all interest-sensitive  assets and liabilities,  as well as
Swaps  utilized by the Company to hedge its interest rate risk. Key variables in
the model include assumed balance growth or decline for client loans,  deposits,
and brokerage  client cash,  changes in the level and term structure of interest
rates,  the  repricing of financial  instruments,  prepayment  and  reinvestment
assumptions,   and  product  pricing   assumptions.   The  simulations   involve
assumptions  that are inherently  uncertain and, as a result,  cannot  precisely
estimate  net

                                     - 29 -


                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION


interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on
net interest  revenue.  Actual results may differ from simulated  results due to
the timing, magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes
in market conditions and management  strategies,  including changes in asset and
liability mix.
     As  demonstrated  by  the  simulations  presented  below,  the  Company  is
positioned so that the  consolidated  balance sheet  produces an increase in net
interest  revenue when interest  rates rise and,  conversely,  a decrease in net
interest  revenue when interest  rates fall (i.e.,  interest-earning  assets are
repricing more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities).
     The  simulations in the following table assume that the asset and liability
structure of the consolidated  balance sheet would not be changed as a result of
the simulated  changes in interest  rates. As the Company  actively  manages its
consolidated  balance sheet and interest rate  exposure,  in all  likelihood the
Company  would take steps to manage any  additional  interest rate exposure that
could result from changes in the interest rate environment.  The following table
shows the results of a gradual 100 basis point  increase or decrease in interest
rates  relative to the  Company's  current base rate  forecast on simulated  net
interest revenue over the next twelve months at December 31,  2004 and 2003. The
following  table also shows the results of a gradual 200 basis point increase or
decrease in interest  rates  relative to the Company's  current  forecast of net
interest revenue over the twelve months ending December 31,  2005. Historically,
the  Company  had used a gradual 200 basis  point  change  when  evaluating  its
sensitivity;  however,  the Company  changed to a 100 basis point  simulation in
December 2001 due to low levels of interest rates.  Given the recent increase in
interest  rates,  the Company will again report its  interest  rate  sensitivity
using a gradual 200 basis point change.

     The down 100 basis  point  simulation  shows  reduced  exposure  to falling
interest rates at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003.  This reduced
sensitivity  results from higher  interest  rates and an expectation of interest
rates  continuing  to  increase,  both of which  lessen  the  impact  of  spread
compression between  interest-earning  assets and brokerage client cash balances
and banking deposits.

                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
              (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data,
                  Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)


1.  Introduction and Basis of Presentation

     The  Charles  Schwab  Corporation  (CSC)  is a  financial  holding  company
engaged, through its subsidiaries, in securities brokerage, banking, and related
financial  services.  Charles  Schwab  &  Co.,  Inc.  (Schwab)  is a  securities
broker-dealer with 236 domestic branch offices in 43 states, as well as a branch
in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. U.S. Trust  Corporation  (USTC, and with its
subsidiaries collectively referred to as U.S. Trust) is a wealth management firm
that  through its  subsidiaries  also  provides  fiduciary  services and private
banking  services  with 37  offices  in 15 states.  Other  subsidiaries  include
Charles Schwab Investment Management,  Inc., the investment advisor for Schwab's
proprietary mutual funds, CyberTrader, Inc. (CyberTrader), an electronic trading
technology  and  brokerage  firm  providing  services to highly  active,  online
traders, and Charles Schwab Bank, N.A. (Schwab Bank), a retail bank.
     The consolidated  financial  statements  include CSC and its majority-owned
subsidiaries  (collectively  referred  to as the  Company).  These  consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles
generally  accepted  in the  U.S.,  which  require  management  to make  certain
estimates and assumptions  that affect the reported  amounts in the accompanying
financial statements. Such estimates relate to capitalized development costs for
internal-use  software;  useful lives of intangible  assets,  equipment,  office
facilities, and property;  valuation of goodwill,  intangible assets, and equity
investments;  valuation  of  employee  stock  options;  fair value of  financial
instruments  and  investments;  allowance  for credit  losses on banking  loans;
allowance  for  doubtful   accounts  of  brokerage   clients;   retirement   and
postretirement benefits; future tax benefits;  restructuring reserves; and legal
reserves.  Actual results could differ from such estimates.  Certain  prior-year
amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation. All material
intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.
     The Company  completed the sale of its capital markets business in 2004 and
the sale of its U.K. brokerage business in 2003. These financial statements have
been adjusted to reflect these businesses as discontinued  operations.  See note
"5 - Discontinued Operations" for further discussion of these sales.


2.  Significant Accounting Policies

Securities  transactions:  Clients' securities  transactions are recorded on the
date that they settle,  while the related  commission  revenues and expenses are
recorded on the date that the trade occurs.  Principal transactions are recorded
on a trade date basis.

Cash and cash equivalents:  The Company considers all highly liquid investments,
including  money market funds,  interest-bearing  deposits  with banks,  federal
funds sold,  commercial paper and treasury securities,  with original maturities
of three  months or less that are not  segregated  and on deposit for federal or
other regulatory purposes to be cash equivalents.

Cash and investments  segregated and on deposit for federal or other  regulatory
purposes  consist  primarily of securities  purchased under agreements to resell
(resale agreements), which are collateralized by U.S. government securities, and
certificates  of  deposit.   Resale  agreements  are  collateralized   investing
transactions  that  are  recorded  at their  contractual  amounts  plus  accrued
interest.   The  Company  obtains  possession  of  collateral  (U.S.  government
securities)  with a market value equal to or in excess of the  principal  amount
loaned and accrued interest under resale agreements.  Collateral is valued daily
by the Company, with additional collateral obtained when necessary. Certificates
of deposit are recorded at market value.

Securities borrowed,  securities loaned, and securities sold under agreements to
repurchase (repurchase  agreements):  Securities borrowed require the Company to
deliver  cash to the lender in  exchange  for  securities  and are  included  in
receivables  from brokers,  dealers and clearing  organizations.  For securities
loaned,  the  Company  receives  collateral  in the  form of  cash in an  amount
generally equal to the market value of securities loaned.  Securities loaned are
included in payables to brokers, dealers and clearing organizations. The Company
monitors the market value of  securities  borrowed and loaned,  with  additional
collateral  obtained or  refunded  when  necessary.  Repurchase  agreements  are
recorded at their contractual  amounts plus accrued interest and are included in
short-term borrowings.

Securities  owned  include  securities  available  for sale that are recorded at
estimated fair value using quoted market prices, where available, or third-party
pricing  services.  Unrealized  gains and losses are reported,  net of taxes, in
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) included in stockholders'  equity.
Realized  gains and  losses  from  sales of  securities

                                     - 36 -


                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
              (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data,
                  Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)


available  for sale are  determined on a specific  identification  basis and are
included in other revenues.
     Securities  owned also include equity,  fixed income and other  securities,
SchwabFunds(R)  money  market  funds,  and equity and bond mutual  funds and are
recorded at estimated  fair value.  Unrealized  gains and losses are included in
principal transaction revenues.

Receivables  from  brokerage  clients are stated net of  allowance  for doubtful
accounts  of  $1 million   and  $2 million  at   December 31,   2004  and  2003,
respectively.  Cash receivables from brokerage  clients that remain unsecured or
partially secured for more than 30 days are fully reserved.

Nonperforming  assets  included  in the  loan  portfolio  consist  of  financial
instruments  where  the  Company  has  stopped  accruing  interest  (non-accrual
financial  instruments).  Interest  accruals are discontinued  when principal or
interest is contractually past due 90 days or more unless  collectibility of the
loan is reasonably  assured.  Non-accrual  financial  instruments  are generally
returned  to accrual  status only when all  delinquent  principal  and  interest
payments become current and the  collectibility of future principal and interest
on a timely basis is reasonably assured.

Loans to  banking  clients  are  stated net of  allowance  for credit  losses of
$27 million  at both  December 31,  2004 and 2003.  The allowance is established
through  charges to income based on  management's  evaluation of the adequacy of
the allowance for credit losses in the existing  portfolio.
     The adequacy of the allowance is reviewed  regularly by management,  taking
into  consideration  current  economic  conditions,  the existing loan portfolio
composition, past loss experience and risks inherent in the portfolio, including
the value of impaired loans.

Loans held for sale consist of fixed-rate  and  adjustable-rate  mortgage  loans
intended  for sale.  Loans  held for sale are  stated at lower of cost or market
value. Market value is determined using quoted market prices.

Equipment,  office facilities and property:  Equipment and office facilities are
depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset
of three to ten years.  Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line  basis over
twenty years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over
the lesser of the  estimated  useful life of the asset or the term of the lease.
Software and certain costs  incurred for  purchasing or developing  software for
internal use are  amortized on a  straight-line  basis over an estimated  useful
life of three or five years.  Equipment,  office  facilities  and  property  are
stated at cost net of  accumulated  depreciation  and  amortization,  except for
land,  which is stated at cost.  Equipment,  office  facilities and property are
reviewed for impairment  whenever  events or changes in  circumstances  indicate
that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.

Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value
based  upon  dealer  quotes and  third-party  pricing  services.  As part of its
consolidated  asset and  liability  management  process,  the  Company  utilizes
interest  rate swap  agreements  (Swaps)  to manage  interest  rate risk of both
fixed-rate and variable-rate  financial  instruments.  The Company applies hedge
accounting to these swaps and therefore gains and losses are generally  deferred
and  recognized  in interest  expense to offset the impact of changing  interest
rates on the hedged  financial  instruments.  For  further  discussion  on these
derivative financial  instruments,  see note "24 - Financial Instruments Subject
to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or Market Risk."

Income taxes:  The Company files a consolidated  U.S.  federal income tax return
and uses the asset and liability method in recording  income tax expense.  Under
this method,  deferred  tax assets and  liabilities  are recorded for  temporary
differences  between the tax basis of assets and  liabilities and their recorded
amounts for financial reporting purposes, using currently enacted tax law.

Stock-based  compensation:  The  Company  applies  Accounting  Principles  Board
Opinion  (APB) No. 25 - Accounting  for Stock Issued to  Employees,  and related
interpretations,  for its stock-based  employee  compensation plans. Because the
Company  grants stock option  awards at market value,  there is no  compensation
expense  recorded  when the awards are  granted.  Expense is  recognized  if the
original  terms of an award are  subsequently  modified,  which has  occurred in
connection with restructuring and severance activities. Compensation expense for
restricted  stock awards is based on the market  value of the shares  awarded at
the date of grant and is  amortized  on a  straight-line  basis over the vesting
period.  The  unamortized  portion  of the  award  is  recorded  as  unamortized
stock-based compensation in stockholders' equity.
     The Company changed its option pricing model from the  Black-Scholes  model
to a binomial  model for all options  granted on or after  January 1,  2004. The
fair values of stock options  granted prior to January 1,  2004 were  determined
using the  Black-Scholes  model.  The Company  believes that the binomial  model
offers greater  flexibility in reflecting the  characteristics of employee stock
options. The binomial model takes into account similar inputs to a Black-Scholes
model such as volatility,  dividend yield rate, and risk-free

                                     - 37 -

interest rate. In addition to these  assumptions,  the binomial model  considers
the  contractual  term of the option,  the  probability  that the option will be
exercised  prior to the end of its  contractual  life,  and the  probability  of
termination  or  retirement  of the option  holder in computing the value of the
option. The Company determines these  probabilities  generally based on analysis
of historical  trends of such events.  The  weighted-average  of the assumptions
used in the respective option pricing models were as follows:

(1)  Reflects a decrease in the  contractual  term and  vesting  period for 2004
     stock option grants.

     Had  compensation  expense  for the  Company's  stock  option  awards  been
determined  based on the  Black-Scholes  or binomial  fair value,  as  described
above, at the grant dates for awards under those plans  consistent with the fair
value method of Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  (SFAS) No. 123  -
Accounting  for  Stock-Based  Compensation,  the  Company  would  have  recorded
additional  compensation expense and its net income and earnings per share (EPS)
would have been  reduced to the pro forma  amounts  presented  in the  following
table:


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                      2004      2003      2002

    Pro forma                                       $  .15    $  .27    $ (.02)
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  Includes  compensation  expense  related  to  restricted  stock  awards  of
     $37 million, $18  million,  and  $14  million  in  2004,  2003,  and  2002,
     respectively.
(2)  Includes pro forma compensation expense related to stock options granted in
     both  current and prior  years.  Pro forma  stock  option  compensation  is
     amortized  on a basis  consistent  with the vesting  terms over the vesting
     period beginning with the month in which the option was granted.

Goodwill  represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the fair value
of the related net assets  acquired.  Goodwill is tested for impairment at least
annually or whenever indications of impairment exist. In testing for a potential
impairment  of  goodwill,  management  estimates  the fair  value of each of the
Company's  reporting units  (generally  defined as the Company's  businesses for
which financial  information is available and reviewed regularly by management),
and  compares  it to their  carrying  value.  If the  estimated  fair value of a
reporting  unit is less than its  carrying  value,  management  is  required  to
estimate the fair value of all assets and  liabilities  of the  reporting  unit,
including  goodwill.  If the carrying value of the reporting  unit's goodwill is
greater than the estimated  fair value,  an impairment  charge is recognized for
the excess.  The Company has elected  April 1 as its annual  impairment  testing
date.
     The  carrying  amount of  goodwill  attributable  to each of the  Company's
reportable segments is presented in the following table:


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

================================================================================

     Changes in the  carrying  amount of  goodwill  associated  with the capital
markets  business,  which  was  sold  in  2004,  are  discussed  in  note  "5  -
Discontinued Operations" and note "6 - Business Acquisitions and Divestitures."

Intangible  assets  consist  primarily  of  purchased  client  accounts.   These
intangible  assets  have finite  lives and are  amortized  over their  estimated
useful lives and subject to  impairment  testing  whenever  events or changes in
circumstances  indicate that their carrying  amount may not be  recoverable.  In
testing for a potential  impairment of intangible  assets,  management  assesses
whether  the  future  cash flows  related to the asset will be greater  than its
carrying value at the time of the test. Accordingly, the process of evaluating a
potential impairment is based on estimates and is subjective.
     The Company's gross amortizing  intangible asset balances were $145 million
and  $138 million  at  December 31,  2004 and  2003,  respectively.  Accumulated
amortization  relating to these intangible assets was $11 million and $2 million
at December 31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively.  These  intangible  assets have a
weighted-average  estimated  useful  life  of 20  years.  The  Company  recorded
amortization  expense of $9 million,  $2 million,  and $4 million in 2004, 2003,
and 2002,  respectively,  related to these intangible  assets.  Estimated future
amortization expense for these intangible assets is approximately $10 million in
each of 2005

and 2006, and approximately $7 million in each of 2007, 2008, and 2009.
     Additionally,   the  Company  has  certain   intangible  assets  which  are
non-amortizing  but are subject to impairment  testing as described  above.  The
Company's   non-amortizing   intangible  asset  balances  were  $19 million  and
$5 million  at  December 31,  2004 and  2003,  respectively,  and are  primarily
comprised of the value of contracts  acquired in 2004 to manage  investments  of
mutual funds.

Variable  interest  entities:  Upon adoption of Financial  Accounting  Standards
Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 46 - Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities,
an  Interpretation  of  Accounting   Research  Bulletin  No. 51  -  Consolidated
Financial  Statements,  in the first quarter of 2003, the Company consolidated a
special purpose trust (Trust) and recorded a note payable of $235 million.  This
Trust was formed in 2000 to finance the  acquisition and renovation of an office
building and land.  In June 2004,  the Company  exercised its option to purchase
this  property  from the  Trust  and  repaid  $99 million  of the note  payable.
Simultaneously,  the  Company  completed a  transaction  on this  property  with
American Financial Realty Trust, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust,
resulting in proceeds of $136 million,  which was used to repay the remainder of
the note payable,  and a 20-year lease.  This transaction was accounted for as a
financing.   The  remaining  lease   financing   liability  of  $134 million  at
December 31,  2004 is being reduced by a portion of the lease  payments over the
20-year term.

New  accounting   standards:   SEC  Staff  Accounting   Bulletin  (SAB)  No. 105
"Application of Accounting Principles to Loan Commitments" was released in March
2004. This release  summarizes the SEC staff position  regarding the application
of GAAP to loan commitments accounted for as derivative instruments. The Company
accounts for interest rate lock  commitments  issued on mortgage loans that will
be held for sale as derivative  instruments.  Consistent with  SAB No. 105,  the
Company  considers  the  fair  value  of  these  commitments  to be  zero at the
commitment  date, with  subsequent  changes in fair value  determined  solely on
changes in market  interest  rates.  As of  December 31,  2004,  the Company had
interest  rate  lock  commitments  on  mortgage  loans to be held for sale  with
principal balances totaling approximately $110 million,  the fair value of which
was immaterial.
     Emerging  Issues  Task  Force  Issue   (EITF) No. 03-01   "The  Meaning  of
Other-Than-Temporary  Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments" was
ratified by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in March 2004.  This
EITF addresses how to determine the meaning of  other-than-temporary  impairment
and its application to investments  classified as either  available-for-sale  or
held-to-maturity    under   Statement   of   Financial    Accounting   Standards
(SFAS) No. 115  -  Accounting  for  Certain   Investments  in  Debt  and  Equity
Securities  (including  individual  securities and investments in mutual funds),
and  investments  accounted for under the cost method or the equity  method.  In
September  2004, the FASB delayed the effective date of the portion of this EITF
that relates to measuring and recognizing  other-than-temporary impairment until
implementation   guidance  is  finalized.   This  delay  does  not  suspend  the
requirement to recognize  other-than-temporary  impairment  required by existing
accounting literature.
     A revision to SFAS No. 123, Share-Based  Payment,  which supersedes APB No.
25 (SFAS  No. 123R)  and was issued in December  2004,  requires  that the  cost
resulting  from all  share-based  payments  be  recognized  as an expense in the
consolidated  financial  statements,  and also  changes  the  classification  of
certain tax benefits in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The Company is
required to adopt SFAS No. 123R on July 1,  2005.  The Company has  historically
recorded compensation expense for all restricted stock awards.  Beginning in the
third quarter of 2005, the Company will record compensation expense for unvested
stock option awards over the future periods in which the awards vest. Based upon
stock options  outstanding at December 31,  2004, pre-tax  compensation  expense
related to stock option awards would be approximately $22 million,  $23 million,
and  $10 million  in the  second  half of 2005  and  full-year  2006  and  2007,
respectively,  which  equates to a decrease in EPS of $.01 in the second half of
2005 and  full-year  2006.  The amount and timing of total  future  compensation
expense related to stock option grants will vary based upon  additional  awards,
if any,  cancellations,  forfeitures,  or modifications of existing awards,  and
employee severance terms.

2004 Cost Reduction Effort

     In the second  quarter of 2004,  the Company  commenced  a  firm-wide  cost
reduction  effort  designed  to  mitigate  the  financial  impact of its pricing
changes and to strengthen its  productivity  and  efficiency.  The goals of this
effort include  eliminating work that is not essential to meeting client service
standards or the Company's ongoing operating needs, reengineering work processes
to  maximize   productivity,   minimizing   organizational   complexity  through
functional  streamlining,  and addressing  business unit performance  across the
Company.  During 2004, the Company  reallocated certain client service functions
from its Orlando regional telephone service center to other centers. The Company
also closed or consolidated 111 branch offices,  began opening smaller satellite
offices in  selected  locations,  and took steps to  streamline  its  technology
organization.  Additionally,  the  Company  reduced  its  operating  facilities,
primarily by exiting certain administrative office space in California.
     The Company recorded pre-tax  restructuring charges of $211 million in 2004
related to the 2004 cost reduction effort,  primarily reflecting severance costs
for approximately 1,600 employees and facilities reduction charges.
     A summary of pre-tax  restructuring  charges  related to the Company's 2004
cost reduction effort is as follows:

     reduction  reserve through cash payments for the net lease expense over the
     respective lease terms through 2014.

2003, 2002, and 2001 Initiatives

     The Company's  2003,  2002,  and 2001  restructuring  initiatives  included
workforce reductions, reductions in operating facilities, the removal of certain
systems hardware,  software and equipment from service,  and the withdrawal from
certain international  operations.  These initiatives reduced operating expenses
and   adjusted   the   Company's   organizational   structure  to  help  improve
productivity,  enhance  efficiency,  and increase  profitability.  In 2004,  the
Company  recorded  pre-tax  restructuring  charges of $3 million  related to its
2003,  2002,  and 2001  restructuring  initiatives,  primarily due to changes in
estimates of sublease income  associated with  previously  announced  efforts to
sublease excess facilities.  In 2003, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring
charges of $76 million related to these

(1)  Primarily  includes  charges for  officers'  stock-based  compensation  and
     write-downs of fixed assets.
(2)  Primarily  includes the  accretion of  facilities  restructuring  reserves,
     which are initially  recorded at net present  value.  Accretion  expense is
     recorded in occupancy and equipment  expense on the Company's  consolidated
     statement of income.
(3)  Relates to the Company's 2003 restructuring initiative. The Company expects
     to substantially  utilize the remaining workforce reduction reserve through
     cash payments for severance pay and benefits over the respective  severance
     periods through 2005.
(4)  Includes $5 million,  $62 million, and $75 million related to the Company's
     2003, 2002, and 2001 restructuring initiatives,  respectively.  The Company
     expects to substantially utilize the remaining facilities reduction reserve
     through cash payments for the net lease expense over the  respective  lease
     terms through 2017.

     The actual costs of these  restructuring  initiatives could differ from the
estimated  costs,  depending  primarily  on the  Company's  ability to  sublease
properties.


4.  Sale of Corporate Trust Business

     In 2001,  U.S. Trust  sold its Corporate  Trust business to The Bank of New
York Company, Inc. In 2002, the Company recorded a pre-tax extraordinary gain of
$22 million,  or $12 million after tax, which represented the remaining proceeds
from this sale that were realized upon  satisfaction of certain client retention
requirements.


5.  Discontinued Operations

     On October 29,  2004, the Company completed the sale of its capital markets
business to UBS Securities LLC and UBS Americas Inc.  (collectively  referred to
as UBS). Pursuant to the purchase agreement, UBS acquired all of the partnership
interests of Schwab  Capital  Markets L.P.  and all of the  outstanding  capital
stock of SoundView  Technology Group, Inc.  (collectively  referred to as Schwab
Soundview  Capital Markets,  or SSCM) for $265 million in cash. At closing,  the
Company and Schwab entered into eight-year order routing and execution  services
agreements with UBS for the handling of Schwab's equity and listed options order
flow. The Company has deferred  $28 million of the purchase price,  representing
the fair value of these  services  agreements,  to be recognized as revenue over
the eight-year term on a straight-line  basis. SSCM comprised  substantially all
of the previously-reported Capital Markets segment.
     The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of SSCM have
been  presented as  discontinued  operations on the  consolidated  statements of
income and of cash flows,  respectively,  and the assets and liabilities of SSCM
prior  to the  sale  have  each  been  combined  and  presented  as  assets  and
liabilities of discontinued  operations on the  consolidated  balance sheet. The
Company's consolidated prior period revenues, expenses, taxes on income, assets,
liabilities, and cash flows have been adjusted to reflect this presentation.
     The carrying amounts of SSCM assets and liabilities included as part of the
sale are as follows:

     reduction  reserve through cash payments for the net lease expense over the
     respective lease terms through 2015.

     In January  2004,  as part of the  Company's  purchase  accounting  for the
acquisition  of  SoundView  Technology  Group,  Inc.  (SoundView),  the  Company
recorded a $29  million  liability  for  above-market  lease  rates for  certain
facilities  leases  expiring  through 2011. At December 31, 2004,  the remaining
liability was $23 million.

impairment  exists is a matter of judgment.  Factors  considered  in  evaluating
whether  a decline  in value is other  than  temporary  include:  the  financial
conditions  and  near-term  prospects of the issuer;  the  Company's  intent and
ability to retain the  investment  for a period of time  sufficient to allow for
any  anticipated  recovery;  and the  length of time and the extent to which the
fair value has been less than cost.

(1)  Collateralized  mortgage  obligations  have been  allocated  over  maturity
     groupings based on contractual  maturities.  Expected maturities may differ
     from  contractual  maturities  because  borrowers  have the right to prepay
     obligations with or without prepayment penalties.
(2)  Yields have been computed by dividing  annualized  interest  revenue,  on a
     taxable   equivalent  basis,  by  the  amortized  cost  of  the  respective
     securities at December 31, 2004.

     The  Company's positions in  SchwabFunds(R)  money  market funds arise from
certain overnight funding of clients' redemption,  check-writing, and debit card
activities.   Fixed  income   securities  are  held  to  meet  clients'  trading
activities. Equity and bond mutual funds include investments made by the Company
relating  to  its  deferred   compensation  plan  and  inventory  maintained  to
facilitate   certain   SchwabFunds   and   third-party   mutual  fund   clients'
transactions.
     Securities  sold, but not yet purchased,  of $16 million and $20 million at
December 31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively,  consist  primarily  of mutual  fund
shares that are  distributed to clients to satisfy their  dividend  reinvestment
requests.  These securities are recorded at market value in accrued expenses and
other liabilities.


8.  Receivables from Brokerage Clients

     Receivables  from brokerage  clients  consist  primarily of margin loans to
brokerage  clients of $9.8 billion  and  $8.5 billion  at December 31,  2004 and
2003, respectively. Securities owned by brokerage clients are held as collateral
for margin loans. Such collateral is not reflected in the consolidated financial
statements.

================================================================================

     Included in the loan portfolio are non-accrual loans totaling $1 million at
both December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  Non-accrual loans are considered
impaired by the Company, and represent all the Company's nonperforming assets at
both  December 31,  2004 and 2003.  For 2004 and 2003,  the  impact of  interest
revenue  which  would have been  earned on  non-accrual  loans  versus  interest
revenue  recognized on these loans was not material to the Company's  results of
operations.
     The amount of loans accruing  interest that were  contractually  90 days or
more past due was  $4 million  and  $1 million  at  December 31,  2004 and 2003,
respectively.

10. Loan Securitizations

     In the fourth quarters of 2004 and 2003,  U.S. Trust sold  $1.0 billion and
$354 million, respectively, of residential mortgage loans originated through its
private   banking   business   in   securitization   transactions.    In   these
securitizations,   U.S.  Trust  retained  a  portion  of  the  senior   mortgage
pass-through  certificates and all subordinated  pass-through  certificates that
were created by the securitization  process (the retained  securities),  and the
servicing rights.  U.S. Trust received proceeds of $1.0 billion and $355 million
from  these  securitizations  in 2004 and  2003,  respectively,  reacquired  the
retained securities of $820 million and $7 million, respectively, and recognized
immaterial net gains after payment of transaction expenses. These securitization
transactions are accounted for as sales under the requirements of SFAS No. 140 -
Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial  Assets and  Extinguishments
of Liabilities.
     The fair values of the retained  securities  at the date of  securitization
were primarily determined based on the following key economic assumptions:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                              2004        2003
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Average discount rate                                         4.5%        6.4%
Constant prepayment rate (1)                                   25%         n/a
Prepayment speed assumption (2)                                n/a        300%
Expected weighted average life (in years)                      2.4         6.0
Expected credit losses                                          0%          0%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  Constant   prepayment   rate  and  constant   prepayment  rate  to  balloon
     methodologies were used.
(2)  Based upon the Public Securities Association convention,  a 300% prepayment
     speed assumption equates to an increasing  constant prepayment rate from 0%
     to 18% over the initial 30 month loan term and 18% thereafter.
n/a  Not applicable.

     The estimated fair values of the retained  securities were $805 million and
$12 million at December 31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively,  and were included in
securities owned on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of
the  servicing  rights  were  immaterial.  Key  economic  assumptions,  and  the
sensitivities of the current fair value of retained  securities related to these
securitizations to immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, are presented
in the table below.

(1)  Constant   prepayment   rate  and  constant   prepayment  rate  to  balloon
     methodologies were used.

     The  sensitivity  analysis  above is  hypothetical  and should be used with
caution.  Changes in fair value based on a variation  in  assumptions  generally
cannot be extrapolated  because the relationship of the change in the assumption
to the change in fair value may not be linear.  Also,  in the table  above,  the
effect  of a  variation  in a  particular  assumption  on the fair  value of the
retained  interest  is  calculated  independently  without  changing  any  other
assumption. In practice, changes in one factor may result in changes in another,
which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities.
     Cash flows  received  from the retained  securities  were  $28 million  and
$1 million in 2004 and 2003,  respectively.  Cash flows  received from servicing
fees were immaterial in both 2004 and 2003.
     Any credit losses on the securitized  loans are assigned to U.S. Trust,  as
holder  of the  subordinated  securities,  up to the par  value.  There  were no
delinquencies in the securitized  mortgage loans at December 31,  2004 and 2003,
and there were no losses for either 2004 or 2003.  U.S. Trust has not guaranteed
the mortgage  loans as these  transactions  are structured  without  recourse to
U.S. Trust or the Company.

12. Deposits from Banking Clients

     Deposits  from banking  clients  consist of money market and other  savings
deposits,  certificates of deposit, and noninterest-bearing  deposits.  Deposits
from banking clients are as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
December 31,                                                  2004        2003

Interest-bearing deposits (1)                              $10,280     $ 7,585
Noninterest-bearing deposits                                   838         723
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Total                                                    $11,118     $ 8,308
================================================================================

(1)  Includes  certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more totaling $340 million
     and $886 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

     During the years  ended  December  31, 2004 and 2003,  the Company  paid an
average rate of 1.15% and 1.79%, respectively,  on its interest-bearing deposits
from banking clients.


13. Payables to Brokers, Dealers and Clearing Organizations

     Payables to brokers,  dealers and clearing  organizations consist primarily
of securities  loaned of $1.4 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31,  2004 and
2003,  respectively.  The cash  collateral  received from  counterparties  under
securities lending transactions was equal to or greater than the market value of
the securities loaned.


14. Payables to Brokerage Clients

     The  principal  source of  funding  for  Schwab's  margin  lending  is cash
balances in brokerage client accounts.  At December 31,  2004, Schwab was paying
interest at 1.2% on $23.9 billion of cash balances in brokerage client accounts,
which were  included in payables to brokerage  clients.  At  December 31,  2003,
Schwab was paying interest at .2% on $23.8 billion of such cash balances.


15. Short-term Borrowings

     CSC may  borrow up to  $800 million  under a  committed,  unsecured  credit
facility  with a group  of  nineteen  banks  which is  scheduled  to  expire  in
June 2005. CSC plans to establish a similar facility to replace this one when it
expires.  This facility replaced a facility that expired in June 2004. The funds
under this facility are available for general corporate  purposes and CSC pays a
commitment fee on the unused balance of this facility.  The financial  covenants
in this  facility  require  CSC to  maintain  a minimum  level of  stockholders'
equity,  Schwab to maintain  minimum net capital ratios,  as defined,  and CSC's
depository  institution  subsidiaries to be well capitalized,  as defined. These
facilities were unused at December 31, 2004 and 2003.
     To manage short-term  liquidity,  Schwab maintains  uncommitted,  unsecured
bank  credit  lines  with a  group  of  eight  banks  totaling  $831 million  at
December 31,  2004. CSC has access to  $781 million  of these credit lines.  The
amount  available to CSC under these lines is lower than the amount available to
Schwab  because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available
to  Schwab.   There  were  no  borrowings   outstanding  under  these  lines  at
December 31, 2004 and 2003.

              (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data,
                  Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)


     To satisfy the margin  requirement of client option  transactions  with the
Options  Clearing  Corporation  (OCC),  Schwab  has  unsecured  letter of credit
agreements  with  nine  banks in favor of the OCC  aggregating  $630 million  at
December 31,  2004.  Schwab  pays  a fee  to  maintain  these  arrangements.  In
connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide
collateral  to  certain  brokerage  clients.  Schwab  satisfies  the  collateral
requirements by arranging  letters of credit (LOCs), in favor of these brokerage
clients,  that are  guaranteed by multiple  banks.  At  December 31,  2004,  the
outstanding value of these LOCs totaled  $52 million.  No funds were drawn under
these LOCs at December 31, 2004 and 2003.
     Other  short-term   borrowings   include  Federal  Home  Loan  Bank  System
borrowings,  federal funds purchased,  repurchase agreements, and other borrowed
funds. At December 31,  2004 and 2003, these other short-term borrowings totaled
$663 million and  $996 million,  respectively,  with  weighted-average  interest
rates ranging from 2.13% to 2.50% and .87% to 1.22%, respectively.


16. Long-term Debt

     Long-term debt consists of the following:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  Represents the fair value adjustment  related to hedged  Medium-Term Notes.
     See note "24 - Financial  Instruments  Subject to  Off-Balance  Sheet Risk,
     Credit Risk or Market Risk."

     The  aggregate  principal  amount of  Senior  Medium-Term  Notes,  Series A
(Medium-Term Notes) outstanding at December 31, 2004 had maturities ranging from
2005 to 2010. The aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes outstanding at
December 31, 2004 and 2003 had fixed interest rates ranging from 6.21% to 8.05%,
and 6.04% to 8.05%, respectively. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the Medium-Term
Notes carried a weighted-average interest rate of 7.46% and 7.31%, respectively.
     Upon  adoption  of FIN  No. 46 in the first  quarter of 2003,  the  Company
consolidated a Trust and recorded a note payable of $235 million. This Trust was
formed in 2000 to finance the  acquisition  and renovation of an office building
and land.  In June 2004,  the  Company  exercised  its option to  purchase  this
property   from  the  Trust  and  repaid   $99 million   of  the  note  payable.
Simultaneously,  the  Company  completed a  transaction  on this  property  with
American Financial Realty Trust, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust,
resulting in proceeds of $136 million,  which was used to repay the remainder of
the note payable,  and a 20-year lease.  This transaction was accounted for as a
financing.   The  remaining  lease   financing   liability  of  $134 million  at
December 31,  2004 is being reduced by a portion of the lease  payments over the
20-year term.
     The Trust  Preferred  Capital  Securities  qualify as tier 1 capital  under
guidelines  of the Board of Governors  of the Federal  Reserve  System  (Federal
Reserve Board) and have no voting rights. Holders of the Trust Preferred Capital
Securities are entitled to receive cumulative cash distributions  semi-annually.
The Company has the right to redeem the Trust Preferred Capital Securities prior
to their stated maturity of February 1, 2027, on or after February 1, 2007, upon
approval (if then required) of the Federal Reserve Board.
     Annual maturities on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 are as
follows:

     The above  amounts do not include tax benefits or expense from the exercise
of  stock  options  and the  vesting  of  restricted  stock  awards,  which  for
accounting purposes are recorded in additional paid-in capital. Such tax amounts
totaled a net tax benefit of $16 million in 2004, compared to net tax expense of
$3 million in 2003 and a net tax benefit of $4 million in 2002.
     The income tax benefit  related to loss from  discontinued  operations  was
$71 million, $2 million, and $28 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.
     The temporary differences that created deferred tax assets and liabilities,
included in other assets, are detailed below:

(1)  Consists  primarily  of net  operating  losses in New York  State that will
     expire  in 2022  through  2024.  Realization  is  dependent  on  generating
     sufficient taxable income in New York State prior to the expiration of such
     losses.

     The Company  determined that no valuation  allowance  against  deferred tax
assets at  December 31,  2004 and 2003 was necessary.
     The effective income tax rate on income from continuing  operations differs
from the amount  computed by applying the federal  statutory  income tax rate as
follows:

18. Employee Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plans

Stock Option Plans

     The  Company's  stock  incentive  plans  provide  for  granting  options to
employees,  officers,  and  directors.  Options are granted for the  purchase of
shares of common  stock at an exercise  price not less than market  value on the
date of grant,  and  expire  within  seven or ten years  from the date of grant.
Options generally vest over a three- to four-year period from the date of grant.
     A summary of option activity follows:

     Options outstanding and exercisable are as follows:



Restricted Stock and Long-term Incentive Plans

     The Company's stock incentive plans provide for granting  restricted  stock
awards to employees and officers.  Restricted  stock awards are restricted  from
transfer or sale and generally vest over a four-year period, but some vest based
upon the Company achieving certain financial or other measures.
     The Company also awards eligible officers  long-term  incentive plan (LTIP)
units and restricted stock under a long-term incentive program. These awards are
restricted  from transfer or sale and generally  vest over a three- to four-year
period.  The cash payout of the LTIP units at the end of the  vesting  period is
based  upon the  Company  achieving  certain  cumulative  EPS  levels.  The LTIP
liability  was  $24 million  and  $9 million  at  December 31,  2004  and  2003,
respectively.
    Restricted stock and LTIP unit information is as follows:

Other Deferred Compensation Plans

     The Company  sponsors  deferred  compensation  plans for both  officers and
non-employee  directors.  The Company's deferred  compensation plan for officers
permits  participants  to defer the payment of certain  cash  compensation.  The
deferred   compensation   liability  was   $221 million   and   $207 million  at
December 31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively.  The Company's deferred compensation
plan for non-employee  directors permits participants to defer receipt of all or
a  portion  of  their  directors'  fees and to  receive  either a grant of stock
options,  or upon ceasing to serve as a director,  the number of shares of CSC's
common stock that would have  resulted  from  investing  the deferred fee amount
into CSC's common stock.


19. Retirement and Other Employee Benefit Plans

     The Company's  retirement and other employee benefit plans consist of CSC's
and  U.S. Trust's  plans that were in effect  prior to the  merger  with USTC in
2000. The following summarizes such plans.

Retirement Plans

     Eligible employees of the Company who have met certain service requirements
may  participate in the Company's  qualified retirement plan,  the SchwabPlan(R)
401(k)  Retirement  Savings and Investment  Plan  (SchwabPlan).  The Company may
match certain employee  contributions  or make additional  contributions to this
plan at its discretion.  Total company  contribution  expense was $48 million in
2004,  $3 million  in 2003,  and  $47 million  in 2002.  In  2004,  the  Company
reinstated its 401(k) employee  contribution  match, which was suspended in 2003
(except for a discretionary award to certain  non-officer  employees made in the
fourth quarter of 2003).
     U.S.  Trust  previously  sponsored  a 401(k)  Plan and  ESOP  covering  all
eligible  U.S. Trust  employees.  U.S.  Trust  terminated  this plan,  effective
December  2003,  and  merged  the  plan  assets  into  the   SchwabPlan.   Total
contribution  expense  under  this  plan was $9  million  in 2002.  There was no
contribution expense in 2003 as U.S. Trust suspended  contributions beginning in
the first quarter of 2003.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits

     U.S. Trust maintains a trustee managed, noncontributory,  qualified defined
benefit  pension  plan for the benefit of  eligible  U.S. Trust  employees,  the
U.S. Trust Corporation Employees' Retirement Plan (the Pension Plan).
     U.S. Trust  provides  certain health care and life  insurance  benefits for
active employees and certain  qualifying retired employees and their dependents.
Postretirement  medical and life insurance benefits are accrued during the years
that the  employee  renders  service to reflect the  expected  cost of providing
health  care  and  life  insurance  and  other  benefits  to  an  employee  upon
retirement.
     The  following   table   summarizes   the   components  of  retirement  and
postretirement  benefit  expenses  (credits),  the funded status of U.S. Trust's
qualified  retirement plan, changes in the benefit  obligations related to these
plans and the major assumptions used to determine these amounts.

                                     - 49 -





                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
              (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data,
                  Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)


     The  accumulated  benefit  obligation for the Pension Plan was $311 million
and $283 million at September 30, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, U.S.
Trust  considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments
(primarily  government  bonds),  the historical level of risk premium associated
with other classes in which the portfolio is invested and the  expectations  for
future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was
then  weighted  based on the target  asset  allocation  to develop the  expected
long-term rate of return on assets  assumption for the portfolio.  This resulted
in the  selection  of the  8.25%  expected  long-term  rate of  return on assets
assumption for 2004 and 2003.
     The  assumed  rate of future  increases  in per capita  cost of health care
benefits  (the  health  care cost trend  rate) is 13.0% at  December  31,  2004,
decreasing gradually to 5.0% by the year 2013. A one-percentage-point  change in
the assumed health care cost trend rates would have an immaterial  effect on the
postretirement benefit obligation, as well as on service and interest costs.
     The Pension Plan's weighted average asset allocations at September 30, 2004
and 2003, by asset category are as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
September 30,                                                    2004     2003

Debt securities                                                   37%      34%
Other                                                              1%       6%
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Total                                                         100%     100%
================================================================================

     The goals of the asset  strategy  are to ensure that the  principal  of the
Pension Plan is  preserved  and  enhanced  over the long term,  both in real and
nominal terms,  manage risk exposure,  and exceed the funding requirement over a
market cycle (3 to 5 years).
     Risk is managed by investing in a broad range of asset classes,  and within
those classes, a broad range of individual securities.
     The Pension Plan's Investment  Committee,  which oversees the investment of
Pension Plan assets, utilizes the following target asset allocation and ranges:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                          Low    Target   High

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(1)  Includes real estate equity trusts,  private equity funds,  and hedge funds
     with a 5% target allocation for each.

     Equity securities include shares of common stock of CSC in the amount of $3
million  (1% of total  plan  assets)  at both  September 30,  2004 and 2003.  In
addition,  due to external investment  management of the funds, the Pension Plan
may indirectly  hold  additional  shares of CSC stock.  The aggregate  amount of
these shares would not be considered material relative to the total fund assets.
     U.S. Trust's  funding  policy  is to  make  contributions  consistent  with
Federal  laws  and  regulations.   In  September 2004,   U.S. Trust  contributed
$40 million to the Pension Plan. No contributions are expected to be made to the
Pension Plan during 2005,  while  $2 million is expected to be paid with respect
to postretirement benefits plans in 2005.
     The  following   benefit  payments,   which  reflect  future  service,   as
appropriate, are expected to be paid:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21. Earnings Per Share

     Basic EPS  excludes  dilution and is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS
reflects the potential  reduction in EPS that could occur if securities or other
contracts to issue common stock were  exercised or converted  into common stock.
EPS under the basic and diluted computations are as follows:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                     2004      2003       2002

     The computation of diluted EPS for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003,
and  2002,   respectively,   excludes  outstanding  stock  options  to  purchase
91 million,  107 million,  and  111 million  shares,  respectively,  because the
exercise  prices for those options were greater than the average market price of
the common shares, and therefore the effect would be antidilutive.


22.      Regulatory Requirements

     CSC is a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company
subject to  supervision  and  regulation by the Federal  Reserve Board under the
Bank  Holding  Company  Act of 1956,  as  amended  (the  Act).  The Act  permits
financial  holding  companies  to engage in  activities  that are  financial  in
nature,  including banking,  securities brokerage,  underwriting,  dealing in or
making a market in  securities,  investment  management  services and  insurance

                                     - 52 -


                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
              (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data,
                  Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)


activities. The Federal Reserve Board may impose limitations,  restrictions,  or
prohibitions on the activities or acquisitions of a financial holding company if
the  Federal  Reserve  Board  believes  that  the  company  does  not  have  the
appropriate  financial  and  managerial  resources  to  commence  or  conduct an
activity,  make an acquisition,  or retain  ownership of a company.  The Federal
Reserve Board may also take actions as appropriate to enforce applicable federal
law.
     Federal Reserve Board policy provides that a bank holding company generally
should not pay cash dividends  unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund
the dividends  and the  company's  prospective  retained  earnings  appear to be
sufficient  to meet the capital  needs,  asset  quality  and  overall  financial
condition of the holding company and its depository institution subsidiaries.
     CSC's primary depository  institution  subsidiaries are United States Trust
Company of New York (U.S. Trust NY),  U.S. Trust Company,  National  Association
(U.S. Trust  NA), and Schwab Bank.  The  operations  and financial  condition of
CSC's  depository  institution   subsidiaries  are  subject  to  regulation  and
supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state
law. Among other things, these requirements govern transactions with CSC and its
non-depository institution subsidiaries, including loans and other extensions of
credit, investments or asset purchases,  dividends and investments.  The federal
banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these  regulations,  including the
power to terminate deposit  insurance,  impose substantial fines and other civil
and criminal  penalties and appoint a conservator  or receiver.  CSC,  USTC, and
their  U.S.-based   insured  depository   institution   subsidiaries  must  meet
regulatory capital guidelines adopted by the federal banking agencies. Under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, the banking regulatory agencies are permitted or,
in certain cases, required to take certain substantial  restrictive actions with
respect to  institutions  falling within one of the lowest three of five capital
categories.
     Under the Act,  the  Federal  Reserve  Board has  established  consolidated
capital  requirements  for bank holding  companies.  CSC and USTC are subject to
those  guidelines.  The Act  prohibits  the Federal  Reserve Board from imposing
capital  requirements  on  functionally  regulated  non-depository   institution
subsidiaries  of  a  financial  holding  company,  such  as  broker-dealers  and
investment advisors.
     To  maintain  its  status as a  financial  holding  company,  each of CSC's
depository  institution  subsidiaries must be kept "well  capitalized" and "well
managed." In addition, each of CSC's insured depository institution subsidiaries

(1)  Minimum tier 1 capital,  total capital,  and tier 1 leverage ratios are 4%,
     8%,  and  3%-5%,  respectively,  for  bank  holding  companies  and  banks.
     Additionally,  Schwab Bank is subject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of
     8% for  its  first  three  years  of  operations.  Well-capitalized  tier 1
     capital,  total  capital,  and tier 1 leverage  ratios are 6%, 10%, and 5%,

     Based on their respective  regulatory  capital ratios at December 31,  2004
and 2003, the Company, U.S. Trust, U.S. Trust NY, U.S. Trust NA, and Schwab Bank
are  considered  well  capitalized  (the highest  category)  pursuant to banking
regulatory  guidelines.  There  are no  conditions  or  events  that  management
believes have changed the Company's,  U.S. Trust's,  U.S. Trust NY's, U.S. Trust
NA's, or Schwab Bank's well-capitalized status.
     CSC's  depository  institution  subsidiaries  are  required,  under federal
regulations,  to maintain  reserve balances at the Federal Reserve Bank based on
deposit levels.  These amounts are included in cash and  investments  segregated
and on deposit for federal or other  regulatory  purposes.  The average balances
were $94 million in 2004 and $57 million in 2003.
     Schwab is subject to the  Uniform  Net  Capital  Rule under the  Securities

minimum  net  capital,  as  defined,  of  the greater of 2% of  aggregate  debit
balances arising from client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement, which
is based on the type of business conducted by the broker-dealer. At December 31,
2004, 2% of aggregate debits was $205 million, which exceeded the minimum dollar
requirement for Schwab of $1 million. At December 31, 2004, Schwab's net capital
was $1.2 billion  (12% of aggregate debit  balances),  which was $1.0 billion in
excess of its minimum  required net capital and  $723 million in excess of 5% of
aggregate debit balances.  Under the alternative method, a broker-dealer may not
repay  subordinated  borrowings,  pay  cash  dividends,  or make  any  unsecured
advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net
capital of less than 5% of  aggregate  debit  balances  or less than 120% of its
minimum dollar requirement.
     Schwab  had  portions  of its  cash  and  investments  segregated  for  the
exclusive benefit of clients at December 31, 2004, in accordance with applicable
regulations.

     Guarantees:  The Company  recognizes,  at the  inception of a guarantee,  a
liability for the estimated fair value of the  obligation  undertaken in issuing
the guarantee.  The fair values of the obligations  relating to standby LOCs are
estimated  based on fees charged to enter into similar  agreements,  considering
the  creditworthiness of the counterparties.  The fair values of the obligations
relating to other  guarantees are estimated  based on  transactions  for similar
guarantees or expected  present value  measures.  The Company  provides  certain
indemnifications  (i.e., protection against damage or loss) to counterparties in
connection with the disposition of certain of its assets. Such  indemnifications
typically relate to title to the assets  transferred,  ownership of intellectual
property rights (e.g.,  patents),  accuracy of financial statements,  compliance
with laws and  regulations,  failure to pay, satisfy or discharge any liability,
or to defend claims, as well as errors, omissions, and misrepresentations. These
indemnification  agreements  have  various  expiration  dates and the  Company's
liability  under  these  agreements  is  generally  limited to  certain  maximum
amounts.  At December 31,  2004, the Company's maximum potential liability under
these  indemnification  agreements  is  limited to  approximately  $115 million.
Additionally,  the Company  has  guaranteed  certain  payments in the event of a
termination  of  certain  mutual  fund  sub-advisor  agreements,  related to the
adoption of AXA Rosenberg LLC's U.S. family of mutual funds, known as the Laudus
Funds.  The  maximum  aggregate  guarantee  is  $75 million  through  2011,  and
$50 million  thereafter.  The Company does not believe  that any  material  loss
related  to such  indemnifications  is  likely  and  therefore  the  liabilities
recorded for these guarantees are immaterial.
     In connection with the sale of SSCM, the Company provided  indemnifications
to UBS regarding certain litigation and income tax matters. The Company recorded
a  liability  of  $19 million  reflecting  the  estimated  fair  value  of these
indemnifications.
     LOCs are  conditional  commitments  issued by  U.S. Trust  to guarantee the
performance  of a client  to a third  party.  For  example,  LOCs can be used to
guarantee  performance under

                                     - 54 -


                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
              (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data,
                  Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)


lease and other agreements by professional  business  corporations and for other
purposes.  The credit risk involved in issuing LOCs is  essentially  the same as
that  involved  in  extending  loans.  LOCs  are  generally  partially  or fully
collateralized by cash, marketable equity securities, marketable debt securities
(including  corporate and U.S. Treasury debt  securities),  and other assets. At
December 31, 2004,  U.S. Trust had LOCs  outstanding  totaling $66 million which
are  short-term in nature and generally  expire within one year. At December 31,
2004, the liability recorded for these LOCs is immaterial.
     The Company has clients that sell (i.e.,  write)  listed  option  contracts
that are cleared by various  clearing  houses.  The  clearing  houses  establish
margin  requirements  on these  transactions.  The Company  satisfies the margin
requirements  by  arranging  LOCs,  in favor of the  clearing  houses,  that are
guaranteed by multiple  banks. At  December 31,  2004, the outstanding  value of
these LOCs totaled  $630 million.  In  connection  with its  securities  lending
activities,  Schwab is  required  to provide  collateral  to  certain  brokerage
clients.  Schwab  satisfies the collateral  requirements  by arranging  LOCs, in
favor of these  brokerage  clients,  that are guaranteed by multiple  banks.  At
December 31,  2004, the outstanding value of these LOCs totaled $52 million.  No
funds were drawn  under  these  LOCs at  December 31,  2004.
     The Company also  provides  guarantees to  securities  clearing  houses and
exchanges under their standard membership  agreement,  which requires members to
guarantee the  performance  of other members.  Under the  agreement,  if another
member  becomes  unable to satisfy its  obligations  to the clearing  houses and
exchanges,  other  members would be required to meet  shortfalls.  The Company's
liability under these  arrangements is not  quantifiable and may exceed the cash
and securities it has posted as collateral.  However, the potential  requirement
for  the  Company  to  make  payments  under  these   arrangements   is  remote.
Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these transactions.
     Legal  contingencies:  The  Company and its  affiliates  have been named in
various  legal  proceedings  arising from the conduct of its  business.  Some of
these  legal  actions  include  claims for  substantial  damages or  unspecified
damages.  The  Company  believes  it  has  strong  defenses  and  is  vigorously
contesting  such actions.  The Company is also  involved,  from time to time, in
investigations  and proceedings by regulatory and other  governmental  agencies,
which may result in adverse  judgments,  fines or  penalties.  It is  inherently
difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal and regulatory matters,
particularly  in  cases in  which  claimants  seek  substantial  or  unspecified
damages, and a substantial judgment,  settlement or penalty could be material to
the Company's operating results for a particular future period, depending on the
Company's results for that period. However, based on current information,  it is
the opinion of management,  after consultation with counsel, that the resolution
of these  matters  will not have a  material  adverse  impact  on the  financial
condition, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company.
     As part of the sale of SSCM to UBS, the Company agreed to indemnify UBS for
expenses  associated  with  certain  litigation,  including  multiple  purported
securities class actions against SoundView and certain of its subsidiaries filed
in the United District Court for the Southern  District of New York,  brought on
behalf of persons  who  either  directly  or in the  aftermarket  purchased  IPO
securities  between  March 1997 and  December  2000.  The Company is  vigorously
contesting the claims on behalf of SoundView.


24. Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk or
    Market Risk

     Securities  lending:  Through Schwab,  the Company loans client  securities
temporarily  to  other  brokers  in  connection  with  its  securities   lending
activities.  The Company receives cash as collateral for the securities  loaned.
Increases in security prices may cause the market value of the securities loaned
to  exceed  the  amount  of  cash  received  as  collateral.  In the  event  the
counterparty  to these  transactions  does not return the loaned  securities  or
provide  additional cash  collateral,  the Company may be exposed to the risk of
acquiring the  securities  at  prevailing  market prices in order to satisfy its
client  obligations.  The  Company  mitigates  this  risk  by  requiring  credit
approvals  for  counterparties,  by  monitoring  the market value of  securities
loaned,  and by requiring  additional  cash as collateral  when  necessary.  The
market  value of  Schwab's  client  securities  pledged  in  securities  lending
transactions  to other  broker-dealers  was  $1.2 billion  and  $2.3 billion  at
December 31,   2004  and  2003,  respectively.   Additionally,   Schwab  borrows
securities from other  broker-dealers to fulfill short sales of its clients. The
market value of these borrowed  securities was  $254 million and $229 million at
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     Client trade  settlement:  The Company is obligated to settle  transactions
with brokers and other financial  institutions  even if its clients fail to meet
their  obligations  to the  Company.  Clients are  required  to  complete  their
transactions on settlement date, generally three business days after trade date.
If clients do not fulfill their contractual  obligations,  the Company may incur
losses. The Company has established  procedures to reduce this risk by requiring
deposits from clients in excess of amounts prescribed by regulatory requirements
for certain  types of trades,  and

                                     - 55 -


                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
              (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data,
                  Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)


therefore  the  potential  for  Schwab  to  make  payments  under  these  client
transactions is remote.  Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these
transactions.
     Margin  lending:  Schwab  provides  margin  loans to its clients  which are
collateralized by securities in their brokerage  accounts.  Schwab may be liable
for the margin  requirement  of its client margin  securities  transactions.  As
clients write options or sell securities  short, the Company may incur losses if
the  clients do not  fulfill  their  obligations  and the  collateral  in client
accounts is not  sufficient  to fully cover losses which  clients may incur from
these  strategies.  To mitigate this risk, the Company monitors  required margin
levels and clients  are  required to deposit  additional  collateral,  or reduce
positions, when necessary. Clients with margin loans have agreed to allow Schwab
to pledge  collateralized  securities in their brokerage  accounts in accordance
with federal regulations.  Schwab was allowed, under such regulations, to pledge
securities  with  a  market  value  of   $13.8 billion   and   $12.0 billion  at
December 31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively.  The market value of Schwab's client
securities  pledged to fulfill the short  sales of its clients was  $1.2 billion
and $1.1 billion at December 31,  2004 and 2003, respectively.  The market value
of Schwab's client  securities  pledged to fulfill  Schwab's  proprietary  short
sales  was  $15 million   and   $13 million  at  December 31,   2004  and  2003,
respectively. Schwab has also pledged a portion of its securities owned in order
to fulfill the short sales of clients and in connection with securities  lending
transactions  to  other  broker-dealers.  The  market  value  of  these  pledged
securities  was  $8 million  and  $2 million  at  December 31,  2004  and  2003,
respectively.  The Company may also pledge client  securities to fulfill  client
margin  requirements  for open option  contracts  established  with the OCC. The
market  value  of  these  pledged  securities  to the OCC was  $365 million  and
$424 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.
     Financial  instruments  held for trading  purposes:  The Company  maintains
inventories in securities on a long and short basis relating to its fixed income
operations.  The Company  could incur  losses or gains as a result of changes in
the market value of these securities.  To mitigate the risk of losses,  long and
short  positions  are marked to market and are monitored by management to assure
compliance with limits established by the Company.
     Resale and repurchase agreements:  Schwab enters into collateralized resale
agreements  principally with other broker-dealers,  which could result in losses
in the  event  the  counterparty  to  the  transaction  does  not  purchase  the
securities  held as  collateral  for the cash  advanced  and the market value of
these  securities  declines.  To mitigate  this risk,  Schwab  requires that the
counterparty deliver securities to a custodian, to be held as collateral, with a
market value in excess of the resale price.  Schwab also sets  standards for the
credit quality of the counterparty,  monitors the market value of the underlying
securities as compared to the related  receivable,  including  accrued interest,
and requires  additional  collateral where deemed  appropriate.  At December 31,
2004 and 2003, the market value of collateral received in connection with resale
agreements  that is  available to be  repledged  or sold was  $13.4 billion  and
$17.2 billion,  respectively.  U.S. Trust may enter into  repurchase  agreements
where it sells its fixed income  securities  with an agreement to repurchase the
securities at a future specified date. At December 31,  2004, U.S. Trust did not
have any of these agreements with third parties.
     At both December 31,  2004 and 2003, financial instruments in the amount of
$1.3 billion  were pledged to secure public  deposits,  to qualify for fiduciary
powers and for other purposes or as collateral for  borrowings.  Included in the
above amount at  December 31,  2003, the fair value of collateral  pledged under
repurchase  agreements  that  is  available  to be  repledged  or  sold  by  the
counterparties was $129 million.  At December 31,  2004, there was no collateral
pledged under repurchase agreements that is available to be repledged or sold by
the counterparties.
     Concentration risk: The Company's most significant concentration of risk is
its exposure to securities issued by the U.S.  Government and its agencies (U.S.
Government).   The  Company's  direct  market  risk  exposure,   primarily  from
investments  in securities  available  for sale,  amounted to  $3.2 billion  and
$1.6 billion at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.  The Company maintains
indirect exposure to U.S. Government securities held as collateral to secure its
resale  agreements.  The  Company's  primary  credit  exposure  on these  resale
transactions  is with its  counterparty.  The Company would have exposure to the
U.S.  Government  securities only in the event of the counterparty's  default on
the  resale  agreements.  Securities  issued  by the  U.S.  Government  held  as
collateral  for  resale  agreements  at  December 31,   2004  and  2003  totaled
$13.4 billion and $17.2 billion, respectively.
     Commitments  to extend  credit and LOCs:  In the normal course of business,
U.S. Trust and Schwab Bank enter into various transactions involving off-balance
sheet  financial  instruments  to meet the needs of their  clients and to reduce
their own exposure to interest rate risk. The credit risk  associated with these
instruments varies depending on the creditworthiness of the client and the value
of any collateral held. Collateral requirements vary by type of instrument.  The
contractual  amounts of these  instruments  represent the amounts at risk should
the  contract  be fully  drawn upon,  the client  default,  and the value of any
existing collateral become worthless.
     Credit-related  financial  instruments  include firm  commitments to extend
credit (firm commitments) and LOCs.

Firm  commitments  are  legally  binding  agreements  to lend to a  client  that
generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination  clauses, may require
payment of a fee and are not secured by  collateral  until  funds are  advanced.
Collateral held includes marketable  securities,  real estate mortgages or other
assets.  The  majority  of U.S.  Trust and Schwab  Bank's firm  commitments  are
related to mortgage  lending to banking clients.  Firm commitments  totaled $2.2
billion and $1.6  billion at  December  31,  2004 and 2003,  respectively.  LOCs
outstanding  at  December  31,  2004 and 2003  amounted  to $66  million and $64
million, respectively.
     Interest  rate  swaps:  As part of its  consolidated  asset  and  liability
management process, the Company utilizes Swaps to manage interest rate risk. The
market values of Swaps can vary  depending on movements in interest  rates.  The
amounts at risk upon  default are  generally  limited to the  unrealized  market
value  gains  of  the  Swaps,  if  any.  The  risk  of  default  depends  on the
creditworthiness of the counterparty. The Company evaluates the creditworthiness
of its counterparties as part of its normal credit review procedures.
     U.S. Trust  uses  LIBOR-based   Swaps  to  hedge  the  interest  rate  risk
associated with its variable rate deposits from banking  clients.  The Swaps are
structured for U.S. Trust to receive a variable rate of interest and pay a fixed
rate of interest.  Information  on these Swaps is  summarized  in the  following
table:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
December 31,                                                    2004      2003

Notional principal amount                                     $  625    $  705
Weighted-average variable interest rate                        2.39%     1.17%
Weighted-average fixed interest rate                           4.25%     6.41%
Weighted-average maturity (in years)                             3.3       1.0
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     These Swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133 and
are recorded on the Company's  consolidated balance sheet, with changes in their
fair values primarily recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), a component
of stockholders' equity. At December 31,  2004, U.S. Trust recorded a derivative
asset of $3 million  and a derivative  liability of $9 million  related to these
Swaps.  At  December 31,  2003,  U.S. Trust  recorded a derivative  liability of
$33 million  for these Swaps.  Based on current  interest rate  assumptions  and
assuming no additional Swap agreements are entered into,  U.S. Trust  expects to
reclassify  approximately  $4 million,  or  $3 million  after  tax,  from  other
comprehensive loss to interest expense over the next twelve months.
     CSC uses Swaps to effectively convert the interest rate  characteristics of
a portion  of its  Medium-Term  Notes from fixed to  variable.  These  Swaps are
structured  for CSC to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable  rate
of interest based on the  three-month  LIBOR rate.  The variable  interest rates
reset every  three  months.  Information  on these  Swaps is  summarized  in the
following table:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
December 31,                                                    2004      2003

Weighted-average variable interest rate                        4.85%     3.62%
Weighted-average fixed interest rate                           7.57%     7.57%
Weighted-average maturity (in years)                             4.3       5.3
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     These Swaps have been  designated as fair value hedges under  SFAS No. 133,
and are recorded on the Company's  consolidated  balance sheet.  Changes in fair
value of the Swaps are completely  offset by changes in fair value of the hedged
Medium-Term Notes. Therefore,  there is no effect on net income. At December 31,
2004 and 2003, CSC recorded a derivative  asset of $13 million and  $19 million,
respectively,   for  these  Swaps.  Concurrently,  the  carrying  value  of  the
Medium-Term  Notes was increased by $13 million  and $19 million at December 31,
2004 and 2003, respectively.

================================================================================

Cash  and  cash  equivalents,  cash  and  investments  segregated,  receivables,
deposits from banking clients, payables, accrued expenses and other liabilities,
and short-term  borrowings are short-term in nature and accordingly are recorded
at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value.

Securities  owned are  recorded at  estimated  fair value.  Such fair values are
estimated using quoted market prices,  where available,  or third-party  pricing
services.

Loans to banking  clients:  The fair value of the Company's  loans are estimated
using  discounted   contractual  cash  flows  adjusted  for  current  prepayment
estimates.  The discount  rates used are based on the interest  rates charged to
current clients for comparable loans.

Loans  held for sale:  The fair value of the  Company's  loans held for sale are
estimated using the quoted market prices for securities  backed by similar types
of loans.

Swaps:  The fair value of the Company's Swaps are estimated by obtaining  quotes
from dealers and third-party pricing services.

Long-term debt: A portion of the Company's  long-term debt has been adjusted for
changes in the fair value of Swaps. See note "24 - Financial Instruments Subject
to  Off-Balance  Sheet Risk,  Credit Risk or Market Risk." The fair value of the
Company's  long-term debt is estimated using  third-party  pricing  services and
discounted cash flow analyses utilizing  discount rates currently  available for
similar instruments.

Off-balance sheet financial  instruments:  In the normal course of business, the
Company is a party to certain off-balance sheet financial instruments, primarily
consisting of firm  commitments  and LOCs,  which  represent  obligations of the
Company.  As of  December 31,  2004,  the majority of these  commitments  mature
within one year. The fair value of firm commitments and LOCs are estimated based
on  fees   charged   to  enter  into   similar   agreements,   considering   the
creditworthiness  of the  counterparties.  The Company has reviewed the unfunded
portion of its firm commitments as well as its LOCs and determined that the fair
values of these instruments were immaterial at December 31, 2004 and 2003.


26. Segment Information

     Segments are defined as components of a company in which separate financial
information is evaluated  regularly by the chief  operating  decision  maker, or
decision-making  group,  in deciding how to allocate  resources and in assessing
performance.  The Company structures its segments according to its various types
of clients and the services provided to those clients.  These segments have been
aggregated, based on similarities in economic characteristics, types of clients,
services provided, distribution channels, and regulatory environment, into three
reportable  segments  -  Individual  Investor,   Institutional   Investor,   and
U.S. Trust.  In the third quarter of 2004,  the Company  exited from the capital
markets  business,  and as a result,  the  previously-reported  Capital  Markets
segment has been eliminated.
     The Individual Investor segment includes the Company's retail brokerage and
banking  operations.  The  Institutional  Investor segment  provides  custodial,
trading, and support services to independent investment advisors, serves company
401(k) plan sponsors and third-party administrators,  and supports company stock
option plans. The U.S. Trust  segment provides  investment,  wealth  management,
custody, fiduciary, and private banking services to individual and

                         THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
              (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Per Share Data,
                  Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)


institutional clients.
     The accounting  policies of the segments are the same as those described in
note  "2 -  Significant  Accounting  Policies."  Financial  information  for the
Company's  reportable segments is presented in the following table. In the first
quarter of 2004, the Company  changed its methodology for the computation of its
segment  information.  The new methodology  utilizes an  activity-based  costing
model to  allocate  traditional  income  statement  line  item  expenses  (e.g.,
compensation  and  benefits,  depreciation,  and  professional  services) to the
business activities driving segment expenses (e.g., client service,  opening new
accounts, or business development).  Previously-reported segment information has
been revised to reflect this new methodology. Previously, technology, corporate,
and general administrative  expenses were allocated to the segments generally in
proportion to either their respective  revenues or average full-time  equivalent
employees,  except for the U.S. Trust segment,  for which expenses were directly
incurred.

     The Company  periodically  reallocates  certain revenues and expenses among
the  segments  to align them with the  changes in the  Company's  organizational
structure.  Previously-reported  segment information has been revised to reflect
changes  during the year in the  Company's  internal  organization.  The Company
evaluates the  performance  of its segments based on adjusted  operating  income
before  taxes  (a  non-GAAP  income  measure),  which  excludes  items  such  as
non-operating revenues,  restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition-
and merger-related charges,  discontinued  operations,  and extraordinary items.
Segment  assets  are not  disclosed  because  they are not  used for  evaluating
segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. However,
capital  expenditures  are  used  in  evaluating  segment  performance  and  are
therefore   disclosed.   Intersegment   revenues,   defined  as  revenues   from
transactions  with other segments  within the Company,  are not material and are
therefore not disclosed.  Total revenues,  net interest revenue (i.e.,  interest
revenue,  net of interest  expense),  income from continuing  operations  before
taxes  on  income  and  extraordinary  gain,  and net  income  are  equal to the
Company's  consolidated  amounts  as  reported  in  the  consolidated  financial
statements.  Capital  expenditures  are  reported  gross,  as  opposed to net of
proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.

(3)  In 2004,  includes  restructuring  charges of  $214 million  (see note "3 -
     Restructuring Charges") and a pre-tax gain on an investment of $14 million.
     In 2003,  includes  restructuring  charges of  $76 million  (see  note "3 -
     Restructuring  Charges"), an impairment charge of $5 million (see note "6 -
     Business  Acquisitions and  Divestitures"),  and a pre-tax gain recorded on
     the sale of an investment of $17 million.  In 2002, includes  restructuring
     charges of $343 million (see note "3 - Restructuring Charges"),  impairment
     charges  of   $37 million   (see  note "6  -  Business   Acquisitions   and
     Divestitures"), and acquisition- and merger-related charges of $27 million.

     Fees   received  from  Schwab's   proprietary   mutual  funds   represented
approximately 21% of the Company's  consolidated  revenues in 2004, 23% in 2003,
and 22% in 2002.  Except  for  Schwab's  proprietary  mutual  funds,  which  are
considered a single  client for purposes of this  computation,  no single client
accounted  for more than 10% of the  Company's  consolidated  revenues  in 2004,

     Management   of  The  Charles   Schwab   Corporation,   together  with  its
subsidiaries  (the Company),  is responsible  for  establishing  and maintaining
adequate  internal  control over  financial  reporting.  The Company's  internal
control over financial  reporting is a process designed under the supervision of
the Company's  chief executive  officer and chief  financial  officer to provide
reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the
preparation  of published  financial  statements in accordance  with  accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
     As  of  December 31,  2004,  management  conducted  an  evaluation  of  the

and  procedures  that pertain to the  maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail,  accurately and fairly reflect  transactions and dispositions of assets;

principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts
and  expenditures  are being  made only in  accordance  with  authorizations  of
management and the directors of the Company;  and provide  reasonable  assurance
regarding  prevention or timely  detection of unauthorized  acquisition,  use or
disposition  of the  Company's  assets that could have a material  effect on the
Company's financial statements.
     Management's  assessment  of the  effectiveness  of internal  control  over
financial  reporting  as of  December 31,  2004 has been  audited by  Deloitte &
Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their

     We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Charles
Schwab  Corporation and subsidiaries  (the Company) as of December 31,  2004 and
2003, and the related consolidated  statements of income,  stockholders' equity,
and cash  flows for each of the three  years in the  period  ended  December 31,
2004. Our audits also included the financial  statement  schedule of the Company
on page F-2.  We also have  audited  management's  assessment,  included  in the
accompanying  Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial  Reporting,
that the Company maintained  effective internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31,  2004,  based on criteria  established in Internal  Control -
Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the
Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for these financial
statements and financial statement schedule,  for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial  reporting.  Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  and financial  statement  schedule,  an
opinion on management's  assessment,  and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.
     We  conducted  our audits in  accordance  with the  standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain  reasonable  assurance about whether the
financial  statements are free of material  misstatement  and whether  effective
internal  control  over  financial  reporting  was  maintained  in all  material
respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence  supporting the amounts and  disclosures  in the financial  statements,
assessing the  accounting  principles  used and  significant  estimates  made by
management,  and evaluating the overall financial  statement  presentation.  Our
audit of  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  included  obtaining  an
understanding   of  internal  control  over  financial   reporting,   evaluating
management's  assessment,  testing  and  evaluating  the  design  and  operating
effectiveness  of internal  control,  and performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances.  We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
     A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed
by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the
company's  board of  directors,  management,  and  other  personnel  to  provide
reasonable  assurance  regarding the reliability of financial  reporting and the
preparation  of financial  statements for external  purposes in accordance  with
generally  accepted  accounting  principles.  A company's  internal control over
financial  reporting  includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
the  maintenance  of records that, in reasonable  detail,  accurately and fairly
reflect the  transactions  and  dispositions  of the assets of the company;  (2)
provide  reasonable  assurance  that  transactions  are recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting  principles  and that  receipts and  expenditures  of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of  unauthorized  acquisition,  use, or  disposition  of the company's
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
     Because of the inherent  limitations  of internal  control  over  financial
reporting,  including  the  possibility  of  collusion  or  improper  management
override of controls,  material  misstatements  due to error or fraud may not be
prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also,  projections of any evaluation of
the  effectiveness  of the internal  control over financial  reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate  because
of changes in conditions,  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.
     In our opinion,  the consolidated  financial  statements  referred to above
present fairly, in all material respects,  the financial position of the Company
as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of its operations and its cash
flows for each of the three  years in the period  ended  December 31,  2004,  in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.  Also,  in  our  opinion,  such  financial  statement  schedule,   when
considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a
whole,  presents  fairly,  in all material  respects,  the information set forth
therein.  Also,  in  our  opinion,  management's  assessment  that  the  Company
maintained   effective   internal   control  over  financial   reporting  as  of
December 31,  2004, is fairly  stated,  in all material  respects,  based on the
criteria  established in Internal  Control - Integrated  Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring  Organizations of the Treadway Commission.  Furthermore,
in our opinion,  the Company  maintained,  in all material  respects,  effective
internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,  2004, based on the
criteria  established in Internal  Control - Integrated  Framework issued by the
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.
