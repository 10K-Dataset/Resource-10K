Annual Report On Form 10-K

For Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2006



THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

PART I

Item 1.

Business

General Corporate Overview

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC), headquartered in San Francisco, California, was incorporated in 1986 and
engages, through its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Company, and primarily located in San Francisco except as indicated), in securities brokerage, banking, and related financial services. At December 31, 2006, the Company had
$1.239 trillion in client assets, 6.7 million active brokerage accounts

(a)

, 542,000 corporate retirement plan participants, and 147,000 banking accounts. Certain subsidiaries of CSC include: Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (Schwab), which was incorporated in 1971, is a
securities broker-dealer with 303 domestic branch offices in 45 states, a branch in each of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and London, U.K., and serves clients in Hong Kong through one of CSC’s subsidiaries; Charles Schwab Bank, N.A. (Schwab
Bank), which commenced operations in 2003, is a retail bank located in Reno, Nevada; Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc. (CSIM) is the investment advisor for Schwab’s proprietary mutual funds, which are referred to as the
Schwab Funds

®

; CyberTrader, Inc. (CyberTrader), which was acquired in 2000 and is located in Austin, Texas, is an electronic trading technology and brokerage firm
providing services to highly active, online traders; and The Charles Schwab Trust Company (CSTC), which serves as trustee for employee benefit plans, primarily 401(k) plans.

On November 19, 2006, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Bank of America Corporation (Bank of America) pursuant to
which Bank of America will acquire all of the outstanding stock of U.S. Trust Corporation (USTC, and with its subsidiaries collectively referred to as U.S. Trust), a subsidiary which provides wealth management services and is located in
New York. The transaction is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2007; accordingly, U.S. Trust is presented on a discontinued operations basis for financial statement purposes. All other information contained in this Annual Report
on Form 10-K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted.

In 2004, the Company sold its capital markets business, consisting of the partnership interests of Schwab Capital Markets L.P. and all of the outstanding capital stock of SoundView Technology Group, Inc. (collectively referred to as Schwab
Soundview Capital Markets, or SSCM). In 2003, the Company substantially exited from its international operations with the sales of its U.K. brokerage subsidiary, Charles Schwab Europe, and its investment in Aitken Campbell, a market-making joint
venture in the U.K.

As of December 31, 2006, the Company had full-time,
part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis that represented the equivalent of about 12,400 full-time employees.

The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments – Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional

®

. The Schwab Investor Services segment includes the
Company’s retail brokerage and banking operations, as well as the Schwab Retirement Plan Services division. The Schwab Institutional segment provides custodial, trading and support services to independent investment advisors (IAs). For
financial information by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2006, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 21. Segment Information.”

Business Strategy and Competitive Environment

The Company’s primary strategy is to meet the financial services needs of individual investors and the independent IAs who serve them. In pursuit of this strategy, the Company endeavors to provide clients with a compelling combination
of personalized relationships, superior service, and competitive pricing. The Company also strives to combine people and technology in ways that facilitate the delivery of a full range of investment services at great value. People provide the

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

client focus and personal touch that are essential in serving investors, while technology helps create services that are scalable and consistent. This
combination helps the Company address a wide range of client needs – from tools and information for self-directed investing or active trading, to advice services or wealth management, to retirement plans, to support services for independent IAs
– while enabling each client to easily utilize some or all of these capabilities according to each client’s unique circumstances. In 2006 the Company sharpened its strategic focus with the pending sale of U.S. Trust and the
announcement of an agreement to purchase The 401(k) Company, a provider of retirement plan services.

The Company’s competition in serving individual investors includes a wide range of brokerage, wealth management, and asset management firms. In serving these investors and competing for a growing percentage of
the trillions of dollars of investable wealth in the U.S., the Company offers a multi-channel service delivery model which includes branch, telephonic, and online capabilities. Under this model, the Company can offer personalized service at
competitive prices while giving clients the choice of where, when, and how they do business with the firm. Schwab’s network of branches and regional telephone service centers is staffed with trained and experienced financial consultants (FCs)
focused on building and sustaining client relationships. The Company offers the ability to meet client investing needs through a single ongoing point of contact, even as those needs change over time. In particular, management believes that the
Company’s ability to provide those clients seeking help, guidance, or advice with an integrated, individually tailored solution – ranging from occasional consultations to an ongoing relationship with a Schwab FC or IA – is a
competitive strength versus the more fragmented offerings of other firms.

The
Company’s online and telephonic channels provide quick and efficient access to an extensive array of information, research, tools, trade execution, and administrative services, which clients can access according to their needs. For example, as
clients trade more actively, they can use these channels to access highly competitive pricing, expert tools, and extensive service capabilities – including experienced, knowledgeable teams of trading specialists and integrated product
offerings. Individuals investing for retirement through 401(k) plans can take advantage of the Company’s bundled offering of multiple investment choices, education, and third-party advice. Management also believes the Company is able to compete
with the wide variety of financial services firms striving to attract individual client relationships, by complementing these capabilities with the extensive array of investment, banking, and lending products and services described in the following
section.

In the IA arena, the Company competes with institutional custodians,
traditional and discount brokers, banks, and trust companies. Management believes that its Schwab Institutional segment can maintain its market leadership position primarily through the efforts of its expanded sales and support teams, which are
dedicated to helping IAs grow, compete, and succeed. In addition to focusing on superior service, Schwab Institutional competes by utilizing technology to provide IAs with a highly-developed, scalable platform for administering their clients’
assets easily and efficiently. Schwab Institutional also sponsors a variety of national, regional, and local events designed to help IAs identify and implement better ways to grow and manage their practices efficiently.

Another important aspect of the Company’s ability to compete is its ongoing focus on
efficiency and productivity, as lower costs give the Company greater flexibility in its approach to pricing and investing for growth. Management believes that this flexibility remains important in light of the current competitive environment, in
which a number of competitors have reduced online trading commission rates and account fees. Additionally, the Company’s nationwide marketing effort is an important competitive tool because it reinforces the attributes of the Schwab

®

brand.

Products and Services

The Company offers a broad
range of products to address its clients’ varying investment and financial needs. Examples of these product offerings include:

•

Brokerage – various asset management accounts including some with check-writing features, debit card, and billpay; individual retirement accounts; retirement
plans for small to large businesses; 529 college savings accounts; and margin loans, as well as access to fixed income securities and equity and debt offerings;

•

Banking – first mortgages, home equity lines of credit, pledged-asset mortgages, checking accounts linked to brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit,
demand deposit accounts, and credit cards; and

•

Mutual funds – third-party mutual funds through Mutual Fund Marketplace

®

, including no-load mutual funds through the Mutual Fund OneSource

®

service, proprietary mutual funds from two fund families –
Schwab Funds and Laudus Funds

TM

– and mutual fund trading and clearing services to broker-dealers.

These products, and the Company’s full array of
investing services, are made available through its two segments – Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional.

Schwab Investor Services

Through the Schwab Investor Services segment, the Company provides retail brokerage and banking services to individual investors, as well as 401(k) record keeping and
other retirement plan services to corporations and professional organizations. Clients of the Company, through the Schwab Investor Services segment, have access to the services described below.

The Company offers research, analytic tools, performance reports, market analysis, and
educational material to all clients. Clients looking for more guidance have access to online portfolio planning tools, as well as professional advice from Schwab’s portfolio consultants who can help develop an investment strategy and carry out
investment and portfolio management decisions. Many clients have a relationship with a specific FC, who serves as their primary point of contact for utilizing Schwab’s services.

Schwab strives to demystify investing by educating and assisting clients in the development of investment plans. Educational tools include
workshops, interactive courses, and online information about investing. Additionally, Schwab provides various Internet-based research and analysis tools which are designed to help clients achieve better investment outcomes. As an example of such
tools, Schwab Equity Ratings

®

is a quantitative
model-based stock rating system which provides all clients with ratings on approximately 3,000 stocks, assigning each equity a single grade: A, B, C, D, or F. Stocks are rated based on specific factors relating to fundamentals, valuation, momentum,
and risk and ranked so that the number of ‘buy consideration’ ratings – As and Bs – equals the number of ‘sell consideration’ ratings – Ds and Fs.

Clients may need specific investment recommendations either from time to time or on an ongoing basis. The Company seeks to provide clients
seeking advice with customized solutions. The Company’s approach to advice is based on long-term investment strategies and guidance on portfolio diversification and asset allocation. This approach is designed to be offered consistently across
all of Schwab’s delivery channels.

Schwab Private Client

TM

features a personal advice relationship with a designated
FC, supported by a team of investment professionals who provide individualized service, a customized investment strategy developed in collaboration with the client, and ongoing guidance and execution.

For clients seeking a relationship in
which investment decisions are fully delegated to a financial professional, the Company offers several alternatives. The Company provides investors access to professional investment management in a diversified account that is invested exclusively in
mutual funds through the Schwab Managed Portfolio

TM

program. The Company also refers investors who want to utilize a
specific third-party money manager to direct a portion of their investment assets to the Schwab Managed Account program. In addition, clients who want the assistance of an independent professional in managing their financial affairs may be referred
to IAs in the Schwab Advisor Network

®

. These IAs provide personalized portfolio management, financial planning, and wealth management solutions.

The Company strives to deliver information, education, technology, service, and pricing which
meet the specific needs of clients who trade actively. Schwab offers integrated Web- and software-based trading platforms, which incorporate intelligent order routing technology, real-time market data, options trading, and premium stock research, as
well as multi-channel access. CyberTrader

®

also
offers extensive Web- and software-based trading platforms with more

sophisticated account and trade management features, risk management tools, decision support tools, and dedicated personal support.

The Company serves both foreign investors and non-English-speaking U.S. clients who wish to
trade or invest in U.S. dollar-based securities. The Company has a physical presence in the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. In the U.S., the Company serves Chinese-, Korean-, Spanish-, and Vietnamese-speaking clients through a combination of
designated branch offices and Web-based and telephonic services.

The Company
provides 401(k) recordkeeping and other retirement plan services to corporations and professional organizations through its Schwab Retirement Plan Services division. A dedicated sales force markets these services directly to such organizations, and
the Company also serves plan sponsors indirectly through alliances with third-party administrators. The Company’s bundled

401(k) retirement plan
product offers plan sponsors a wide array of investment options, participant education and servicing, trustee services, and participant-level recordkeeping. Participants in these plans have access to customized advice provided by a third party.

On December 22, 2006, the Company announced an agreement to acquire The
401(k) Company, which offers defined contribution plan services. The 401(k) Company will complement Schwab’s retirement business strategy and increase Schwab’s ability to meet the needs of retirement plans of all sizes. The transaction is
expected to close in March 2007.

Schwab Institutional

Through the Schwab Institutional segment, Schwab provides custodial,
trading, technology, practice management, and other support services to IAs. To attract and serve IAs, Schwab Institutional has a dedicated sales force and service teams assigned to meet their needs.

IAs who custody client accounts at Schwab may use proprietary software that provides them
with up-to-date client account information, as well as trading capabilities. In addition, IAs may utilize the Schwab Institutional website, the core platform for IAs to conduct daily business activities online with Schwab, including submitting
client account information and retrieving news and market information. This platform provides IAs with a comprehensive suite of electronic and paper-based reporting capabilities. Schwab Institutional also offers online cashiering services, as well
as internet-based eDocuments sites for both IAs and their clients that provide multi-year archiving of online statements, trade confirms and tax reports, along with document search capabilities.

To help IAs grow and manage their practices, Schwab Institutional offers a variety of

®

Regulation

CSC is a financial holding company,
which is a type of bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Act). CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries, including Schwab Bank and
affiliates of U.S. Trust (currently reflected as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes), are subject to regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state laws, including
regulatory capital guidelines. Among other things, these requirements govern transactions with CSC and its non-depository institution subsidiaries, including loans and other extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases, dividends, and
investments. The federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver.

To maintain its status as a financial holding company, each of CSC’s
depository institution subsidiaries must be kept “well capitalized” and “well managed.” In addition, each of CSC’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must be rated “satisfactory” or better in meeting the
requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 in order for CSC to engage in new financial activities or enter into certain acquisitions of companies engaged in financial activities.

The securities industry in the United States is subject to extensive regulation under both
federal and state laws. Schwab and CyberTrader are registered as broker-dealers with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the fifty states, and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Schwab and CSIM are registered as investment advisors
with the SEC. Additionally, Schwab is regulated by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with respect to the futures and commodities trading activities it conducts as an introducing broker.

Much of the regulation of broker-dealers has been delegated to self-regulatory organizations
(SROs), namely the national securities exchanges, the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). Schwab is a member of several national securities exchanges and is consequently subject to
their rules and regulations. The primary regulators of Schwab and CyberTrader are the NASD and, for municipal securities, the MSRB. The CFTC has designated the National Futures Association (NFA) as Schwab’s primary regulator for futures and
commodities trading activities. The Company’s business is also subject to oversight by regulatory bodies in other countries in which the Company operates.

The principal purpose of regulating broker-dealers and investment advisors is the protection of clients and the securities markets. The regulations to which
broker-dealers and investment advisors are subject cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales and trading practices, publication of research, margin lending, uses and safekeeping of clients’ funds and
securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, fee arrangements, disclosure to clients, fiduciary duties owed to advisory clients, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees.

As registered broker-dealers, certain subsidiaries of CSC, including Schwab are subject to
SEC Rule 15c3-1 (the Net Capital Rule) and related SRO requirements. The CFTC and NFA also impose net capital requirements. The Net Capital Rule specifies minimum capital requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and
liquidity of broker-dealers. Because CSC itself is not a registered broker-dealer, it is not subject to the Net Capital Rule. However, if Schwab failed to maintain specified levels of net capital, such failure would constitute a default by CSC under
certain debt covenants.

The Net Capital Rule limits broker-dealers’
ability to transfer capital to parent companies and other affiliates. Compliance with the Net Capital Rule could limit Schwab’s operations and its ability to repay subordinated debt to CSC, which in turn could limit CSC’s ability to repay
debt, pay cash dividends, and purchase shares of its outstanding stock.

Item 1A.

Risk Factors

The Company faces a
variety of risks that may affect its operations or financial results, and many of those risks are driven by factors that the Company cannot control or predict. The following discussion addresses those risks that management believes are the most
significant, although there may be other risks that could arise, or may prove to be more significant than expected, that may affect the Company’s operations or financial results.

For a discussion of the Company’s risk management, including technology and operating risk and legal and regulatory risk, see
“Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Risk Management.”

There has been aggressive price competition in the Company’s industry, which may continue in the future.

The Company continually monitors its pricing in relation to competitors and periodically
adjusts commission rates, interest rates, and other fee structures to enhance its competitive position. Increased competition, including pricing pressure, could harm the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

The industry in which the Company competes has undergone a period of consolidation and the
Company now faces stronger competitors.

The Company faces intense
competition for the clients that it serves and the products and services it offers. There has been significant consolidation as financial institutions with which the Company competes have been acquired by or merged into or acquired other firms. This
consolidation may continue. Competition is based on many factors, including the range of products and services offered, pricing, customer service, brand recognition, reputation, and perceived financial strength. Consolidations may enable other firms
to offer a broader range of products and services than the Company does, or offer such products at more competitive prices.

- 6 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

The Company faces intense competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees, especially for employees who
are key to the Company’s ability to build and enhance client relationships.

The market for quality professionals and other personnel in the Company’s business is highly competitive. Competition is particularly strong for financial consultants who build and sustain the Company’s client relationships. The
Company’s ability to continue to compete effectively will depend upon its ability to attract new employees and retain existing employees while managing compensation costs.

Extensive regulation of the Company’s businesses limits the Company’s activities and may subject it to significant penalties.

As a participant in the securities and financial services industries, the
Company is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws by governmental agencies, supervisory authorities, and SROs. Such regulation continues to become more extensive and complex. The requirements imposed by the Company’s
regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect clients. These regulations often serve to limit the Company’s activities by way of net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements, and
restrictions on the businesses in which the Company may operate. Despite the Company’s efforts to comply with applicable regulations, there are a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be unclear or where
regulators revise their previous guidance. Any enforcement actions or other proceedings brought by the Company’s regulators against the Company or its affiliates, officers or employees could result in fines, penalties, cease and desist orders,
enforcement actions, or suspension or expulsion, any of which could harm the Company’s reputation and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

In the ordinary course of business, the Company is subject to litigation and may not
always be successful in defending itself against such claims.

The Company
is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business, which can result in settlements, awards, and injunctions. It is inherently difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters, particularly in cases in which claimants
seek substantial or unspecified damages, and a substantial judgment, settlement, fine, or penalty could be material to the Company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular future period, depending on the Company’s results for
that period.

From time to time, the Company is subject to litigation claims
from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights (e.g., patents). Such litigation can require the expenditure of significant Company resources. If the Company was found to have infringed a third-party patent, or other
intellectual property rights, it could incur substantial liability, and in some circumstances could be enjoined from using certain technology, or providing certain products or services.

Legislation or changes in rules and regulations could negatively impact the Company’s business and financial results.

New legislation, rule changes, or changes in the interpretation or
enforcement of existing federal, state and SRO rules and regulations may directly affect the operation and profitability of the Company or its specific business lines. The profitability of the Company could also be affected by rules and regulations
which impact the business and financial communities generally, including changes to the laws governing taxation, electronic commerce, client privacy and security of client data.

A significant decrease in the Company’s liquidity could negatively affect the Company’s business as well
as reduce client confidence in the Company.

Maintaining adequate
liquidity is crucial to the business operations of the Company, including margin lending, mortgage lending, and transaction settlement, among other liquidity needs. A reduction in the Company’s liquidity position could also reduce client
confidence in the Company, which could result in the loss of client accounts. In addition, if the Company’s broker-dealer or depository institution subsidiaries fail to meet regulatory capital guidelines, regulators could limit the
Company’s operations and its ability to repay debt, pay cash dividends, and repurchase shares of its stock. In particular, any such limitations could have an adverse effect on CSC, which depends primarily on cash generated by its subsidiaries
in order to fulfill its debt service obligations and otherwise meet its liquidity needs. The Company attempts to manage liquidity risk by maintaining sufficient liquid financial resources to fund its balance sheet and meet its obligations. The
Company meets its liquidity needs primarily through cash generated by operations, as well as cash provided by external financing. Fluctuations in client cash or deposit balances, as well as changes in market conditions, may affect the Company’s
ability to meet its liquidity needs.

Specific risk factors which may adversely
affect the Company’s liquidity position include:

•

a reduction in cash held in banking or brokerage client accounts which may affect the amount of the Company’s liquid assets;

•

a significant downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings which could increase its borrowing costs and limit its access to the capital markets; and

•

a dramatic increase in the Company’s client lending activities (including margin, mortgage, and personal lending) which may reduce the Company’s liquid
resources and excess capital position.

Technology and
operational failures could subject the Company to losses, litigation, and regulatory actions.

The Company faces technology and operating risk which is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems of the Company or its vendors that constrain the Company’s ability to
gather, process, and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. This risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, terrorist attacks,
and natural disaster. The Company’s business and operations could be negatively impacted by any significant technology and operational failures. Moreover, instances of fraud or other misconduct, including improper use or disclosure of
confidential client or employee information, might also negatively impact the Company’s reputation and client confidence in the Company, in addition to any direct losses that might result from such instances. Despite the Company’s efforts
to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage risk, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to technology or other operational
failures, including those of its vendors.

The Company also faces risk related
to its security guarantee which covers client losses from unauthorized account activity, such as those caused by external fraud involving the compromise of clients’ login and password information. Losses reimbursed under the guarantee could
have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations.

The
Company relies on outsourced service providers to perform key functions.

The Company relies on service providers to perform certain key technology, processing, and support functions. These service providers also face technology and operating risk and any significant failures by them, including the improper use
or disclosure of the Company’s confidential client or employee information, could cause the Company to incur losses and could harm the Company’s reputation. The Company also faces the risk that a service provider could, without adequate
notice, cease to provide services, which could disrupt the Company’s operations. Switching to an alternative service provider may also require a transition period and result in less efficient operations.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

The Company may suffer significant losses from its credit exposures.

The Company’s businesses are subject to the risk that a client or counterparty will
fail to perform its contractual obligations, or that the value of collateral held to secure obligations will prove to be inadequate. The Company’s exposure mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, its role
as a counterparty in financial contracts, investing activities, banking loan portfolios, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds.

Significant interest rate changes could affect the Company’s profitability and financial condition.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on
its interest-earning assets (such as margin loans and customer mortgages) and its funding sources, such as customer deposits and Company borrowings. Changes in interest rates could affect the interest earned on interest-earning assets differently
than the interest the Company pays on its interest-bearing liabilities. In general, the Company is positioned to benefit from a rising interest rate environment, and could be adversely affected by a general decline in interest rates, although any
potential reduction in net interest income may be offset by growth in the Company’s loan portfolio and inflows of client cash. In addition, in the event prevailing short-term interest rates declined to the point where yields available on money
market mutual funds approached the level of management fees on those funds, the Company could find itself in the position of having to reduce its management fees so that it could continue to pay clients a competitive return on their assets.

Potential strategic transactions could have a negative impact on the
Company’s financial position.

The Company evaluates potential
strategic transactions, including business combinations, acquisitions, and dispositions. Any such transaction could have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The process of evaluating,
negotiating, and effecting any such strategic transaction may divert management’s attention from other business concerns, and might cause the loss of key clients, employees, and business partners. Moreover, integrating businesses and systems
may result in unforeseen expenditures as well as numerous risks and uncertainties, including the need to integrate operational, financial, and management information systems and management controls, integrate relationships with clients and business
partners, and manage facilities and employees in different geographic areas. In addition, an acquisition may cause the Company to assume liabilities or become subject to litigation. Further, the Company may not realize the anticipated benefits from
an acquisition, including the acquisition of The 401(k) Company, and any future acquisition could be dilutive to the Company’s current stockholders’ percentage ownership or to earnings per share (EPS).

The Company’s acquisitions and dispositions are typically subject to closing conditions,
including regulatory approvals and the absence of material adverse changes in the business, operations or financial condition of the entity being acquired or sold. To the extent the Company enters into an agreement to buy or sell an entity,
including the existing agreement to sell U.S. Trust, there can be no guarantee that the transaction will close when expected, or at all. If a material transaction does not close, the Company’s stock price could decline.

The Company’s stock price has fluctuated historically, and may continue to fluctuate.

The Company’s stock price can be volatile. Among the factors that
may affect the Company’s stock price are the following:

•

speculation in the investment community or the press about, or actual changes in, the Company’s competitive position, organizational structure, executive team,
operations, financial condition, financial reporting and results, effectiveness of cost reduction initiatives, or strategic transactions;

•

the announcement of new products, services, acquisitions, or dispositions by the Company or its competitors;

•

increases or decreases in revenue or earnings, changes in earnings estimates by the investment community, and variations between estimated financial results and
actual financial results.

Changes in the stock market
generally or as it concerns the Company’s industry, as well as geopolitical, economic, and business factors unrelated to the Company, may also affect the Company’s stock price.

Developments in the business, economic, and geopolitical environment could negatively impact the Company’s
business.

The Company’s business can be significantly affected by
the general environment – economic, corporate, securities market, regulatory, and geopolitical developments all play a role in client asset valuations, trading activity, interest rates and overall investor engagement. These factors are outside
of the control of the Company and could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial condition.

Legal Proceedings

The Company is
subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business, including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject of inquiries,
investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental agencies. In addition, the Company is responding to certain litigation claims brought against former subsidiaries pursuant to indemnities it has provided to purchasers of those
entities.

The Company believes it has strong defenses in all significant
matters currently pending and is vigorously contesting liability and the damages claimed. Nevertheless, some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards,

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

including penalties, injunctions, or other relief, and the Company may also determine to settle a matter because of
the uncertainty and risks of litigation. Predicting the outcome of a matter is inherently difficult, particularly where claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages, or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage. In many
cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution. However, based on current information and consultation with
counsel, management believes that the resolution of matters currently pending, including those described below, will not have a material adverse impact on the financial condition or cash flows of the Company, but could be material to the
Company’s operating results for a particular future period, depending on results for that period.

SoundView Litigation

: As part of the sale of SoundView to UBS Securities LLC and UBS Americas Inc. (collectively referred to as UBS), the Company agreed to indemnify UBS for certain litigation, including the
claims described below.

SoundView and certain of its subsidiaries are among
the numerous financial institutions named as defendants in multiple purported securities class actions filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the IPO Allocation Litigation) between June and December 2001.
The IPO Allocation Litigation was brought on behalf of persons who either directly or in the aftermarket purchased IPO securities between March 1997 and December 2000. The plaintiffs allege that SoundView entities and the other underwriters named as
defendants required customers receiving allocations of IPO shares to pay excessive and undisclosed commissions on unrelated trades and to purchase shares in the aftermarket at prices higher than the IPO price, in violation of the federal securities
laws. SoundView entities have been named in 31 of the actions, each involving a different company’s IPO, and had underwriting commitments in approximately 90 other IPOs that are the subject of lawsuits. SoundView entities have not been named as
defendants in these cases, although the lead underwriters in those IPOs have asserted that depending on the outcome of the cases, SoundView entities may have indemnification or contribution obligations based on underwriting commitments in the IPOs.
The parties, with the assent of the District Court, selected 17 cases as focus cases for the purpose of case-specific discovery, and in October 2004, the District Court allowed 6 of the focus cases to proceed as class actions. Defendants appealed
that decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which issued an order on December 5, 2006 reversing the District Court and rejecting the consideration of these cases as class actions. Plaintiffs are now appealing
that decision. The Company will continue to vigorously contest these claims on behalf of SoundView pursuant to the indemnity with UBS.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

OVERVIEW

Management of the Company focuses
on several key financial and non-financial metrics in evaluating the Company’s financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless
otherwise noted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 are shown in the following table:

•

Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the
Company’s products and services appeal to new and existing clients.

•

Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Company’s appeal in the marketplace.
Additionally, growth in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues.

•

Daily average revenue trades (DART) is an important indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues.

•

Management believes that net revenue growth, pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders’ equity provide broad indicators of the Company’s
overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns.

•

Net revenue per average full-time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Company’s broadest measure of productivity.

The Company’s net revenues are classified into asset-based and other (i.e., asset
management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue) and trading categories. The Company generates asset-based and other revenues primarily through asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and
third-party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee-based investment management and advisory services, and interest revenue earned on margin loans, loans to banking clients, and investments. Asset-based and other revenues are impacted by securities
valuations, interest rates, the Company’s ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from
trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

During 2006, interest rates stabilized and the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index marked their fourth
consecutive year of gains. Overall market returns for the year showed double-digit gains for the three major indices – the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 16%, the Standard and Poor’s 500 Index increased 14%, and the Nasdaq
Composite Index increased 10%. Coupled with the strong market returns in 2006, the Company experienced a general improvement in client asset flows and trading volume as the year progressed.

The Company strengthened its operating and financial performance in 2006 by focusing on
significantly improving the client experience in each of its two segments. Additionally, reflecting a commitment to deliver a value proposition that includes high quality products and services at competitive prices, the Company reduced its
commission pricing for a wide range of clients and eliminated certain fees in 2006. Assets in client accounts were $1.239 trillion at December 31, 2006, up 18% from 2005. Net new client assets in the Schwab Investor Services and Schwab
Institutional segments totaled $87.3 billion for the year, up 33% from a year ago.

Overall, the Company’s success in attracting client assets and building stronger client relationships, as well as the interest rate environment and improved market performance, led to a 24% increase in asset-based and other revenues
and total net revenue growth of 19%. Expenses increased by 9% over 2005 levels, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, professional services expense, and advertising and market development expense. The Company achieved an
increase in its pre-tax profit margin from continuing operations due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth in 2006. Return on stockholders’ equity grew in 2006 due to both a 69% increase in net income to $1.2 billion (the highest
level in the Company’s history) and its capital management activities, including the repurchase of $859 million of common stock.

Discontinued Operations

On November 19, 2006, CSC entered into a definitive agreement with Bank of America pursuant to which Bank of America will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion in
cash. The transaction is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2007. However, the closing is subject to (i) approval of new investment advisor agreements for each of the Excelsior

®

mutual funds by the applicable public fund board and the stockholders of each fund,
(ii) regulatory approvals, and (iii) other customary closing conditions. The Company estimates it will record a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.9 billion. After-tax proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes,
including share repurchases and continued investment in Schwab Investor Services, Schwab Institutional, and Schwab Bank. U.S. Trust comprised all of the previously-reported U.S. Trust segment.

In 2006, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $205 million related to the
estimated difference between the tax and book bases of the Company’s U.S. Trust stock. This amount is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. When calculating the
Company’s gain on the sale of U.S. Trust for income tax purposes, the tax basis will be the basis of U.S. Trust’s prior stockholders in their shares as of the date U.S. Trust was acquired by the Company, since the
transaction qualified as a tax-free exchange. This tax benefit is management’s current estimate and is based on publicly available information, including information on the composition of U.S. Trust’s stockholders at the acquisition
date and the market price of U.S. Trust stock during relevant periods. The final amount of the basis difference, which could differ from management’s estimate, will be determined following a survey of former U.S. Trust stockholders that
the Company expects to complete in mid-2007.

The results of operations, net of
income taxes, and cash flows of U.S. Trust have been presented as discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income and of cash flows, respectively, and the assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust have been
combined and presented as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s consolidated prior period revenues, expenses, taxes on income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows also
reflect this presentation.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

On October 29, 2004, the Company sold its capital markets business to UBS and thereby eliminated the revenues
and expenses unique to the capital markets business. The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of the capital markets business have been presented as discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of
income and of cash flows for all periods.

Subsequent Events

On January 24, 2007, Christopher V. Dodds, Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer of CSC, announced his decision to retire as the Chief Financial Officer of CSC on May 18, 2007. The Board of Directors named Joseph R. Martinetto, Senior Vice President and Treasurer of CSC and Schwab, to replace
Mr. Dodds as Chief Financial Officer of CSC effective upon Mr. Dodds’ retirement on May 18, 2007.

On February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors appointed Walter W. Bettinger II as President and Chief Operating Officer of CSC. Mr. Bettinger had been serving as
Executive Vice President and President-Schwab Investor Services.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

n/m Not meaningful.

The increase in asset-based and other revenues from 2005 was primarily due to an increase in
asset management and administration fees resulting from higher levels of client assets and an increase in net interest revenue resulting from yields on assets increasing faster than those on liabilities. The increase in trading revenues from 2005
was primarily due to higher client trading activity, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade resulting from reductions in the Company’s commission pricing, which were effective in the third quarter of 2006.

- 17 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

The increase in expenses excluding interest from 2005 was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense,
professional services expense, and advertising and market development expense. The increases in the effective income tax rates from 2004 to 2006 were primarily due to higher state taxes.

The increase in income from continuing operations before taxes on income from 2005 was primarily due to higher asset-based and other
revenues. The higher income from continuing operations, combined with the income from discontinued operations, resulted in a 69% increase in net income.

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation. All references to EPS information in this Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.

Segment Information

The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis excluding items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items.

As detailed in “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements – 21. Segment Information,” income from continuing operations before taxes on income was $1.5 billion for 2006, up $449 million, or 44%, from 2005 primarily due to increases of
$278 million, or 37%, in the Schwab Investor Services segment; $87 million, or 27%, in the Schwab Institutional segment; and an $84 million increase in unallocated and other income from continuing operations. The increases in the
Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments were primarily due to growth in net interest revenue and higher asset management and administrative fees combined with expense growth that was lower than revenue growth. The increase in
unallocated and other income from continuing operations was primarily due to the receipt of $25 million related to the confidential resolution of a legal matter in 2006 and restructuring charges recorded in 2005.

Net Revenues

The Company categorizes its revenues as either asset-based and other revenues or trading revenue. As shown in the following table,
asset-based and other revenues, trading revenue, and total net revenues increased from 2005.

- 19 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments generate both asset-based and other revenues and trading
revenues. Net revenues by segment are as shown in the following table:

The increase in net revenues in both
the Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments was primarily due to higher levels of client assets and higher interest rate spreads. The increase in unallocated and other income from continuing operations was primarily due to the
receipt of $25 million related to the confidential resolution of a legal matter in 2006.

Asset Management and Administration Fees

Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees, as well as fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. The Company earns mutual fund
service fees for transfer agent services, shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds. These fees are based upon the
daily balances of client assets invested in third-party funds and upon the average daily net assets of the Company’s proprietary funds. The Company also earns asset management and administration fees for financial services provided to
individual and institutional clients, including trust and custody services.

The increase in asset management and related service fees from 2004 to 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of client assets in the Company’s proprietary mutual funds and higher volumes of asset-based fees from certain client
relationships, including increases in average assets in Schwab’s Mutual Fund OneSource service.

Net Interest Revenue

Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on certain assets (mainly margin loans to clients, investments of segregated client cash balances, loans to banking clients, and securities available for sale) and interest paid
on supporting liabilities (mainly deposits from banking clients and brokerage client cash balances). Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and
portfolio management strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall
(i.e., interest-earning assets reprice more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities). In the event of falling interest rates, the Company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending maturities of assets in investment
portfolios to lock-in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest-bearing liabilities.

In clearing its clients’ trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment,
and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Margin loans arise when Schwab lends funds to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are
generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients.

When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to U.S. government securities, participation certificates, mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by the
Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements

collateralized by qualified securities. Schwab’s policies for credit quality and maximum maturity requirements
are more restrictive than these SEC regulations. Schwab Bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to clients. Schwab Bank invests in securities available for sale,
including commercial paper, collateralized mortgage obligations, corporate debt, and U.S. government securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans. These loans are largely funded by interest-bearing
deposits from banking clients.

The Company’s interest-earning assets are
financed primarily by interest-bearing brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Other funding sources include noninterest-bearing brokerage client cash balances, proceeds from stock-lending activities, and long-term debt, as
well as stockholders’ equity. Client-related daily average balances, interest rates, and average net interest spread are summarized as follows:

(1)

Includes assets and liabilities retained from discontinued operations as discussed below.

The increases in net interest revenue in the last two years
were primarily due to changes in the composition of interest-earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale, loans to banking clients, and margin loan balances, as well as generally higher yields on earning assets, partially
offset by higher interest rates on banking deposits.

- 21 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

Since the Company establishes the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the
rates charged on margin loans, it manages a substantial portion of its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. The Company’s average net interest spread
increased from 2004 to 2006 as the average yield on interest-earning assets, primarily client-related investments, increased more than the average interest rate on funding sources.

Certain interest-bearing assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust to be retained by the Company:

The excess cash held in certain
Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at U.S. Trust. In 2007, Schwab will terminate this arrangement prior to the closing of the sale of U.S. Trust and move these balances to a similar existing
arrangement with Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, these balances totaled $749 million and $711 million, respectively, and are included in deposits from banking clients with a corresponding amount in assets retained from
discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The interest expense related to these client deposit balances is included in interest expense from continuing operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of
income of $11 million, $6 million, and $2 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The corresponding interest revenue on the invested cash balances related to these deposits is included in interest revenue from continuing
operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income of $38 million, $22 million, and $6 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The interest revenue amount is calculated using the Company’s funds transfer
pricing methodology.

Other Revenue

Other revenue generally includes net gains and losses on certain investments, service fees,
and software maintenance fees.

Trading Revenue

Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenues
are affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence
principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades, market price volatility, and changes in regulations and industry practices. The increase in trading revenue from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher daily average revenue
trades, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade as a result of reductions in commission pricing in 2006 and 2005. The decrease in trading revenue from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to lower average revenue earned per
revenue trade as a result of reductions in commission pricing for a wide range of clients in 2005 and 2004, partially offset by higher daily average revenue trades.

As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades executed by the Company increased 18% in 2006. Average revenue earned per
revenue trade decreased 14% from 2005 to 2006, and 41% from 2004 to 2005, primarily due to the pricing changes discussed above.

Expenses Excluding Interest

As shown in the table below, total expenses excluding interest increased in 2006 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense,
professional services expense, and advertising and market development expense.

Compensation and Benefits

Compensation and
benefits expense includes salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and related employee benefits and taxes. Incentive compensation is tied to the achievement of specified objectives, including revenue growth, profit margin, and EPS. Therefore, a
significant portion of compensation and benefits expense will fluctuate with these measures.

The increase in compensation and benefits expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of incentive compensation. The decrease in compensation and benefits expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due
to a reduction in full-time employees through the Company’s past restructuring initiatives, partially offset by higher levels of incentives to employees as a result of the Company’s improved financial performance. The following table shows
a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data:

(1)

Includes incentives, discretionary bonus costs, long-term incentive plan compensation, and stock-based
compensation.

(2)

Includes full-time, part-time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, but
excludes professional services related to outsourced service providers. Amounts have been adjusted to exclude U.S. Trust in light of its pending sale.

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

The increases in incentive compensation expense from 2004 to 2006 were primarily due to higher levels of
discretionary bonuses to employees and long-term incentive plan compensation in 2005, and increases in incentives and long-term incentive plan compensation in 2006.

Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits

The increase in professional services expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher levels of fees paid to outsourced service
providers and consultants. The decrease in occupancy and equipment expense from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due to the Company’s past restructuring initiatives and other expense reduction measures. The increase in advertising and market
development expense from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to the Company’s media spending related to its “Talk to Chuck™” national advertising campaign during 2006. The decrease in communications from 2004 to 2005 was primarily due
to decreases in telecommunication services, news and quotes services, and market data fees.

Restructuring

During 2001 to
2004, the Company carried out a series of restructuring initiatives which were designed to strengthen its productivity and efficiency and increase profitability. These initiatives included workforce reductions, reductions in operating facilities,
the removal of certain systems hardware, software, and equipment from service, and the withdrawal from certain international operations. The Company completed its 2004 cost reduction effort in the first half of 2005.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CSC
conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries. The capital structure among CSC and its subsidiaries is designed to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory
requirements.

CSC is a financial holding company, which is a type of bank
holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. In July 2006, USTC (currently reflected as a discontinued
operation for financial statement purposes) became a financial holding company. CSC and its depository institution subsidiaries, which include Schwab Bank and U.S. Trust, are subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s risk-based and leverage
capital guidelines. These regulations require banks and bank holding companies to maintain minimum levels of capital. In addition, CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries are subject to limitations on the amount of dividends they can pay to
CSC. Based on their respective regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s depository institution subsidiaries are considered well capitalized.

Liquidity

CSC

CSC’s liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. Schwab and Schwab Bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict
them from certain transactions with CSC. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSC’s subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSC’s liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet
Schwab Bank’s capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwab’s net capital.

CSC has liquidity needs that arise from its Senior Medium-Term Notes, Series A (Medium-Term Notes), as well as from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and other investments. The Medium-Term Notes, of which $262 million was

issued and outstanding at December 31, 2006, have maturities ranging from 2007 to 2010 and fixed interest rates
ranging from 6.52% to 8.05% with interest payable semiannually. The Medium-Term Notes are rated A2 by Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s), A- by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group (S&P), and A by Fitch IBCA, Inc. (Fitch).

CSC has a prospectus supplement on file with the SEC enabling CSC to issue up
to $750 million in Senior or Senior Subordinated Medium-Term Notes, Series A. At December 31, 2006, all of these notes remained unissued.

CSC has a Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form S-3 on file with the SEC relating to a universal shelf registration for the issuance of up to
$1.0 billion aggregate amount of various securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants. At December 31, 2006, all of these securities remained unissued.

CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue commercial paper up to the amount
of CSC’s committed, unsecured credit facility (see below), not to exceed $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2006, no commercial paper had been issued. CSC’s ratings for these short-term borrowings are P-1 by Moody’s, A-2 by
S&P, and F1 by Fitch.

CSC maintains an $800 million committed,
unsecured credit facility with a group of eighteen banks which is scheduled to expire in June 2007. CSC plans to establish a similar facility to replace this one when it expires. These facilities were unused in 2006. Any issuances under CSC’s
commercial paper program will reduce the amount available under this facility. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes and CSC pays a commitment fee on the unused balance of this facility. The financial covenants
in this facility require CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders’ equity, Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, and CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries to be well capitalized, as defined. Management
believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements.

CSC also has direct access to $792 million of the $842 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines, provided by eight banks, that are primarily utilized by
Schwab to manage short-term liquidity. The amount available to CSC under these lines is lower than the amount available to Schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to Schwab. These lines were not used by CSC in
2006.

Schwab

Most of Schwab’s assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of
short-term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment-grade, interest-earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables
from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current
open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days.

Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $19.9 billion, $24.2 billion, and
$27.0 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab in the future.

The Company has a lease financing liability related to an office building and land under a
20-year lease. The remaining lease financing liability of $126 million at December 31, 2006 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term.

To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of eight banks totaling
$842 million at December 31, 2006. The need for short-term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

between cash flow requirements and the scheduled liquidation of interest-bearing investments. Schwab used such
borrowings for twelve days in 2006, with daily amounts borrowed averaging $79 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2006.

To satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured letter of
credit agreements with eleven banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $930 million at December 31, 2006. Schwab pays a fee to maintain these arrangements. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide
collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging letters of credit (LOCs), in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate face
amount of these outstanding LOCs totaled $173 million. No funds were drawn under these LOCs at December 31, 2006.

Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. These regulations prohibit
Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of
its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2006, Schwab’s net capital was $1.1 billion (10% of aggregate debit balances), which was $850 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $511 million
in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Schwab targets net capital to be at least 10% of its aggregate debit balances, which primarily consist of client margin loans.

To manage Schwab’s regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility
which is scheduled to expire in March 2008. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2006 was $220 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab.

Schwab Bank

Schwab Bank’s current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital.

The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market
deposit account at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2006, these balances totaled $9.9 billion.

Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short-term credit facility
maturing in December 2007. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2006.

Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB). At December 31, 2006, $683 million was
available, and no funds were drawn under this facility.

U.S. Trust
(currently reflected as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes)

The liquidity needs of U.S. Trust are generally met through deposits from banking clients, equity capital, and borrowings.

The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at U.S. Trust. At December 31, 2006, these
balances totaled $749 million.

In addition to traditional funding sources
such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements, USTC’s depository institution subsidiaries have established their own external funding sources. At December 31, 2006, U.S. Trust had $52 million in Trust
Preferred Capital Securities outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 8.41%. In

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

December 2006, U.S. Trust elected to and submitted notice to redeem all of the outstanding Trust Preferred
Capital Securities on February 1, 2007.

Certain of USTC’s depository
institution subsidiaries have established credit facilities with the FHLB totaling $2.3 billion. At December 31, 2006, $100 million was outstanding under these facilities. Additionally, at December 31, 2006, U.S. Trust had
$1 million of federal funds purchased.

U.S. Trust also engages in
intercompany repurchase agreements with Schwab and had $200 million outstanding with Schwab at December 31, 2006.

CSC provides U.S. Trust with a $300 million short-term credit facility maturing in December 2007. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory
capital for U.S. Trust. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2006.

U.S. Trust uses interest rate swap agreements (Swaps) with third parties to hedge the interest rate risk primarily associated with its variable rate deposits from banking clients. These Swaps are structured for
U.S. Trust to receive a variable rate of interest and pay a fixed rate of interest. At December 31, 2006, the Swaps had a notional value of $660 million and a fair value of $6 million.

Prior to or as of the closing date of the sale of U.S. Trust, all of the arrangements
with U.S. Trust disclosed above, except for the credit facilities with the FHLB and the Swaps, will be cancelled or terminated.

Capital Resources

The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Company’s use of capital and currently targets a long-term debt to total
financial capital ratio of less than 20%. The Company’s total financial capital (long-term debt plus stockholders’ equity) at December 31, 2006 was $5.4 billion, up $484 million from December 31, 2005. At
December 31, 2006, the Company had long-term debt of $388 million, or 7% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted-average rate of 7.02%. At December 31, 2005, the Company had long-term debt of $462 million,
or 9% of total financial capital.

The Company’s cash position (reported
as cash and cash equivalents on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under federal or other regulatory
guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with
applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Company’s cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity,
brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long-term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases of CSC’s common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash
equivalents during specific time periods.

In 2006, cash and cash equivalents
increased $2.6 billion, or 137%, to $4.5 billion primarily due to movements of brokerage client-related funds to meet segregation requirements and an increase in deposits from banking clients. These changes were partially offset by a
decrease in payables to brokerage clients and an increase in securities available for sale.

The Company repaid $68 million and $56 million of long-term debt in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Capital Expenditures

In 2006, the Company’s capital expenditures were $122 million. The Company sold $63 million of fixed assets, which primarily consisted of a data center.
In 2005, the Company’s capital expenditures were $98 million and the Company sold $20 million of fixed assets. Capital expenditures, net, as a percentage of net revenues totaled 1% and 2% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2006 and 2005,
capital expenditures were primarily for software and equipment relating to the Company’s information technology systems. Capital expenditures include capitalized costs for developing internal-use software of $42 million in 2006 and
$32 million in 2005.

Management currently anticipates that 2007 capital
expenditures will be approximately 40% higher than 2006 spending, primarily due to increased spending on capitalized costs for developing internal-use software and assets relating to the Company’s information technology systems. As has been the
case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital
expenditures.

Dividends

CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $173 million and $116 million in 2006 and
2005, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 71 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the dividend 18 times, including a 20% and 67% increase in the second and fourth quarters of 2006, respectively. Since 1989,
dividends have increased by a 28% compounded annual growth rate. CSC paid common stock dividends of $.135, $.089, and $.074 per share in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the
Board, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income.

Share Repurchases

CSC repurchased 52 million shares of its common stock for $859 million in 2006 and 56 million shares of its common stock for $688 million in 2005. As of December 31, 2006, CSC had authority to
repurchase up to $87 million of its common stock under prior authorization by the Board of Directors. On January 24, 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $500 million of CSC’s common stock in addition
to this remaining authorization.

Acquisition and Divestiture

Upon completion of the pending sale of U.S. Trust in 2007, the
Company will receive pre-tax proceeds of approximately $3.3 billion. The Company plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and continued investment in Schwab Investor Services, Schwab
Institutional, and Schwab Bank.

On December 22, 2006, the Company
announced an agreement to acquire The 401(k) Company from Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. for $115 million in cash. The transaction is expected to close in March 2007, subject to customary closing conditions.

Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements

The Company enters into various off-balance-sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of
business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of
business. For information on each of these arrangements, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 18. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities.”

RISK MANAGEMENT

Overview

The Company’s business activities expose it to a variety of risks including
technology and operations risk, credit, market and liquidity risks, and legal and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company.

Senior management takes an active role in the Company’s risk management process and has
developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which is
comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Company’s risk exposures, and leading the continued development of the Company’s risk
management policies and practices.

Functional risk sub-committees focusing on
specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub-committees include:

•

Corporate Asset-Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Company’s liquidity, capital resources, and interest rate risk;

•

Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to
banking clients), the investing activities of certain of the Company’s

- 29 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g., counterparty and corporate investing activities), and market risk resulting from the Company taking
positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity;

•

Technology and Operations Risk Committee, which focuses on the integrity of controls and operating capacity of the Company’s systems and operations processes;

•

Fiduciary Risk Committee, which oversees activities of the Company with a fiduciary component;

•

New Products Committee, which addresses risks associated with new products and services; and

•

Information Security and Privacy Steering Committee, which oversees information security and privacy programs and policies.

The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors
(Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures.

The Company’s Disclosure Committee is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s (a) disclosure controls and
procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the
Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

Additionally, the Company’s compliance,
finance, internal audit, legal, and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Company’s risk management.

Risk is inherent in the Company’s business. Consequently, despite the Company’s
efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage risk, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks.
The following discussion highlights the Company’s policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations.

Technology and Operating Risk

Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Company’s ability to
gather, process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Company’s operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Company’s success
depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety
of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third-party systems, and power failures), the Company’s business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted.
Additionally, rapid increases in client demand may strain the Company’s ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve
the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and
regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms.

Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, terrorist attack, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or
Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or
Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase.

- 30 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk
self-assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster
recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data.

Despite the Company’s risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and
the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate
vulnerabilities or other exposures.

The Company also faces technology and
operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to such outsourcing risks through
contractual agreements, enhanced controls, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information,
employee information, or non-public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Company’s expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to
data security.

The Company is actively engaged in the research and development
of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a client or counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligations, or the value of
collateral held to secure obligations proving to be inadequate. The Company’s direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and
investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the Company’s proprietary funds. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing
credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. In addition, most of the Company’s credit extensions, such as margin loans to clients, securities lending
agreements, and resale agreements, are supported by collateral arrangements. These arrangements are subject to requirements to provide additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral
received.

Additionally, the Company has exposure to credit risk associated
with the Company’s banking loan portfolios held at Schwab Bank and U.S. Trust (currently reflected as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes). This client credit exposure is actively managed through individual and
portfolio reviews performed by account officers and senior line management. Periodic assessment of the validity of credit ratings, credit quality and the credit management process is conducted by a credit review department which is separate from the
loan origination and monitoring department. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, non-performing loans to banking clients, losses, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate
allowance for credit losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management.

Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial
institutions even if Schwab’s client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

Fiduciary Risk

Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to,
individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in
compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing
review of applicable policies by business units and various fiduciary risk committees.

Legal and Regulatory Risk

The Company faces significant legal
and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client
investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Company’s controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a
variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In
addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex.

The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures
reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and
communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti-money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Company’s efforts to maintain an effective compliance program
and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Company’s business activities.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The
consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Company’s revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on
estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Company’s financial
position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for reasonableness and
adequacy.

Income Tax Benefit Related to the Pending Sale of
U.S. Trust:

In 2006, the Company recorded a $205 million income tax benefit related to the estimated difference between the tax and book bases of the Company’s U.S. Trust stock. This amount is included in income from
discontinued operations, net of tax on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. When calculating the Company’s gain on the sale of U.S. Trust for income tax purposes, the tax basis will be the basis of U.S. Trust’s
prior stockholders in their shares as of the date U.S. Trust was acquired by the Company, since the transaction qualified as a tax-free exchange. This tax benefit is management’s current estimate and is based on publicly available
information, including information on the composition of U.S. Trust’s stockholders at the acquisition date and the market price of U.S. Trust stock during relevant periods. The final amount of the basis difference, which could differ from
management’s estimate, will be determined following a survey of former U.S. Trust stockholders that the Company expects to complete in mid-2007.

Valuation of Goodwill

: Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this
excess.

The Company has elected April 1 as its annual goodwill impairment
testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2006, management estimated the fair value of each of the Company’s reporting units (generally defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial
information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value, and therefore management
concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each
reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Company’s planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments
could result in an impairment of the Company’s recorded goodwill. The Company’s goodwill balance, net of accumulated amortization, was $419 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities:

As part of its asset and liability
management process, the Company has entered into Swaps that effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion of the Company’s Medium-Term Notes from fixed to variable. The Company has designated such Swaps as fair value
hedges, as allowed by SFAS No. 133 – Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Since the notional amount, fixed interest rate, and maturity of these Swaps exactly match the terms of the corresponding Medium-Term
Notes, the Company has concluded that these Swaps are completely effective in achieving the desired hedging results, as permitted under SFAS No. 133. Consequently, changes in the fair value of these Swaps, totaling an aggregate of
approximately $500,000 and $2 million asset at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, are completely offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged Medium-Term Notes. Accordingly, there has not been any impact on earnings as a result
of this hedging program except for the conversion from a fixed to a floating rate of interest on a portion of the Medium-Term Notes.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted)

Schwab Bank’s loans held for sale portfolio consists of fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages, which are subject
to a loss in value when market interest rates rise. Schwab Bank uses forward sale commitments to manage this risk. These forward sale commitments have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments of the loans held for sale. Accordingly, the fair
values of these forward sale commitments are recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).

Additionally, Schwab Bank uses forward sale commitments to hedge interest rate lock commitments issued on mortgage loans that will be held
for sale. Schwab Bank considers the fair value of these commitments to be zero at the commitment date, with subsequent changes in fair value determined solely based on changes in market interest rates. Any changes in fair value of the interest rate
lock commitments are completely offset by changes in fair value of the related forward sale commitments.

At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, the derivative assets and liabilities recorded by Schwab Bank for these forward sale and interest rate lock commitments were immaterial.

Allowance for Credit Losses:

The Company regularly evaluates its portfolio of loans to
banking clients and provides allowances for the portion management believes may be uncollectible. Several factors are taken into consideration in this evaluation including current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, past loss
experience, and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. For Schwab Bank’s portfolio, which primarily consists of mortgage loans, a risk-based methodology is used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans are categorized into
portfolios by loan type and risk characteristics. A probable loss rate, based on company and industry experience, is used to determine the credit allowance. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s allowance for credit losses was
$4 million and $3 million on loan portfolios of $2.3 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

Legal Reserve

: Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other
factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action
lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information
becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved.

Stock-based compensation:

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in
accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R – Share-Based Payment. Under the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value
of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of the
Company’s common stock, and expected dividends. Significant changes in these assumptions for future awards could materially impact stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations. In addition, judgment is also
required in estimating the amount of stock-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and the Company’s results of operations could be impacted.

Long-term incentive compensation:

Eligible officers may receive cash
long-term incentive plan units under a long-term incentive plan (LTIP). These awards are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest over a three- to four-year period. Each award provides for a one-time cash payment for an amount that varies
based upon the Company’s cumulative EPS over the respective performance period of each grant. The Company accrues the estimated total cost for each grant on a straight-line basis over each LTIP’s vesting period, with periodic cumulative
adjustments to expense as estimates of the total grant cost are revised. The estimated total cost of each grant will vary based upon changes in

estimated and actual cumulative EPS amounts over each LTIP’s performance period. Grants were issued under this LTIP in 2003, 2004, and 2005 with
performance periods ending December 31, 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. The LTIP liability including discontinued operations was $140 million and $61 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The LTIP expense
including discontinued operations was $78 million, $37 million, and $15 million for the years 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

The Company’s management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has
reviewed with the Audit Committee the Company’s significant estimates discussed in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Item 7A.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market risk is the potential for loss due to a change in the value of a financial instrument held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices, or currency exchange rates.

The Company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily from changes in the interest rates on
its interest-earning assets (mainly margin loans to clients, investments, loans to banking clients, mortgage-backed securities, and other fixed-rate investments) and its funding sources (including brokerage client cash balances, banking deposits,
proceeds from stock-lending activities, and long-term debt) which finance these assets. To mitigate the risk of loss, the Company has established policies and procedures which include setting guidelines on the amount of net interest revenue at risk,
and by monitoring the net interest margin and average maturity of its interest-earning assets and funding sources. The Company also has the ability to adjust the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and
the rates charged on margin loans. The Company’s exposure to equity price and currency exchange risks is not material.

Financial Instruments Held For Trading Purposes

The Company holds fixed income securities, which include municipal and government securities, and corporate bonds, in inventory to meet clients’ trading needs. The
fair value of such inventory was approximately $76 million and $74 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. These securities, and the associated interest rate risk, are not material to the Company’s financial
position, results of operations, or cash flows.

Financial Instruments Held
For Purposes Other Than Trading

Debt Issuances

At December 31, 2006, CSC had $262 million aggregate principal amount of
Medium-Term Notes outstanding, with fixed interest rates ranging from 6.52% to 8.05%. At December 31, 2005, CSC had $330 million aggregate principal amount of Medium-Term Notes outstanding, with fixed interest rates ranging from 6.21% to
8.05%.

The Company has fixed cash flow requirements regarding these long-term
debt obligations due to the fixed rate of interest. The fair value of these obligations at December 31, 2006 and 2005, based on estimates of market rates for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities, was $277 million and
$352 million, respectively, compared to their carrying amounts of $262 million and $332 million, respectively.

Interest Rate Swaps

As part of its consolidated asset and liability management process, the Company utilizes Swaps to effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion of
its Medium Term Notes from fixed to variable. For a discussion of such Swaps, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 19. Financial Instruments Subject to
Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk, or Market Risk.”

Forward Sale
and Interest Rate Lock Commitments

For a discussion of Schwab
Bank’s forward sale and interest rate lock commitments related to its loans held for sale portfolio, see “Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – 19. Financial
Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk, or Market Risk.”

THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Net Interest Revenue Simulation

The Company uses net interest revenue simulation modeling techniques to evaluate and manage the effect of changing interest rates. The
simulation model (the model) includes all interest-sensitive assets and liabilities, as well as Swaps utilized by the Company to hedge its interest rate risk. Key variables in the model include assumed balance growth or decline for client loans,
deposits, brokerage client cash, changes in the level and term structure of interest rates, the repricing of financial instruments, prepayment and reinvestment assumptions, and product pricing assumptions. The simulations involve assumptions that
are inherently uncertain and, as a result, cannot precisely estimate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing,
magnitude, and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies, including changes in asset and liability mix.

As demonstrated by the simulations presented below, the Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in
net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest-earning assets are repricing more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities).

The forward-looking simulations in the following table exclude all of U.S. Trust’s
net interest revenue in 2006 and assume that the sale will close early in the third quarter of 2007. In addition, the simulations assume that the asset and liability structure of the consolidated balance sheet would not be changed as a result of the
simulated changes in interest rates. As the Company actively manages its consolidated balance sheet and interest rate exposure, in all likelihood the Company would take steps to manage any additional interest rate exposure that could result from
changes in the interest rate environment. The following table shows the results of a gradual 200 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates relative to the Company’s current base rate forecast on simulated net interest revenue over the
next twelve months at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

December 31,



Increase of 200 basis points

5.4

%

The simulations show an increase in
exposure to rate changes at December 31, 2006 from December 31, 2005, and the Company remains positioned to experience increases in net interest revenue as rates rise and decreases as rates fall. If U.S. Trust’s net interest
revenue is excluded from the 2005 simulations, the simulations would have shown net interest revenue increasing 7.5% for an increase of 200 basis points and decreasing 7.5% for a decline of 200 basis points.

Introduction and Basis of Presentation

The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC) is a financial holding company engaged, through its subsidiaries, in securities brokerage, banking, and related financial services.
Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. (Schwab) is a securities broker-dealer with 303 domestic branch offices in 45 states, as well as a branch in each of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and London, U.K. In addition, Schwab serves clients in Hong Kong
through one of CSC’s subsidiaries. Other subsidiaries include Charles Schwab Bank, N.A. (Schwab Bank), a retail bank; Charles Schwab Investment Management, Inc., the investment advisor for Schwab’s proprietary mutual funds; CyberTrader,
Inc., an electronic trading technology and brokerage firm providing services to highly active, online traders; and The Charles Schwab Trust Company, a trustee for employee benefit plans, primarily 401(k) plans.

The consolidated financial statements include CSC and its majority-owned subsidiaries
(collectively referred to as the Company). These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts in the accompanying financial statements. Such estimates relate to capitalized development costs for internal-use software; useful lives of intangible assets, equipment, office facilities, and property; valuation of
goodwill, intangible assets, and equity investments; valuation of employee stock options; future value of long-term incentive plan units; fair value of financial instruments and investments; allowance for credit losses on banking loans; allowance
for doubtful accounts of brokerage clients; retirement and postretirement benefits; future tax benefits; restructuring reserves; and legal reserves. Actual results could differ from such estimates. Certain prior-year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the 2006 presentation. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

On November 19, 2006, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Bank of America Corporation (Bank of America) pursuant to which Bank of America will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of
U.S. Trust Corporation (USTC, and with its subsidiaries collectively referred to as U.S. Trust), a subsidiary which provides wealth management services. The transaction is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2007. The Company
sold its capital markets business in 2004. These financial statements reflect these businesses as discontinued operations for all periods.

On December 22, 2006, the Company announced an agreement to acquire The 401(k) Company from Nationwide Financial Services, Inc. for $115 million in cash. The
transaction is expected to close in March 2007, subject to customary closing conditions. The 401(k) Company offers defined contribution plan services.

Significant Accounting Policies

Securities transactions

: Clients’ securities transactions are recorded on the date that they settle, while the related commission revenues and expenses are
recorded on the date that the trade occurs. Principal transactions are recorded on a trade date basis. Commission revenues and principal transactions are included in trading revenue.

Cash and cash equivalents

: The Company considers all highly liquid investments, including money market funds, interest-bearing
deposits with banks, federal funds sold, commercial paper and treasury securities, with original maturities of three months or less that are not segregated and on deposit for federal or other regulatory purposes to be cash equivalents.

Cash and investments segregated and on deposit for federal or other regulatory purposes

consist primarily of securities purchased under agreements to resell (resale agreements), which are collateralized by U.S. government securities, and certificates of deposit. Resale agreements are collateralized investing transactions that are
recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued interest. The Company obtains possession of collateral (U.S. government securities) with a market value equal to or in excess of the principal amount loaned and accrued interest under resale
agreements. Collateral is valued daily by the Company, with additional collateral obtained when necessary. Certificates of deposit are recorded at market value.

Securities borrowed, securities loaned, and securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase
agreements)

: Securities borrowed require the Company to deliver cash to the lender in exchange for securities and are included in receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. For securities loaned, the Company receives
collateral in the form of cash in an amount generally equal to the market value of securities loaned. Securities loaned are included in payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. The Company monitors the market value of securities
borrowed and loaned, with additional collateral obtained or refunded when necessary. Fees received or paid are recorded in interest revenue or interest expense. Repurchase agreements are recorded at their contractual amounts plus accrued interest
and are included in short-term borrowings.

Securities owned

include
securities available for sale that are recorded at estimated fair value using quoted market prices, where available, or third-party pricing services. Unrealized gains and losses are reported, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) included in stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses from sales of securities available for sale are determined on a specific identification basis and are included in other revenue.

Securities owned also include Schwab Funds

®

money market funds, fixed income, equity, and other securities, and equity and bond
mutual funds and are recorded at estimated fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are included in trading revenue.

Receivables from brokerage clients

are stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $2 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Cash receivables from
brokerage clients that remain unsecured or partially secured for more than 30 days are fully reserved.

Nonperforming assets

included in the loan portfolio consist of financial instruments where the Company has stopped accruing interest (non-accrual financial instruments). Interest accruals are discontinued when
principal or interest is contractually past due 90 days or more unless collectibility of the loan is reasonably assured. Non-accrual financial instruments are generally returned to accrual status only when all delinquent principal and interest
payments become current and the collectibility of future principal and interest on a timely basis is reasonably assured.

Loans to banking clients

are stated net of allowance for credit losses of $4 million and $3 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The
allowance is established through charges to income based on management’s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses in the existing portfolio. The adequacy of the allowance is reviewed regularly by management, taking into
consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience and risks inherent in the portfolio, including the value of impaired loans.

Loans held for sale

consist of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans intended for sale. Loans held for sale are stated at
lower of cost or market value. Market value is determined using quoted market prices.

Equipment, office facilities, and property

: Equipment and office facilities are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset of three to ten years. Buildings are depreciated on a straight-line
basis over twenty years. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the lease. Software and certain costs incurred for purchasing or developing software for
internal use are amortized on a straight-line basis over an estimated useful life of three or five years. Equipment, office facilities, and property are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, except for land, which is
stated at cost. Equipment, office facilities, and property are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable.

Derivative financial instruments

are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value based
upon dealer quotes and third-party pricing services. As part of its consolidated asset and liability management process, the Company utilizes interest rate swap agreements (Swaps) to effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion
of its Medium-Term Notes from fixed to variable. These Swaps have been designated as fair value hedges. There is no impact on net income as changes in fair value of the Swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged Medium-Term Notes.

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except
Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)

Schwab Bank’s loans held for sale portfolio consists of fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages, which are subject
to a loss in value when market interest rates rise. Schwab Bank uses forward sale commitments to manage this risk. These forward sale commitments have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments of the loans held for sale. Accordingly, the fair
values of these forward sale commitments are recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss).

Additionally, Schwab Bank uses forward sale commitments to hedge interest rate lock commitments issued on mortgage loans that will be held
for sale. Schwab Bank considers the fair value of these commitments to be zero at the commitment date, with subsequent changes in fair value determined solely based on changes in market interest rates. Any changes in fair value of the interest rate
lock commitments are completely offset by changes in fair value of the related forward sale commitments.

Income taxes

: The Company files a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and uses the asset and liability method in recording income tax expense. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their recorded amounts for financial reporting purposes, using currently enacted tax law.

Stock-based compensation:

On January 1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123
(revised 2004) – Share-Based Payment (SFAS No. 123R) which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense based on estimated fair values for all share-based payment arrangements including employee and director stock
option and restricted stock awards. In March 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB No. 107) relating to certain issues surrounding the implementation of SFAS No. 123R. In
November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123R-3 – Transition Election Related to Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.

The Company adopted SFAS No. 123R using a modified prospective transition method, under
which this accounting standard applies to new awards and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after January 1, 2006 and prior periods are not restated. Additionally, compensation cost is recognized for the unvested portion of awards
outstanding on January 1, 2006 over their remaining vesting period. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company’s income from continuing operations before income taxes, income from continuing operations, and net income
for the year ended December 31, 2006, were $13 million, $8 million, and $11 million lower, respectively, than under the Company’s previous accounting method for share-based compensation. When calculated under the
Company’s previous accounting method, basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) for the year ended December 31, 2006 were unchanged and $.01 higher, respectively.

Stock-based compensation expense for 2006 is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, and therefore has been reduced for estimated
forfeitures. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on the Company’s historical forfeiture experience and revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. For periods prior to 2006, the Company
recognized forfeitures as they occurred. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company recorded an immaterial cumulative adjustment to estimate forfeitures for unvested stock awards outstanding at January 1, 2006. The Company has elected to
adopt the alternative transition method provided in the FASB Staff Position No. FAS 123R-3 for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation.

Long-term incentive compensation:

Eligible officers may receive cash long-term incentive plan units under a long-term incentive plan (LTIP). These awards are
restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest annually over a three- to four-year period. Each award provides for a one-time cash payment for an amount that varies based upon the Company’s cumulative EPS over the respective performance
period of each grant. The Company accrues the estimated total cost for each grant on a straight-line basis over each LTIP’s vesting period, with periodic cumulative adjustments to expense as estimates of the total grant cost are revised.

Goodwill:

represents the cost of acquired businesses in excess of the
fair value of the related net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or whenever indications of impairment exist. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, management estimates the fair value of each of the
Company’s reporting units (generally

- 46 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except
Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)

defined as the Company’s businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by
management), and compares it to their carrying value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, management is required to estimate the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including
goodwill. If the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill is greater than the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess. The Company has elected April 1 as its annual impairment testing date.

The carrying amount of goodwill is included in the Schwab Investor Services
segment. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company’s goodwill balance was $419 million.

Intangible assets

: The Company has certain intangible assets which are non-amortizing but are subject to impairment testing annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying
amount may not be recoverable. The Company’s non-amortizing intangible asset balances were $14 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005, and are included in other assets. These balances are primarily comprised of the value of
contracts acquired in 2004 to manage investments of mutual funds.

New
accounting standards:

SFAS No. 154 – Accounting Changes and Error Corrections was issued in May 2005 and was effective beginning January 1, 2006. SFAS No. 154 generally requires retrospective application to prior
periods’ financial statements of changes in accounting principle. The adoption of SFAS No. 154 did not have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, EPS, or cash flows.

SFAS No. 155 – Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments was issued in
February 2006 and is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 155 allows financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to
account for the embedded derivative separately) if an election is made to report the whole instrument on a fair value basis. The adoption of SFAS No. 155 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position,
results of operations, EPS, or cash flows.

SFAS No. 156 – Accounting
for Servicing of Financial Assets was issued in March 2006 and is effective beginning January 1, 2007. This statement amends the requirements under SFAS No. 140 – Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and
Extinguishments of Liabilities, for accounting for mortgage servicing assets and servicing liabilities. Currently, servicing assets and servicing liabilities are amortized over the expected period of estimated net servicing income or loss and
assessed for impairment or increased obligation at each reporting date. SFAS No. 156 requires that all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities be initially measured at fair value, and permits, but does not require, the
subsequent measurement of servicing assets and servicing liabilities at fair value. The adoption of SFAS No. 156 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, EPS, or cash flows.

SFAS No. 157 – Fair Value Measurements was issued in September 2006
and is effective beginning January 1, 2008. This Statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS
No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, EPS, or cash flows.

SFAS No. 158 – Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other
Postretirement Plans was issued in September 2006. SFAS No. 158 requires recognition of an asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans, and recognition of changes in that funded status
through other comprehensive income. The funded status of a benefit plan is generally measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation. SFAS No. 158 also requires the recognition of previously
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs within accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax. These provisions of the statement are effective December 31, 2006. All of the Company’s defined postretirement
benefit plans are maintained at U.S. Trust. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 resulted in a $9 million pre-tax reduction in prepaid postretirement benefit plans and a $5 million after-tax reduction in the Company’s accumulated
other comprehensive income as of

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except

December 31, 2006. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 did not have any impact on the Company’s results of
operations, EPS, or cash flows. Effective December 31, 2008, SFAS No. 158 requires the measurement date for plan assets and liabilities to be the same date as a company’s fiscal year end.

SFAS No. 159 – The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities
was issued in February 2007 and is effective beginning January 1, 2008. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to elect to measure eligible financial instruments, commitments, and certain other arrangements at fair value at specified election dates
with changes in fair value recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 on its financial position, results of operations, EPS, and cash flows.

Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No. 43 – Accounting for Compensated Absences, was ratified by the FASB in June 2006 and is effective beginning January 1, 2007. This EITF requires the recognition
of compensation expense associated with a sabbatical leave or other similar benefit arrangement that does not vest over the requisite service period. The Company currently records compensation expense related to its sabbatical program in the period
the sabbatical is taken by an employee. As a result of this change in accounting principle, the Company will record a charge, net of estimated forfeitures, to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007 of $17 million after tax. This
accounting change is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, EPS, or cash flows.

Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 48 – Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - An Interpretation of SFAS No. 109, was
issued in July 2006 and is effective beginning January 1, 2007. FIN No. 48 provides new requirements for the recognition, measurement, and disclosure in the financial statements of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return when there is uncertainty about whether that tax position will ultimately be sustained. The adoption of FIN No. 48 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, EPS, or cash
flows.

Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 108 – Considering the
Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements was issued by the SEC in September 2006 and is effective for the year ended December 31, 2006. SAB No. 108 requires a dual approach
– evaluation of an error from both a financial position perspective and results of operations perspective – when quantifying and evaluating the materiality of a misstatement. The adoption of SAB No. 108 did not have a material impact
on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, EPS, or cash flows.

Discontinued Operations

U.S. Trust:

On November 19, 2006, CSC entered into a definitive agreement with Bank of America pursuant to which Bank of America will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion in
cash. The transaction is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2007. However, the closing is subject to (i) approval of new investment advisor agreements for each of the Excelsior mutual funds by the applicable public fund board and
the stockholders of each fund, (ii) regulatory approvals, and (iii) other customary closing conditions. The Company estimates it will record a pre-tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.9 billion. After-tax proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and continued investment in Schwab Investor Services, Schwab Institutional, and Schwab Bank. U.S. Trust comprised all of the previously-reported U.S. Trust segment.

The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of U.S. Trust have been
presented as discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for all periods, and the assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust have each been combined and presented as assets and liabilities of
discontinued operations on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s consolidated prior period revenues, expenses, taxes on income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows also reflect this presentation.

Summarized financial information for discontinued operations related to U.S. Trust is as follows:

The components of income from
discontinued operations related to U.S. Trust are as follows:

(1)

Includes $6 million pre-tax, or $4 million after tax, of transaction-related costs recorded in
2006.

(2)

Includes an income tax benefit of $205 million recorded in 2006 related to the estimated excess of
the tax basis of U.S. Trust stock over the book basis.

In 2006, the Company recorded a $205 million income tax benefit related to the estimated difference between the tax and book bases of the Company’s U.S. Trust stock. This amount is included in income from discontinued
operations, net of tax on the Company’s consolidated statements of income. When calculating the Company’s gain on the sale of U.S. Trust for income tax purposes, the tax basis will be the basis of U.S. Trust’s prior
stockholders in their shares as of the date U.S. Trust was acquired by the Company, since the transaction qualified as a tax-free exchange. This tax benefit is management’s current estimate and is based on publicly available information,
including information on the composition of U.S. Trust’s stockholders at the acquisition date and the market price of U.S. Trust stock during relevant periods. The final amount of the basis difference, which could differ from
management’s estimate, will be determined following a survey of former U.S. Trust stockholders that the Company expects to complete in mid-2007.

The assets retained from discontinued operations reflect the excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client
accounts that is swept into a money market deposit account at U.S. Trust. In 2007, Schwab will terminate this arrangement prior to the closing of the sale of U.S. Trust and move these balances to a similar existing arrangement with Schwab
Bank. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, these balances totaled $749 million and $711 million, respectively, and are included in deposits from banking clients with a corresponding amount in assets retained from discontinued operations on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The interest expense related to these client deposit balances is included in interest expense from continuing operations on the Company’s consolidated statements of income of $11 million,
$6 million, and $2 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The corresponding interest revenue on the invested cash balances related to these deposits is included in interest revenue from continuing operations on the Company’s
consolidated statements of income of $38 million, $22 million, and $6 million for 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. The interest revenue amount is calculated using the Company’s funds transfer pricing methodology, which is used
by management to estimate the interest earned on the investment of these deposit balances.

Capital Markets Business:

In October 2004,
the Company sold its capital markets business to UBS Securities LLC and UBS Americas Inc. (collectively referred to as UBS). Pursuant to the agreement, UBS acquired all of the partnership interests of Schwab Capital Markets L.P. and all of the
outstanding capital stock of SoundView Technology Group, Inc. (collectively referred to as Schwab Soundview Capital Markets, or SSCM) for $265 million in cash. A summary of revenues and losses in 2004 for discontinued operations related to SSCM
is as follows: net revenues of $226 million; loss on sale of $88 million, which includes goodwill impairment charges of $95 million; total pre-tax loss of $199 million; and after-tax loss of $128 million. Additionally, the
Company recorded income of $4 million, or $3 million after tax, in 2006 and income of $5 million, or loss of $5 million after tax, in 2005.

In addition to the restructuring reserves discussed in note “16 – Restructuring Charges and Reserves,” the Company retained certain restructuring-related
obligations following the sales of SSCM and Charles Schwab Europe in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and recorded reserves for severance, facilities leases and systems. A summary of the activity in these reserves is as follows:

(1)

Included in income (loss) from discontinued operations.

(2)

Primarily includes charges for officers’ stock-based compensation and write-downs of fixed assets.

(3)

Includes the reclassification of deferred rent amounts and the accretion of facilities restructuring
reserves, which are initially recorded at net present value.

(4)

The Company expects to substantially utilize the remaining facilities reduction reserve through cash
payments for the net lease expense over the respective lease terms through 2015.

Loans to Banking Clients and Related Allowance for Credit Losses

An analysis of the composition of the loan portfolio is as follows:

Included in the loan portfolio are
non-accrual loans totaling $1 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. Non-accrual loans are considered impaired by the Company, and represent all the Company’s nonperforming assets at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. The
amount of loans accruing interest that were contractually 90 days or more past due was $1 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. For 2006 and 2005, the impact of interest revenue which would have been earned on non-accrual loans
versus interest revenue recognized on these loans was not material to the Company’s results of operations.

Charge-offs related to the allowance for credit losses on the loan portfolio were not material for both 2006 and 2004. There were no charge-offs during 2005. There were
no recoveries for each of 2006, 2005, and 2004.

Deposits from Banking Clients

Deposits from banking clients consist of money market and other savings deposits, certificates of deposit, and noninterest-bearing deposits. Interest-bearing deposits
were $11.0 billion and $7.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Company paid an average rate of 2.19% and 1.32%, respectively, on its interest-bearing
deposits from banking clients. Noninterest-bearing deposits were not material at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. Demand deposit overdrafts included as other loans within loans to banking clients were not material for both December 31,
2006 and 2005.

Payables to Brokers, Dealers, and Clearing Organizations

Payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations consist primarily of securities loaned of $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2006 and
2005, respectively. The cash collateral received from counterparties under securities lending transactions was equal to or greater than the market value of the securities loaned.

10.

Payables to Brokerage Clients

The principal source of funding for Schwab’s margin lending is cash balances in brokerage client accounts. At December 31, 2006, Schwab was paying interest at
2.5% on $15.8 billion of cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were included in payables to brokerage clients. At December 31, 2005, Schwab was paying interest at 2.1% on $20.9 billion of such cash balances.

11.

Borrowings

CSC may borrow up to $800 million under a committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of eighteen banks which is scheduled to expire in June 2007. This facility replaced a facility that expired in June
2006. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes and CSC pays a commitment fee on the unused balance of this facility. The financial covenants in this facility require CSC to maintain a minimum level of
stockholders’ equity, Schwab to maintain minimum net capital ratios, as defined, and CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries, which include Schwab Bank and U.S. Trust (currently reflected as a discontinued operation for financial
statement purposes) to be well capitalized, as defined. These facilities were unused at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

To manage short-term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of eight banks totaling $842 million at December 31,
2006. CSC has access to $792 million of these credit lines. The amount available to CSC under these lines is lower than the amount available to Schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to Schwab. There
were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

To satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured letter of credit agreements with eleven banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $930 million at
December 31, 2006. Schwab pays a fee to maintain these arrangements. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by
arranging letters of credit (LOCs), in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate face amount of these outstanding LOCs totaled $173 million. No funds were drawn under these
LOCs at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

Long-term debt consists of the
following:

8.05%, respectively. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the Medium-Term Notes carried a weighted-average interest rate of 7.77% and 7.56%, respectively.

Upon adoption of FIN No. 46 in the first quarter of 2003, the Company
consolidated a Trust and recorded a note payable of $235 million. This Trust was formed in 2000 to finance the acquisition and renovation of an office building and land. In 2004, the Company exercised its option to purchase this property from
the Trust and repaid $99 million of the note payable. Simultaneously, the Company completed a transaction on this property with American Financial Realty Trust, a publicly-traded real estate investment trust, resulting in proceeds of
$136 million, which was used to repay the remainder of the note payable, and a 20-year lease. This transaction was accounted for as a financing lease. The remaining lease financing liability of $126 million at December 31, 2006 is
being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the 20-year term.

Annual
maturities on long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 are as follows:

Taxes on Income

Income tax expense on income from continuing operations is as follows:

The excess tax benefits from the
exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted stock awards, which for accounting purposes are recorded in additional paid-in capital, were $64 million, $30 million, and $16 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

- 55 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except
Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)

The net income tax benefit from discontinued operations was $134 million in 2006 and includes a
$205 million income tax benefit related to the estimated excess of the tax basis of U.S. Trust stock over the book basis. The income tax expense related to income from discontinued operations was $71 million in 2005. The income tax
benefit related to loss from discontinued operations was $37 million in 2004.

The temporary differences that created deferred tax assets and liabilities are detailed below:

The Company determined that no
valuation allowance against deferred tax assets at December 31, 2006 and 2005 was necessary.

The effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations differs from the amount computed by applying the federal statutory income tax rate as follows:

The effective income tax rate
including discontinued operations was 26.9% in 2006, 39.0% in 2005, and 35.9% in 2004. In 2006, the difference between the effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations and the effective income tax rate including discontinued
operations was primarily due to the $205 million income tax benefit discussed above.

Employee Incentive, Deferred Compensation, and Retirement Plans

A summary of the Company’s stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefit is as follows:

(1)

Effective January 1, 2006, stock-based compensation is computed net of expected forfeitures.

(2)

Total stock-based compensation including discontinued operations was $52 million, $23 million,
and $62 million in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

The Company issues shares for stock options and restricted stock awards from treasury stock. At December 31, 2006, the Company was authorized to grant up to 36 million common shares under its existing stock incentive plans.

As of December 31, 2006, there was $135 million of total
unrecognized compensation cost, net of forfeitures, related to outstanding stock option and restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized through 2011 with a remaining weighted-average period of 2.0 years.

Stock Option Plans

The Company’s stock incentive plans provide for granting options to employees, officers, and directors. Options are granted for the
purchase of shares of common stock at an exercise price not less than market value on the date of grant, and expire within seven or ten years from the date of grant. Options generally vest annually over a three- to four-year period from the date of
grant. Certain options are granted at an exercise price above the market value of common stock on the date of grant (i.e., premium-priced options).

The Company’s stock option activity (including options held by employees of discontinued operations) is summarized below:

The aggregate intrinsic value in the
table above represents the difference between CSC’s closing stock price and the exercise price of each in-the-money option on the last trading day of the period presented.

The weighted-average fair value of options granted during each of the years 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $5.43, $2.56, and $2.75 per share,
respectively. Cash received from options exercised for each of the years 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $252 million, $115 million, and $51 million, respectively. The total tax benefits recognized from the exercise of employee stock options
during each of the years 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $57 million, $30 million, and $23 million,

- 57 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except
Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)

respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during each of the years 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $149 million, $80 million and
$63 million, respectively.

Management uses a binomial option pricing
model for all options granted. The binomial model takes into account the contractual term of the stock option, expected volatility, dividend yield, and risk-free interest rate. Expected volatility is based on the implied volatility of
publicly-traded options on CSC’s stock. Dividend yield is based on the average historical CSC dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield of a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issue with a remaining term equal to the contractual
term of the option. Management uses historical option exercise data, which includes employee termination data to estimate future option exercise probability. Management uses the Black-Scholes model to solve for the expected life of options valued
with the binomial model. The assumptions used to value the Company’s options and their expected life were as follows:

Pro Forma Information for Periods Prior to the Adoption of SFAS No. 123R

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the Company applied Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 and related
interpretations, for its stock-based employee compensation plans. Because the Company grants stock option awards at an exercise price not less than market value, there was no compensation expense recorded when the awards were granted. Had
compensation expense for the Company’s stock option awards been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the fair value method of SFAS No. 123, the Company would have recorded
additional compensation expense and its net income and EPS would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts presented in the following table:

(1)

Includes discontinued operations.

(2)

Includes pro forma compensation expense related to stock options granted during the periods presented
and prior periods.

Restricted Stock Plans

The Company’s stock incentive plans provide for granting restricted stock awards to
employees and officers. Restricted stock awards are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest annually over a four-year period, but some vest based upon the Company or one of its subsidiaries achieving certain financial or other measures.
The fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant and is generally amortized to restricted stock expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The total fair
value of the

- 58 -

Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)

restricted stock awards that vested during each of the years 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $55 million, $33 million, and $44 million, respectively.

The unrecognized compensation cost of $81 million related to outstanding
restricted stock awards was recorded as unamortized stock-based compensation in stockholders’ equity at December 31, 2005. With the adoption of SFAS No. 123R, the unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding restricted stock
awards granted prior to January 1, 2006 was charged to additional paid-in capital.

The Company’s restricted stock awards activity (including awards held by employees of discontinued operations) is summarized below:

Long-term Incentive Plans

Eligible officers may receive LTIP units under the Company’s
long-term incentive program. These awards are restricted from transfer or sale and generally vest annually over a three- to four-year performance period. The cash payout of the LTIP units, which may range from $0 to $4 per unit, will be made
following the end of the performance period based upon the Company achieving certain cumulative EPS levels.

LTIP unit information (including units held by employees of discontinued operations) is as follows:

Other Deferred Compensation Plans

The Company sponsors deferred compensation plans for eligible officers
and non-employee directors. The Company’s deferred compensation plan for officers permits participants to defer the payment of certain cash compensation. The deferred compensation liability was $145 million and $129 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company’s deferred compensation plan for non-employee directors permits participants to defer receipt of all or a portion of their directors’ fees and to receive either a grant of stock
options, or upon ceasing to serve as a director, the number of shares of CSC’s common stock that would have resulted from investing the deferred fee amount into CSC’s common stock.

Retirement Plan

Eligible employees of the Company who have met certain service requirements may
participate in the Company’s qualified retirement plan, the SchwabPlan

Retirement
Savings and Investment Plan. The Company may match certain employee contributions or make additional contributions to this plan at its discretion. Total company contribution expense was $47 million in 2006, $41 million in 2005, and

Earnings Per Share

Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares
plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding for the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and unvested restricted stock awards. EPS under the basic and diluted
computations are as follows:

(1)

Antidilutive stock options and restricted stock awards excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings
per share were 35 million, 71 million, and 91 million shares for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

Restructuring Charges and Reserves

In 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded pre-tax restructuring charges of $16 million and $186 million, respectively, primarily comprised of severance costs and
facilities reduction charges related to its past restructuring initiatives. These past restructuring initiatives were completed in the first half of 2005.

A summary of the activity in the restructuring reserve related to the Company’s past restructuring initiatives
is as follows:

(1)

Primarily includes charges for officers’ stock-based compensation and write-downs of fixed assets.

(2)

Includes the reclassification of deferred rent amounts in 2005 and the accretion of facilities
restructuring reserves in 2006, 2005, and 2004, which are initially recorded at net present value. Accretion expense is recorded in occupancy and equipment expense on the Company’s consolidated statements of income.

(3)

The Company expects to substantially utilize the remaining facilities reduction reserve through cash
payments for the net lease expense over the respective lease terms through 2017.

In addition to these restructuring reserves, see note “3 – Discontinued Operations” for a discussion of the Company’s restructuring reserves related to discontinued operations. All restructuring
reserve liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.

The actual costs of the remaining restructuring reserves related to these restructuring initiatives could differ from the estimated costs, depending primarily on the
Company’s ability to sublease properties.

17.

Regulatory Requirements

CSC is a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Act). In July 2006, USTC (currently reflected as a discontinued operation for financial statement purposes) became a financial holding company. The Act permits financial holding companies to engage in activities
that are financial in nature, including banking, securities brokerage, underwriting, dealing in or making a market in securities, investment management services and insurance activities. The Federal Reserve Board may impose limitations,
restrictions, or prohibitions on the activities or acquisitions of a financial holding company if the Federal Reserve Board believes that the company does not have the appropriate financial and managerial resources to commence or conduct an
activity, make an acquisition, or retain ownership of a company. The Federal Reserve Board may also take actions as appropriate to enforce applicable federal law.

Federal Reserve Board policy provides that a bank holding company generally should not pay cash dividends unless its net income is
sufficient to fully fund the dividends and the company’s prospective retained earnings appear to be sufficient to meet the capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition of the holding company and its depository institution
subsidiaries.

CSC’s primary depository institution subsidiaries are Schwab Bank and United States Trust Company, National
Association (United States Trust NA). The operations and financial condition of CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries are subject to regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law,
including regulatory capital guidelines. Among other things, these requirements govern transactions with CSC and its non-depository institution subsidiaries, including loans and other extensions of credit, investments or asset purchases, dividends
and investments. The federal banking agencies have broad powers to enforce these regulations, including the power to terminate deposit insurance, impose substantial fines and other civil and criminal penalties, and appoint a conservator or receiver.
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, CSC’s insured depository institutions could be subject to restrictive actions if they were to fall within one of the lowest three of five capital categories.

Under the Act, the Federal Reserve Board has established consolidated capital requirements
for bank holding companies. CSC and USTC are subject to those guidelines. The Act prohibits the Federal Reserve Board from imposing capital requirements on functionally regulated non-depository institution subsidiaries of a financial holding
company, such as broker-dealers and investment advisors.

status as a financial holding company, each of CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries must be kept “well capitalized” and “well managed.” In addition, each of CSC’s insured depository institution subsidiaries must be
rated “satisfactory” or better in meeting the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 in order for CSC to engage in new financial activities or enter into certain acquisitions of companies engaged in financial activities. At
December 31, 2006, CSC and its depository institution subsidiaries met all the above requirements.

The regulatory capital and ratios including discontinued operations are as follows:

N/A Not applicable.

(1)

In the first quarter of 2006, United States Trust Company of New York (U.S. Trust NY) and U.S.
Trust Company National Association (U.S. Trust NA) merged into a single national bank named United States Trust Company, National Association (United States Trust NA).

(2)

Schwab Bank was subject to a minimum tier 1 leverage ratio of 8% for its first three years of operations
(i.e., through April 2006).

(3)

Applicable only to depository institutions.

Based on their respective regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
Schwab Bank and United States Trust NA are considered well capitalized (the highest category) pursuant to banking regulatory guidelines. There are no conditions or events that management believes have changed Schwab Bank’s or United States
Trust NA’s well-capitalized status.

CSC’s depository institution subsidiaries are required, under federal regulations, to maintain reserve balances
at the Federal Reserve Bank based on deposit levels. These amounts are included in cash and investments segregated and on deposit for federal or other regulatory purposes. The average balances were $63 million in 2006 and $97 million in
2005.

Schwab is subject to the Uniform Net Capital Rule under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (the Rule). Schwab computes net capital under the alternative method permitted by this Rule. This method requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined, of the greater of 2% of aggregate debit balances arising from
client transactions or a minimum dollar requirement, which is based on the type of business conducted by the broker-dealer. At December 31, 2006, 2% of aggregate debits was $227 million, which exceeded the minimum dollar requirement for
Schwab of $250,000. At December 31, 2006, Schwab’s net capital was $1.1 billion (10% of aggregate debit balances), which was $850 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $511 million in excess of 5% of
aggregate debit balances. Under the alternative method, a broker-dealer may not repay subordinated borrowings, pay cash dividends, or make any unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less
than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement.

Schwab had portions of its cash and investments segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients at December 31, 2006, in accordance with applicable regulations.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities

Operating leases and other commitments:

The Company has noncancelable operating leases for office space and equipment. Future minimum rental commitments under
these leases, net of committed subleases, at December 31, 2006 are as follows:

Amounts include facilities under the Company’s restructuring initiatives.

Certain leases contain provisions for renewal options,
purchase options, and rent escalations based on increases in certain costs incurred by the lessor. Rent expense was $166 million in 2006, $164 million in 2005, and $213 million in 2004.

Purchase Obligations:

The Company has purchase obligations for services such as advertising and marketing,
telecommunications, professional services, and hardware- and software-related agreements. At December 31, 2006, the Company has purchase obligations as follows:

Guarantees:

The Company
recognizes, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the estimated fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The fair values of the obligations relating to standby LOCs are estimated based on fees charged to enter
into similar agreements, considering the creditworthiness of the counterparties. The fair values of the obligations relating to other guarantees are estimated based on transactions for similar guarantees or expected present value measures.

In the normal course of business, the Company provides certain
indemnifications (i.e., protection against damage or loss) to counterparties in connection with the disposition of certain of its assets. Such indemnifications are generally standard contractual terms with various expiration dates and typically
relate to title to the assets transferred, ownership of intellectual property rights (e.g., patents), accuracy of financial statements, compliance with laws and regulations, failure to pay, satisfy or discharge any liability, or to defend claims, as
well as errors, omissions, and misrepresentations. The maximum potential future liability under these indemnifications cannot be estimated. The Company has not recorded a liability for these indemnifications and believes that the occurrence of
events that would trigger payments under these agreements is remote.

Separately, the Company has guaranteed certain payments in the event of a termination of certain mutual fund
sub-advisor agreements, related to the adoption of AXA Rosenberg LLC’s U.S. family of mutual funds, known as the Laudus Funds

TM

. Additionally, the Company has provided indemnifications related to facility leases and technology services to a counterparty in connection with the disposition of certain of its assets. At December 31, 2006, the Company’s
maximum potential future liability under these agreements was approximately $140 million. Further, as discussed below under “Legal contingencies,” the Company provided an indemnification to UBS for expenses associated with certain
litigation. At December 31, 2006, the Company has a recorded liability of approximately $30 million reflecting the estimated fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications. The fair value of these guarantees and indemnifications is
not necessarily indicative of amounts that would be paid in the event a payment was required.

The Company has clients that sell (i.e., write) listed option contracts that are cleared by various clearing houses. The clearing houses establish margin requirements on these transactions. The Company satisfies the
margin requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of the clearing houses, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2006, the aggregate face amount of these outstanding LOCs totaled $930 million. In connection with its securities
lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31,
2006, the aggregate face amount of these outstanding LOCs totaled $173 million. No funds were drawn under these LOCs at December 31, 2006.

The Company also provides guarantees to securities clearing houses and exchanges under their standard membership agreement, which requires members to guarantee the
performance of other members. Under the agreement, if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing houses and exchanges, other members would be required to meet shortfalls. The Company’s liability under these
arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the cash and securities it has posted as collateral. However, the potential requirement for the Company to make payments under these arrangements is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been
recognized for these transactions.

Legal contingencies:

The Company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of business,
including arbitrations, class actions, and other litigation, some of which include claims for substantial or unspecified damages. The Company is also the subject of inquiries, investigations, and proceedings by regulatory and other governmental
agencies. In addition, the Company is responding to certain litigation claims brought against former subsidiaries pursuant to indemnities it has provided to purchasers of those entities.

The Company believes it has strong defenses in all significant matters currently pending and is vigorously contesting liability and the
damages claimed. Nevertheless, some of these matters may result in adverse judgments or awards, including penalties, injunctions, or other relief, and the Company may also determine to settle a matter because of the uncertainty and risks of
litigation. Predicting the outcome of a matter is inherently difficult, particularly where claimants seek substantial or unspecified damages, or when investigations or legal proceedings are at an early stage. In many cases, including most class
action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred or to estimate the range of that loss until the matter is close to resolution. However, based on current information and consultation with counsel, management believes
that the resolution of matters currently pending, including those described below, will not have a material adverse impact on the financial condition or cash flows of the Company, but could be material to the Company’s operating results for a
particular future period, depending on results for that period.

As part of the
sale of SSCM to UBS, the Company agreed to indemnify UBS for expenses associated with certain litigation, including multiple purported securities class actions against SoundView and certain of its subsidiaries filed in the United District Court for
the Southern District of New York, brought on behalf of persons who either directly or in the aftermarket purchased IPO securities between March 1997 and December 2000. The Company is vigorously contesting the claims on behalf of SoundView.

Financial Instruments Subject to Off-Balance Sheet Risk, Credit Risk, or Market Risk

Securities lending:

Through Schwab, the Company loans client securities temporarily to other brokers in connection with its
securities lending activities. The Company receives cash as collateral for the securities loaned. Increases in security prices may cause the market value of the securities loaned to exceed the amount of cash received as collateral. In the event the
counterparty to these transactions does not return the loaned securities or provide additional cash collateral, the Company may be exposed to the risk of acquiring the securities at prevailing market prices in order to satisfy its client
obligations. The Company mitigates this risk by requiring credit approvals for counterparties, by monitoring the market value of securities loaned, and by requiring additional cash as collateral when necessary. The market value of Schwab’s
client securities pledged in securities lending transactions to other broker-dealers was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Additionally, Schwab borrows securities from other broker-dealers to
fulfill short sales of its clients. The market value of these borrowed securities was $401 million and $474 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Client trade settlement:

The Company is obligated to settle transactions with brokers and other financial institutions even if its
clients fail to meet their obligations to the Company. Clients are required to complete their transactions on settlement date, generally three business days after trade date. If clients do not fulfill their contractual obligations, the Company may
incur losses. The Company has established procedures to reduce this risk by requiring deposits from clients in excess of amounts prescribed by regulatory requirements for certain types of trades, and therefore the potential for Schwab to make
payments under these client transactions is remote. Accordingly, no liability has been recognized for these transactions.

Margin lending:

Schwab provides margin loans to its clients which are collateralized by securities in their brokerage accounts. Schwab may be liable for the margin
requirement of its client margin securities transactions. As clients write options or sell securities short, the Company may incur losses if the clients do not fulfill their obligations and the collateral in client accounts is not sufficient to
fully cover losses which clients may incur from these strategies. To mitigate this risk, the Company monitors required margin levels and clients are required to deposit additional collateral,

- 67 -


THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except
Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)

or reduce positions, when necessary. Clients with margin loans have agreed to allow Schwab to pledge collateralized securities in their brokerage accounts in
accordance with federal regulations. Schwab was allowed, under such regulations, to pledge securities with a market value of $14.8 billion and $14.9 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The market value of
Schwab’s client securities pledged to fulfill the short sales of its clients was $1.4 billion and $925 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The market value of Schwab’s client securities pledged to fulfill
Schwab’s proprietary short sales was $33 million and $22 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Schwab has also pledged a portion of its securities owned in order to fulfill the short sales of clients and in
connection with securities lending transactions to other broker-dealers. The market value of these pledged securities was $5 million at both December 31, 2006 and 2005. The Company may also pledge client securities to fulfill client margin
requirements for open option contracts established with the OCC. The market value of these pledged securities to the OCC was $151 million and $595 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Financial instruments held for trading purposes:

The Company maintains inventories in
securities on a long and short basis relating to its fixed income operations. The Company could incur losses or gains as a result of changes in the market value of these securities. To mitigate the risk of losses, long and short positions are marked
to market and are monitored by management to assure compliance with limits established by the Company.

Resale and repurchase agreements:

Schwab enters into collateralized resale agreements principally with other broker-dealers, which could result in losses in the event the counterparty to the transaction does
not purchase the securities held as collateral for the cash advanced and the market value of these securities declines. To mitigate this risk, Schwab requires that the counterparty deliver securities to a custodian, to be held as collateral, with a
market value in excess of the resale price. Schwab also sets standards for the credit quality of the counterparty, monitors the market value of the underlying securities as compared to the related receivable, including accrued interest, and requires
additional collateral where deemed appropriate. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the market value of collateral received in connection with resale agreements that is available to be repledged or sold was $4.8 billion and $8.2 billion,
respectively. For Schwab to repledge or sell this collateral, it would be required to deposit into its segregated reserve bank accounts cash and/or securities of an equal amount in order to meet its segregated cash and investment requirement.

Concentration risk:

The Company’s most significant concentration
of risk is its exposure to securities issued or collateralized by the U.S. Government and its agencies (U.S. Government securities). The Company’s direct market risk exposure, primarily from investments in securities available for sale,
amounted to $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The Company maintains indirect exposure to U.S. Government securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Company’s
primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government securities only in the event of the counterparty’s default on the resale agreements. U.S. Government
securities held as collateral for resale agreements at December 31, 2006 and 2005 totaled $4.8 billion and $8.2 billion, respectively.

Commitments to extend credit:

In the normal course of business, Schwab Bank enters into various transactions involving off-balance sheet financial instruments to
meet the needs of their clients and to reduce their own exposure to interest rate risk. The credit risk associated with these instruments varies depending on the creditworthiness of the client and the value of any collateral held. Collateral
requirements vary by type of instrument. The contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amounts at risk should the contract be fully drawn upon, the client default, and the value of any existing collateral become worthless.

Credit-related financial instruments represent firm commitments to extend credit (firm
commitments). Firm commitments are legally binding agreements to lend to a client that generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, may require payment of a fee and are not secured by collateral until funds are advanced.
Collateral held includes marketable securities, real estate mortgages or other assets. The majority of Schwab Bank’s firm commitments are related to mortgage lending to banking clients. Firm commitments totaled $2.7 billion and
$2.2 billion at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Interest rate Swaps:

CSC uses Swaps to effectively convert the interest rate characteristics of a portion of
its Medium-Term Notes from fixed to variable. These Swaps are structured for CSC to receive a fixed rate of interest and pay a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR rate. The variable interest rates reset every three months.
Information on these Swaps is summarized in the following table:

These Swaps have been designated as
fair value hedges under SFAS No. 133, and are recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. Changes in fair value of the Swaps are offset by changes in fair value of the hedged Medium-Term Notes. Therefore, there is no effect
on net income. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, CSC recorded a derivative asset of approximately $500,000 and $2 million, respectively, for these Swaps. Concurrently, the carrying value of the Medium-Term Notes was increased by approximately
$500,000 and $2 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

Forward sale and interest rate lock commitments:

Schwab Bank’s loans held for sale portfolio consists of fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages, which are subject to a loss in value when market interest rates rise. Schwab Bank
uses forward sale commitments to manage this risk. These forward sale commitments have been designated as cash flow hedging instruments of the loans held for sale. Accordingly, the fair values of these forward sale commitments are recorded on the
Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss). Amounts included in other comprehensive income (loss) are reclassified into earnings when the related loan is sold. At both
December 31, 2006 and 2005, the derivative asset and liability recorded by Schwab Bank for these forward sale commitments was immaterial.

Additionally, Schwab Bank uses forward sale commitments to hedge interest rate lock commitments issued on mortgage loans that will be held for sale. Schwab Bank considers
the fair value of these commitments to be zero at the commitment date, with subsequent changes in fair value determined solely based on changes in market interest rates. Any changes in fair value of the interest rate lock commitments are completely
offset by changes in fair value of the related forward sale commitments. Schwab Bank had interest rate lock commitments on mortgage loans to be held for sale with principal balances totaling approximately $122 million and $112 million at
December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. At both December 31, 2006 and 2005, the derivative asset and liability recorded by Schwab Bank for these interest rate lock commitments and the related forward sale commitments was immaterial.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

Substantially all of the Company’s financial instruments are recorded at estimated fair value or amounts that approximate fair value. The carrying amounts (as
recorded on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet) and estimated fair values of the Company’s financial instruments are as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents, cash and
investments segregated, receivables, deposits from banking clients, payables, accrued expenses and other liabilities

are short-term in nature and accordingly are recorded at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value.

Securities owned

are recorded at estimated fair value. Such fair values are estimated
using quoted market prices, where available, or third-party pricing services.

Loans to banking clients:

The fair value of the Company’s loans are estimated using discounted contractual cash flows adjusted for current prepayment estimates. The discount rates used are based on the interest rates charged to
current clients for comparable loans.

Loans held for sale

: The fair
value of the Company’s loans held for sale are estimated using the quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans.

Swaps:

The fair value of the Company’s Swaps are estimated by obtaining quotes from dealers and third-party pricing services.

Long-term debt:

A portion of the Company’s long-term debt has been adjusted for
changes in the fair value of Swaps. The fair value of the Company’s long-term debt is estimated using third-party pricing services and discounted cash flow analyses utilizing discount rates currently available for similar instruments.

Off-balance sheet financial instruments:

In the normal course of
business, the Company is a party to certain off-balance sheet financial instruments, primarily consisting of firm commitments, which represent obligations of the Company. As of December 31, 2006, 10% of these commitments mature within one year.
The fair value of firm commitments is estimated based on fees charged to enter into similar agreements, considering the creditworthiness of the

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

(Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except
Per Share Data, Option Price Amounts, Ratios, and as Noted)

counterparties. The Company has reviewed the unfunded portion of its firm commitments and determined that the fair values of these instruments were
immaterial at December 31, 2006 and 2005.

21.

Segment Information

Operating segments are defined as components of a company in which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or decision-making group, in deciding how to allocate
resources and in assessing performance. The Company structures its operating segments according to its various types of clients and the services provided to those clients. The Company’s two reportable segments are Schwab Investor Services and
Schwab Institutional. As a result of the Company’s pending sale of U.S. Trust in 2006 and exit from the capital markets business in 2004, the previously-reported U.S. Trust and Capital Markets segments have been eliminated.

The Schwab Investor Services segment includes the Company’s retail
brokerage and banking operations, as well as the division that serves company 401(k) plan sponsors and third-party administrators and supports company stock option plans. The Schwab Institutional segment provides custodial, trading, and support
services to independent investment advisors.

The accounting policies of the
segments are the same as those described in note “2

–

Significant Accounting Policies.” Financial information for the Company’s reportable segments is presented in the following table. For the computation of its segment
information, the Company utilizes an activity-based costing model to allocate traditional income statement line item expenses (e.g., compensation and benefits, depreciation, and professional services) to the business activities driving segment
expenses (e.g., client service, opening new accounts, or business development) and a funds transfer pricing methodology to allocate certain revenues.

The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre-tax basis excluding items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, discontinued operations, and
extraordinary items. Segment assets are not disclosed because the balances are not used for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. However, capital expenditures are used in evaluating segment performance
and are therefore disclosed. Intersegment revenues, defined as revenues from transactions with other segments within the Company, are not material and are therefore not disclosed. Capital expenditures are reported gross, as opposed to net of
proceeds from the sale of fixed assets.

Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of The Charles Schwab Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (the Company), is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company’s
internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of and effected by the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of published financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As of December 31, 2006, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the
framework established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management has determined that the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2006.

The
Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets; provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that
could have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in
their report appearing on the following page.

- 78 -


Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of The
Charles Schwab Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheets of The Charles Schwab Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule of the Company on page F-2. We also have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control
Over Financial Reporting, that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and financial statement schedule, an opinion on management’s assessment, and an opinion on
the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of financial statements included examining, on a test basis,
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. Our audit of internal
control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal
financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal
control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein. Also, in our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Furthermore, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control – Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.
