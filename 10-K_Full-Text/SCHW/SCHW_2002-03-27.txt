                                     PART I


Item 1.       Business

(a) General Development of Business

     The Charles Schwab Corporation (CSC, and with its subsidiaries collectively

subsidiaries,  in securities  brokerage and related financial services.  Charles
Schwab  &  Co.,  Inc.  (Schwab)  is  a  securities   broker-dealer,   which  was
incorporated in 1971, and entered the discount  brokerage business in 1974. U.S.

Inc. (CSIM), Schwab Capital Markets L.P. (SCM), CyberTrader,  Inc. (CyberTrader,
formerly known as CyBerCorp,  Inc.), The Charles Schwab Trust Company (CSTC) and

proprietary  mutual funds. The Company refers to certain funds for which CSIM is
the investment  advisor as the  SchwabFunds(R).  SCM is a market maker in Nasdaq
and  other   securities   providing  trade  execution   services   primarily  to
broker-dealers and institutional clients.  CyberTrader, a subsidiary acquired in
March 2000, is an electronic  trading  technology  and brokerage  firm providing
services to highly active, online investors. CSTC serves as trustee for employee
benefit  plans,   primarily  401(k)  plans.  CSE,  CSC's  primary  international
subsidiary, is a retail securities brokerage firm located in the United Kingdom.

(b) Financial Information About Segments

     The  Company  provides  financial  services to  individuals,  institutional
clients  and  broker-dealers   through  four  segments  -  Individual  Investor,
Institutional Investor, Capital Markets, and U.S. Trust. The Individual Investor
segment includes the Company's domestic and international retail operations. The
Institutional Investor segment provides custodial, trading, and support services
to  independent  investment  managers,  serves  company 401(k) plan sponsors and
third-party  administrators,  and supports  company stock option plans and stock
purchase programs. The Capital Markets segment provides trade execution services
in Nasdaq,  exchange-listed  and other securities  primarily to  broker-dealers,
including  Schwab,  and institutional  clients.  The U.S. Trust segment provides
investment  and wealth  management,  fiduciary  services,  and  private  banking
services to individual and institutional  clients. For financial  information by

to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements in the  Company's  2001 Annual Report to
Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of
this report.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

                                Business Strategy

     The  Company's  overall  strategy is to attract and retain client assets by
focusing on a number of areas within the  financial  services  industry - retail
brokerage,  investment  and  wealth  management,   fiduciary  services,  support
services for independent investment managers, 401(k) defined contribution plans,
investment  services  to  companies  and  their  employees,   equity  securities
market-making,  and banking and other financial services.  The Company,  through
its subsidiaries, serves 7.8 million active client accounts(a). Client assets in
these accounts totaled $845.9 billion at December 31, 2001.
     To pursue its strategy and its  objective of long-term  profitable  growth,
the Company plans to leverage its  competitive  advantages,  which include:
o a broad  range of  products,  services,  and  advice  offerings,
o multi-channel delivery  systems,
o an ongoing  investment  in  technology,  and
o nationally recognized brands.
     Management  continues to believe that the key to  sustaining  the Company's
competitive  advantages  will be its ability to combine people and technology in
ways that provide investors with the access,  information,  guidance, advice and
control they expect - as well as high quality service - all at a lower cost than
traditional providers of financial services.
     The Company's  products and services are designed to meet clients'  varying
investment  and  financial  needs,  including  help and  advice  and  access  to
extensive  investment  research,  news and  information.  The  Company  seeks to
provide clients with customized  advice which is objective,  uncomplicated,  and
not driven by commission. The Company's approach to advice is based on long-term
investment  strategies  and  guidance  on  portfolio  diversification  and asset
allocation.  This  approach is built on  fact-based  research,  with the goal of
improving clients' ability to achieve better investment outcomes.
     Schwab strives to demystify investing by educating and assisting clients in
the  development  of investment  plans.  This approach is designed to be offered
consistently  across all of Schwab's delivery channels and provides clients with
a wide

                                     - 1 -

selection  of choices for their  investment  needs.  Schwab's  products,
services,  and advice  offerings  cross the  spectrum of its clients - those who
manage their own investments and make independent  investment  decisions,  those
who  want  ongoing  access  to  guidance  while  retaining  control  over  their
investment  decisions,  and those who desire to have  experienced  professionals
manage their assets.
     In 2001, the Company focused on aligning its  infrastructure  and resources
with its current strategic priorities, which include:
o providing the spectrum of affluent investors with  the  advice, relationships,
  and choices that support their desired investment outcomes;
o delivering the information, technology, service,  and pricing needed to remain
  a leader in serving active traders;
o providing   individual   investing   services   through  employers,  including
  retirement and option plans as well as personal brokerage accounts;
o offering selected banking services and  developing  investment  products  that
  give clients greater control and understanding of their finances;
o retaining a strong capital markets business to address investors' financial
  product and trade execution needs; and
o continuing  to provide high quality service to clients with smaller investment
  portfolios.

Condition - Description  of Business - Business  Strategy" in the Company's 2001
Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is  incorporated  herein by reference to
Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.
     The table below shows the  Company's  sources of revenues on a  comparative
basis for the three years ended December 31, 2001.

                    Products, Services, and Advice Offerings

     The  Company  offers  a broad  range  of  products,  services,  and  advice
offerings to address its clients' varying  investment and financial needs.  Such
offerings  are made through the Company's  four segments - Individual  Investor,
Institutional Investor, Capital Markets and U.S. Trust.

Individual Investors

     Investors at Schwab,  through the Individual Investor segment or indirectly
through  the  Institutional  Investor  segment,  have  access  to the  accounts,
features, tools, services, and products described below.

     Accounts and Features.  Through various types of brokerage accounts, Schwab
     ----------------------
offers the purchase and sale of securities which include Nasdaq, exchange-listed
and other equity  securities,  options,  mutual funds,  unit investment  trusts,
variable  annuities and fixed income  investments,  including  U.S.  Treasuries,
zero-coupon  bonds,   exchange-listed  and  over-the-counter   corporate  bonds,
municipal  bonds,   Government  National  Mortgage  Association  securities  and
certificates  of deposit.  Schwab also offers certain of its

                                     - 3 -

clients initial and secondary public stock offerings,  debt  underwritings,  and
access to futures and commodities trading. Additionally, Schwab provides clients
access to a variety of life insurance and annuity products  through  third-party
insurance companies.
     Clients approved for margin  transactions may borrow a portion of the price
of certain  securities  purchased  through Schwab, or may sell securities short.
Clients must have specific  approval to trade options;  as of December 31, 2001,
393,000 accounts had such approval. To write uncovered options,  clients must go
through an additional approval process and must maintain a significantly  higher
level of equity in their brokerage accounts.
     Because  Schwab  does not pay  interest on cash  balances  in its  standard
Schwab  brokerage  accounts,  it  provides  clients  with an option to have cash
balances in their accounts  automatically swept, on a weekly basis, into certain
taxable or  state-specific  municipal  tax-exempt  SchwabFunds(R)  money  market
funds.
     A client may receive  additional  services by qualifying  for and opening a
Schwab One(R) brokerage  account.  A client may access available funds in his or
her Schwab One account  either with a personal  check,  a VISA(R) debit card, or
Schwab BillPay(R),  in addition to the Schwab MoneyLink(R)  service offered with
all brokerage accounts. When a Schwab One client is approved for margin trading,
the checks and debit card also provide access to margin cash available. For cash
balances  awaiting  investment,  Schwab  pays  interest  to Schwab One  clients.
Alternatively, qualifying Schwab One clients seeking tax-exempt income may elect
to have cash  balances  swept  daily into  state-specific  municipal  tax-exempt
SchwabFunds money market funds.
     For  affluent  clients who meet  certain  trading or asset  levels,  Schwab
offers  additional  benefits such as free research,  priority  handling of their
service calls, access to independent  investment  managers,  and other services.
Additionally,  Schwab offers the Schwab Access(TM) account to these clients. The
Schwab Access account is an account allowing clients to conduct everyday payment
activities  at Schwab via the  Internet.  The  Schwab  Access  account  features
include  online bill payment,  unlimited  check  writing,  Gold VISA debit card,
returned check copies,  unlimited money transfers  within Schwab  accounts,  and
no-fee ATM access. Cash balances in a Schwab Access account are swept daily into
a SchwabFunds money market fund.
     During 2001,  Schwab  launched  Schwab  Private  Client (SPC) services on a
limited  basis to affluent  investors.  SPC services are designed for  investors
with at least $500,000 in assets at Schwab and feature a one-on-one relationship
with a Schwab investment  consultant backed by a team of professionals.  The SPC
account  is  structured   with  an  asset-based   fee  and  includes   portfolio
construction guidance, ongoing monitoring and commission-free equity trades.
     Schwab acts as  custodian,  as well as broker,  for  Individual  Retirement
Accounts  (IRAs) and Keogh  accounts.  In Schwab IRAs,  cash  balances are swept
daily into one of three  SchwabFunds  money market  funds.  During 2001,  Schwab
enhanced its IRA-related  services through the introduction of Personal Rollover
Assistant,  a service designed to help clients  streamline and consolidate their
retirement  investments.  Active IRAs and Keogh  accounts  at December  31, 2001
totaled 3,300,000, up 5% from December 31, 2000, while client assets in all IRAs
and Keogh accounts increased 9% to $201.9 billion.
     For active  traders,  Schwab offers accounts that include access to special
features and  services  such as advanced  trading  tools,  priority  access to a
dedicated  team of trading  specialists,  and reduced  pricing on equity trades.
CyberTrader  also offers a brokerage  account to its  clients.  Features of this
account include access to CyberTrader's proprietary software designed to benefit
highly  active  traders and the choice of manual or automated  order routing for
placing trades.

     Help and Advice,  Investment Education,  Research,  and Analysis Tools. The
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Company's  approach to advice is based on long-term  investment  strategies  and
guidance  on  portfolio  diversification  and  asset  allocation.  For  affluent
investors  who  make  independent  investment  decisions,   the  Company  offers
research,  analytic tools, and access to fee-based  portfolio  consultations and
financial planning  services.  Clients looking for more guidance while retaining
control  have access to advanced  research,  trading,  and  planning  resources,
combined with professional advice from Schwab's investment  specialists designed
to assist in developing an investment  strategy and carrying out  investment and
portfolio  management  decisions.  Additionally,  SPC provides higher  net-worth
clients  with  more  personalized,  one-on-one  advice  interactions,  access to
expanded  financial  planning,  asset  management  capabilities,   and  enhanced
performance reporting.  Schwab also established its MarketPlace, an internal Web
site which includes the  AdviceSuite,  a software  platform that enables service
representatives  to apply a consistent  set of  principles  and  practices  when
providing  market  viewpoints and investment  advice.  MarketPlace also provides
tools to support  discussions  with clients about events such as retirement  and
college  planning and charitable  giving.  Schwab's new Mutual Fund internal Web
site provides service  representatives with news,  research,  and analytic tools
designed to support their fund-related advice interactions with clients.  Schwab
has also  expanded  its advice  offering to affluent  clients by adding  Goldman
Sachs  research as well as Schwab's  proprietary  rating  system for  individual
equities.
     Schwab's   registered   representatives  can  refer  investors  who  desire
additional  guidance to independent  investment managers and certified financial
planners  through  the  Schwab  AdvisorSource(R)  program.  Schwab  clients  and
potential clients who desire personalized wealth management services can receive
referrals to U.S.  Trust's  investment  management,

trust, and private banking  capabilities as part of the Schwab  AdvisorSource(R)
program.
     Schwab strives to demystify investing by educating and assisting clients in
the development of investment plans.  Educational tools include :  WebShop(R), a
series of workshops  designed to help  investors  increase their skills in using
Schwab's online services;  the Schwab Learning  Center(R),  interactive  courses
designed to help clients learn more about  investing  principles  and use of the
online channel; the Smart Investor(TM), a centralized location on Schwab.com(TM)
for educational  information  about  investing;  and  SchwabWelcome.com(TM),  an
efficient and easy way for prospects to get started investing at Schwab.  During
2001,  Schwab continued to meet ongoing client demand for Schwab-style  help and
advice by  introducing  the Live  Online  program,  a series of  workshops  that
utilize the Internet to bring  Schwab  representatives  and clients  together to
discuss  investing  strategies,  retirement  planning and wealth management in a
highly interactive format.
     Schwab provides  various  Internet-based  research and analysis tools which
are designed to help clients achieve better investment outcomes,  including: the
Positions  Monitor,  which  tracks  clients'  mutual  fund and equity  holdings'
historical performance;  the Mutual Fund Performance  Profile(TM),  which allows
clients to analyze the  performance of their entire mutual fund  portfolio;  the
Schwab Portfolio  Checkup(R),  an asset allocation tool that also allows clients

investors seeking  ideas,  Schwab  provides  the  Stock  Screener,  which allows
clients to search over 9,000 equities  using their own criteria,  and the Schwab

investors  desiring to analyze a specific equity  security,  Schwab provides the
Charles Schwab Stock  Analyzer(R),  which provides data for the specific  equity
security and helps clients interpret such data. During 2001, Schwab expanded its
research and analysis tools to include  OptionStreet(TM),  which offers improved

qualified representatives on all of these advanced trading platforms.

     Client Financing and Clearing Services.  Clients'  securities  transactions
     ---------------------------------------
are  conducted  on either a cash or margin  basis.  Generally,  a client  buying
securities  in a cash-only  brokerage  account is  required  to make  payment by
settlement  date,  usually  three  business  days  after the trade is  executed.
However,  for purchases of certain types of  securities,  such as certain mutual
fund  shares,  a client must have a cash or money  market fund balance in his or
her account  sufficient  to pay for the trade prior to  execution.  When selling
securities,  a client is required to deliver the securities,  and is entitled to
receive the proceeds,  on settlement  date. In an account  authorized for margin
trading,  Schwab  may lend a client a portion  of the  market  value of  certain
securities up to the limit  established by the Federal Reserve Board,  which for
most equity  securities is initially 50%. These loans are  collateralized by the
securities in the client's account. Short sales of securities represent sales of
borrowed  securities  and create an  obligation  for the client to purchase  the
securities  at a later  date.  Clients  may  sell  securities  short in a margin
account  subject to minimum equity and applicable  margin  requirements  and the
availability of such securities to be borrowed and delivered. Interest on margin
loans to clients provides an important source of revenue to Schwab. During 2001,
Schwab's  outstanding  margin loans to clients  averaged  $11.4 billion and were
$9.2 billion at December 31, 2001.
     In permitting a client to engage in transactions,  Schwab faces credit risk
if the  client  fails to meet his or her

                                     - 5 -

obligations  in the  event  of  adverse  changes  in  the  market  value  of the
securities  positions  in  his  or  her  account.  Under  applicable  rules  and
regulations  for margin  transactions,  Schwab,  in the event of such an adverse
change,  requires the client to deposit  additional  securities or cash, so that
the amount of the client's obligation is not greater than specified  percentages
of the cash and market values of the  securities in the account.  As a matter of
policy,  Schwab generally requires its clients to maintain higher percentages of
collateral values than the minimum percentages required under these regulations.
     Schwab may use cash balances in client  accounts to extend margin credit to
other clients.  Pursuant to the requirements of Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Rule  15c3-3),  the portion of such cash balances not used
to extend margin credit (increased or decreased by certain other  client-related
balances) must be held in segregated investment accounts.  The balances in these
segregated investment accounts must be invested in cash or qualified securities,
as defined by Rule 15c3-3.  To the extent  Schwab's  clients  elect to have cash
balances in their  brokerage  accounts swept into certain  SchwabFunds(R)  money
market  funds,  the cash  balances  available to Schwab for  investments  or for
financing  margin loans are reduced.  However,  Schwab receives asset management
and  administration  fees from such funds  based  upon  average  daily  invested
balances.  See  also  "Management's   Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Results  of
Operations  and Financial  Condition - Risk  Management"  in the Company's  2001
Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is  incorporated  herein by reference to
Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report, and "Regulation" in this report.
     Schwab performs  clearing  services for all securities  transactions in its
client accounts.  Schwab clears the vast majority of client transactions through
the facilities of the National  Securities  Clearing  Corporation or the Options
Clearing   Corporation.   Certain  other  transactions,   such  as  mutual  fund
transactions and transactions in securities not eligible for settlement  through
a clearing  corporation,  are settled  directly  with the mutual  funds or other
financial institutions. Schwab is obligated to settle transactions with clearing
corporations,  mutual funds and other  financial  institutions  even if Schwab's
client  fails  to meet  his or her  obligations  to  Schwab.  In  addition,  for
transactions that do not settle through a clearing  corporation,  Schwab assumes
the risk of the other  party's  failure  to  settle  the  trade.  See note "22 -
Financial  Instruments Subject to Off-Balance-Sheet  Risk or Credit Risk" in the
Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements in the Company's 2001 Annual Report
to Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1
of this report.

     Mutual Funds. The Company provides mutual fund services  primarily  through
     -------------
the Individual Investor and Institutional Investor segments, as well as the U.S.
Trust segment.  Schwab's Mutual Fund  Marketplace(R)  provides  clients with the
ability to invest in over 2,000 mutual funds from 331 fund families.  Within the
Mutual Fund  Marketplace,  Schwab's  Mutual Fund  OneSource(R)  service  enables
clients to trade 1,079 mutual  funds from 240 fund  families  without  incurring
transaction fees. The Mutual Fund Marketplace also includes Schwab's mutual fund
clearing  service,  which provides mutual fund trading and clearing  services to
banks and broker-dealers.
     Schwab's Mutual Fund OneSource  service allows investors to access multiple
mutual fund companies,  avoid brokerage transaction fees, and achieve investment
diversity  among  fund  families.  In  addition,  investors'  recordkeeping  and
investment  monitoring are simplified through one consolidated  statement.  Fees
received  by  Schwab  for  providing  services,   including   recordkeeping  and
shareholder services,  from the Mutual Fund OneSource program are based upon the
daily  balances of client  assets  invested in the  participating  funds through
Schwab and are paid by the funds and/or fund sponsors.
     Schwab charges a transaction  fee on trades placed in the funds included in
the Mutual Fund Marketplace  (except on trades through the Mutual Fund OneSource
service).  These fees are recorded as  commission  revenues.  In addition to the
third-party funds available through the Mutual Fund Marketplace, Schwab offers a
family of proprietary funds,  referred to as the SchwabFunds(R),  and U.S. Trust
offers the Excelsior(R) family of funds.
     SchwabFunds  include  money market funds,  equity index funds,  bond funds,
asset allocation  funds,  funds that primarily  invest in stock,  bond and money
market funds, and actively-managed  equity funds.  Qualifying Schwab clients may
elect to have cash balances in their brokerage accounts  automatically  invested
in  certain   SchwabFunds   money  market   funds.   Excelsior   funds   include
actively-managed  domestic  equity funds,  international  equity funds,  taxable
fixed income funds,  tax-exempt fixed income funds and money market funds.  Fees
received  by the Company  from the  SchwabFunds  and the  Excelsior  funds,  for
providing shareholder services, administration,  investment management and other
services, are based upon the net assets of the funds.

     International.  The Company's  international  business  serves both foreign
     --------------
investors and  non-English-speaking  U.S. clients. The Company has a presence in
the United Kingdom,  Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands, and Brazil. In the U.S., the
Company serves Chinese-,  Korean-,  Vietnamese-,  and  Spanish-speaking  clients
through a combination of designated  branch offices and Web-based and telephonic
services. As of December 31, 2001, client assets in the Company's  international
business  totaled $22.7  billion.  During 2001, in light of slower than expected
progress

                                     - 6 -

towards the financial  objectives of its  foreign-based  operations,  as well as
difficult  securities  market  conditions  worldwide,  the Company  withdrew its
operations from Australia and Japan.  Additionally,  during the first quarter of
2002,  the Company  sold its  Canadian  business.  Moving  forward,  the Company
expects  that its  primary  international  focus will be growing  its  remaining
operations  in the Americas,  Asia and the U.K., as well as serving  clients who
live  abroad but want to invest in  U.S.-dollar-based  securities.  The  Company
believes this strategy  will leverage its existing  strengths in technology  and
U.S.-dollar-based trading.

Institutional Investors

     Services for Independent  Investment  Managers.  Schwab provides custodial,
     -----------------------------------------------
trading,  technology,  and other  support  services  to  independent  investment
managers, whose services are integral to the Company's advice offerings, through
the Institutional  Investor segment.  To attract the business of these managers,
Schwab has a  dedicated  business  unit which  includes  experienced  registered
representatives assigned to individual managers. Independent investment managers
participating  in this program who custody client accounts at Schwab may use the
SchwabLink(R) for Windows(R) product, the Schwab  Institutional(R) Web site, and
the Managed Account Connection(R) service, and  their clients can use the Schwab
Signature Services Alliance(TM)  program.  SchwabLink for Windows, a proprietary
software,  provides  independent  investment  managers  with  up-to-date  client
account  information,  as  well  as  mutual  fund  trading  and  management  fee
capabilities.  The  Schwab  Institutional  Web  site is the  core  platform  for
independent investment managers to conduct daily business activities online with
Schwab, including trading,  submitting client account information and retrieving
news and market  information.  The Managed  Account  Connection  service enables
independent  investment  managers to provide  their  clients  with  personalized
equity portfolio  management by a variety of institutional  asset managers.  The
Signature Services Alliance provides enhanced  personalized  services to clients
of  independent  investment  managers,  including  access to a dedicated team of
representatives  and the Schwab Alliance Web site.  During 2001, Schwab launched
several new services to help  independent  investment  managers manage and build
their practices,  including the Electronic  Account  Submission  service,  which
allows independent  investment  managers to establish new client account numbers
immediately  upon request,  and the Managed Account  Select(TM)  service,  which
enables  independent  investment  managers  to provide  clients  with  access to
pre-screened money managers under a simplified single-fee structure. At December
31, 2001,  Schwab client assets held in accounts managed by approximately  5,800
active independent investment managers totaled $235.0 billion.

     Corporate  Services.  The Company  also serves  individuals  through  their
     --------------------
workplace in a variety of ways. The Company  provides 401(k)  recordkeeping  and
other retirement plan services directly through a dedicated sales force, as well
as indirectly through alliances with third-party  administrators.  In the direct
channel,  SchwabPlan(R),  the Company's  primary 401(k) retirement plan product,
offers plan sponsors a wide array of investment options,  participant  education
and servicing, trustee services and participant-level recordkeeping.  SchwabPlan
features  include an  electronic  desktop  delivery  service  that  allows  plan
participants to receive detailed account information via encrypted e-mail, and a
Web site that allows individuals who are using Schwab's retirement plan services
through  third-party  administrators  to utilize the  education,  planning,  and
investment  tools that are available to SchwabPlan  participants.  In 2001,  the
Company  launched a bundled 401(k) plan designed  specifically to meet the needs
of 401(k)  programs  with as little as $2 million to $20 million in  participant
assets.  Additionally,  the Company  offers stock option  plan,  stock  purchase
program, and restricted stock services to companies,  as well as trade execution
and education  services to their employees.  These services include online tools
such as the  Schwab  OptionCenter  (R),  which  allows  access  to stock  option
accounts where  employees can research,  model and exercise  their options,  and
StockPlanCenter(R), which allows access to employee stock purchase plan accounts
where   employees   can   sell   shares.   During   2001,   client   assets   in
employer-sponsored retirement plans declined 3% to $97.1 billion, which included
$31.5 billion serviced by Schwab's retirement plan services business.

Capital Markets

     The Company  provides  its clients with quick and  efficient  access to the
securities markets through its market maker, SCM, and specialist operations. SCM
provides  trade  execution  services  in  Nasdaq,  exchange-listed,   and  other
securities  primarily to  broker-dealers,  including  Schwab,  and institutional
clients. As a market maker in Nasdaq, exchange-listed, and other securities, SCM
generally  executes client trades as principal.  While  substantially all Nasdaq
security  trades  originated  by the  clients of Schwab are  directed  to SCM, a
substantial  portion  of SCM's  trading  volume  comes from  parties  other than
Schwab. During 2001, SCM expanded its automated order execution capabilities and
established a securities market-making joint venture in the United Kingdom.
     Schwab has  specialist  operations  on the Boston  Stock  Exchange  to make
markets in exchange-listed  securities. The majority of trades originated by the
clients of Schwab in exchange-listed  securities for which Schwab makes a market
are  directed  to  this  operation.  At  December  31,  2001,  Schwab

                                     - 7 -

had four  specialists  on the Boston  Stock  Exchange  that made  markets in 224
securities.
     Additionally,  the  Company  offers its  clients  access to  extended-hours
trading for certain Nasdaq,  exchange-listed,  and other securities  through its
participation  in the REDIBook ECN LLC (REDIBook),  an electronic  communication
network.  The merger of REDIBook and  Archipelago  ECN LLC was announced in 2001
and closed in the first quarter of 2002.
     Clients  also have the  ability  to  analyze  and trade a variety  of fixed
income  securities  through Schwab's  multi-channel  delivery  systems.  Through
Schwab's alliance with Valubond,  individual and independent  investment manager
clients can analyze and trade  fixed  income  securities  through the Schwab Web
site.  During 2001,  Schwab  expanded its fixed income  offering by  introducing
Schwab  CDSource(TM),  a service that  enables  clients to research and purchase
certificates of deposits from a variety of FDIC-insured depository institutions,
including U.S. Trust, entirely online.
     See also "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and
Financial  Condition - Risk  Management"  in the Company's 2001 Annual Report to
Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of
this report, and "Regulation" in this report.

U.S. Trust

     U.S. Trust provides an array of financial services for affluent clients and
their families. These services include investment and wealth management,  trust,
financial and estate  planning,  and private banking,  which includes  mortgage,
personal  lending and deposit  products.  U.S. Trust provides both  individually
managed  balanced  accounts and specialized  investment  management  services to
clients  with $2 million  to $50  million in assets at U.S.  Trust.  U.S.  Trust
offers Wealth Advisory  Accounts,  an investment  advisory service that utilizes
the  Excelsior(R)  family of mutual funds, to clients that have over $250,000 in
assets at U.S. Trust. In addition to investment management services,  U.S. Trust
provides specialized fiduciary, financial planning, enhanced master custody, and
philanthropic  consulting  services  to  clients  that have over $50  million in
assets at U.S. Trust.  U.S. Trust also offers private banking services to assist
in meeting the credit and liquidity  requirements of its clients. These services
include mortgage and personal  lending  vehicles and an array of  deposit-taking
products. Additionally, higher net worth investors can receive referrals to U.S.
Trust as part of Schwab  AdvisorSource(R).  In 2001,  U.S.  Trust  introduced an
enhanced  Web site which  provides  clients with secure  access to  consolidated
account information as well as updated equity pricing, proprietary research, and
financial information from third-party providers.
     For institutional clients, including corporations, endowments, foundations,
and pension plans, U.S. Trust provides  investment  management,  brokerage,  and
special fiduciary services.  Through these investment management services,  U.S.
Trust  offers  a wide  range  of  investment  options,  including  balanced  and
specialized   domestic  and   international   equity   investments,   structured
investments,  alternative investments,  fixed income securities,  and short-term
cash management. Institutional clients can also utilize the Excelsior funds.
     Additionally,  U.S. Trust offers to its institutional  clients  investment,
consulting and fiduciary services for employee stock ownership plans that invest
in  significant  amounts of employer  stock.  Special  fiduciary  services  also
include trustee  services for  non-qualified  or supplemental  employee  benefit
plans, also known as rabbi trusts.

                         Multi-Channel Delivery Systems

     The Company's  multi-channel  delivery  systems allow clients to choose how
they prefer to do business  with the Company.  In addition to its branch  office
network, Schwab maintains five regional client telephone service centers as well
as automated telephonic and online channels,  primarily serving retail investors
through the Individual Investor and Institutional Investor segments.  U.S. Trust
maintains offices serving clients through the U.S. Trust segment.

Office Network

     To  enable   clients  to  obtain   services   in  person   with  a  Company
representative,  the Company  maintains a network of  offices.  At December  31,
2001,  Schwab  operated 395  domestic  branch  offices in 48 states,  as well as
branches in the  Commonwealth  of Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin  Islands.  At
December 31, 2001, U.S. Trust operated 34 offices in 12 states. In addition, the
Company  has  offices in Brazil,  the Cayman  Islands,  Hong Kong and the United
Kingdom. The Company's office network plays a key role in building its business.
With the client service support of regional client telephone service centers and
automated  telephonic and online channels,  office personnel focus a significant
portion of their time on business  development and help and advice  interactions
with clients. Clients can use Schwab's branch offices to open accounts,  deliver
and receive checks and securities, obtain market information,  place orders, and
obtain  related  client  services in person,  yet most of these  activities  are
conducted by telephone, mail, and online channels.  Schwab's branch offices also
provide  investors  with  access  to the  Internet  and to  Schwab's  registered
representatives   who  can  assist  investors  in  developing  asset  allocation
strategies and evaluating  their  investment  choices.  U.S. Trust's clients can
meet with wealth  management  professionals at regional offices to obtain access
to U.S. Trust's wide array of financial services and products.

                                     - 8 -

Regional Client Telephone Service Centers

     Schwab's five regional client telephone service centers, located in Austin,
Denver,  Indianapolis,  Orlando, and Phoenix,  handle client trading and service
calls  twenty-four  hours a day,  seven days a week. The capacity of the service
centers allows branch office personnel to focus on business development and help
and advice interactions with clients.
     Schwab's  client  service  approach  is to  use  teams  led  by  registered
representatives  in the service  centers,  who work closely with office  network
personnel.  Additionally,  certain  teams at these centers  provide  specialized
services to affluent clients.  Further,  Schwab's approach to advice is designed
to be  offered  consistently  across all of  Schwab's  delivery  channels.  Each
registered  representative  has  immediate  access  to the  client  account  and
market-related  information  necessary to respond to client inquiries.  For most
client orders,  registered  representatives  can enter the order and confirm the
transaction  immediately.  As a result  of this  approach,  the  departure  of a
registered  representative  generally  does not result in a loss of clients  for
Schwab.

Online and Automated Telephonic Channels

     Clients are able to obtain  financial  information and execute trades on an
automated basis through Schwab's automated telephonic and online channels. These
channels  are  designed to provide  added  convenience  for clients and minimize
Schwab's costs of responding to and processing routine client transactions.
     Schwab's  automated  telephonic  channels include  TeleBroker(R) - Schwab's
touch-tone  telephone  quote and  trading  service,  and Schwab by  Phone(TM)  -
Schwab's  voice  recognition  quote  and  trading  service.  Schwab's  automated
telephonic  channels  handled over 75% of client calls received in 2001.  Schwab
handled approximately 89 million automated and live calls received in 2001.
     Online  channels  include the Charles Schwab Web Site, an  information  and
trading service on the Internet at  schwab.com(TM);  the Schwab Institutional(R)
Web site,  a platform  for  independent  investment  managers  to conduct  daily
activities;  and  PocketBroker(TM),  a wireless information and trading service.
Additionally,   online  mediums  designed  for  highly  active  traders  include
StreetSmart  Pro(R) and  Velocity(TM),  online  trading  systems  which  provide
enhanced trade  information and order execution,  and  CyberTrader's  integrated
software-based  trading platforms.  While most client transactions are completed
through the online  channel,  the Company  continues to stress the importance of
Clicks  and  Mortar  access - blending  the  power of the Internet with personal
service  to  create a  full-service  client  experience.  The  Company's  online
channels  handled 80% of total trades in 2001.  Schwab's share of the industry's
online  assets was 37% at December 31, 2001.  Schwab's  share of the  industry's
online trades was 22% in 2001.

                                   Technology

     The  Company's  ongoing  investment  in  technology  is a  key  element  in
expanding its product and service  offerings,  enhancing  its delivery  systems,
providing fast and consistent  client service,  reducing  processing  costs, and
facilitating  the Company's  ability to handle  significant  increases in client
activity  without a  corresponding  rise in staffing  levels.  The Company  uses
technology  to empower its clients to manage  their  financial  affairs and is a
leader in driving technological advancements in the financial services industry.
     The Company's  operations  rely heavily on its  information  processing and
communications  systems.  The  Company's  system  for  processing  a  securities
transaction is highly automated. Registered representatives equipped with online
computer  terminals can access client  account  information,  obtain  securities
prices and related information, and enter orders online.
     To  support  its  multi-channel   delivery   systems,   as  well  as  other
applications such as clearing functions, account administration,  recordkeeping,
and direct  client  access to investment  information,  the Company  maintains a
sophisticated computer network connecting all of the offices and regional client
telephone service centers.  The Company's computers are also linked to the major
registered  U.S.   securities   markets,   the  National   Securities   Clearing
Corporation, and The Depository Trust Company.
     Failure of the Company's information  processing or communications  systems
for a significant  period of time could limit the  Company's  ability to process
its large volume of  transactions  accurately and rapidly.  This could cause the
Company to be unable to satisfy its obligations to clients and other  securities
firms, and could result in regulatory  violations.  External events,  such as an
earthquake or power failure, loss of external information feeds such as security
price  information,  as well as internal  malfunctions  such as those that could
occur during the  implementation of system  modifications,  could render part or
all of such systems inoperative.
     To enhance the reliability of the system and integrity of data, the Company
maintains backup and recovery  functions.  These include logging of all critical
files  intraday,  duplication  and storage of all  critical  data outside of its
central computer site every twenty-four hours, and maintenance of facilities for
backup and  communications.  They also  include  the  maintenance  and  periodic
testing of a disaster  recovery plan that  management  believes would permit the
Company to recommence essential computer operations if its central computer site
were to become inaccessible. To minimize business interruptions, the Company has
data  centers  intended,  in part,  to further  improve the recovery of business
processing in the event of an emergency.

                          Nationally Recognized Brands

     The Company's  advertising and marketing  programs  support its strategy by
continually   reinforcing   the  strengths   and  key   attributes  of  Schwab's
full-service   offering,   U.S.   Trust's  wealth   management   services,   and
CyberTrader's   trading  technology.   By  maintaining  a  consistent  level  of
visibility  in the  marketplace,  the Company  seeks to establish  Schwab,  U.S.
Trust,  and  CyberTrader as leading  financial  services brands in a focused and
cost-effective  manner.  The Company  primarily  uses a combination  of network,
cable  and  local  television,   print  media,   direct  mail,   athletic  event
sponsorship, and online channels in its advertising.

                                    Employees

     As of December 31, 2001, the Company had full-time, part-time and temporary
employees,  and  persons  employed  on a  contract  basis that  represented  the
equivalent of 19,600 full-time employees.

                                 Risk Management

     The  Company's  business and  activities  expose it to  different  types of
risks.  Proper  identification,  assessment,  and  management of these risks are
essential  to  the  success  and  financial  soundness  of  the  Company.  For a
discussion  on the  Company's  principal  risks  and  some of the  policies  and
procedures for risk identification, assessment and mitigation, see "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial  Condition - Risk
Management"  in the  Company's  2001  Annual  Report to  Stockholders,  which is
incorporated  herein by  reference  to  Exhibit  No.  13.1 of this  report,  and
"Technology" and "Regulation" in this report.

                              Business Environment

     The Company's business, like that of other securities brokerage and related
financial services firms, is directly affected by the fluctuations in securities
trading volumes and price levels that occur in fundamentally  cyclical financial
markets,  as well as by changes in government  monetary policies that impact the
growth of bank loans and investments and the level of interest charged for loans
and paid on deposits  and other  funding  sources.  The  Company may  experience
significant variations in revenues from period to period depending on changes in
these factors and the overall business  environment.  The Company's  non-trading
revenues are less cyclical than its trading revenues, but would be impacted by a
sustained downturn in the securities  markets.  The Company adjusts its expenses
in anticipation of and in response to changes in financial market conditions and
client trading patterns.  Certain of the Company's expenses  (including variable
compensation,  portions of communications,  and commissions, clearance and floor
brokerage) vary directly with changes in financial performance or client trading
activity.  Expenses relating to the level of contractors,  temporary  employees,
overtime hours,  advertising and market development,  and professional  services
are  adjustable  over the short term to help the Company  achieve its  financial
objectives. Additionally, development spending, which includes media and project
spending,  is discretionary and can be altered in response to market conditions.
However,  a significant  portion of the Company's  expenses such as salaries and
wages,  occupancy and equipment,  and  depreciation and amortization do not vary
directly,  at  least  in the  short  term,  with  fluctuations  in  revenues  or
securities trading volumes.  Also, the Company views its development spending as
essential for future growth and therefore  prefers to avoid major adjustments in
such spending unless faced with a sustained  slowdown in revenue  growth.  Given
the prevailing market conditions and the Company's  financial  performance,  the
Company reduced its development  spending in 2001 to approximately $406 million,
down 23% from 2000.  Additionally in 2001, the Company initiated a restructuring
plan  to  reduce  operating   expenses.   For  a  discussion  of  the  Company's
restructuring  plan,  see  "Management's  Discussion  and Analysis of Results of
Operations and Financial Condition - Results of Operations - Financial Overview"
and note "3 -  Restructuring  and Other  Charges"  in the Notes to  Consolidated
Financial Statements in the Company's 2001 Annual Report to Stockholders,  which
is incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.

                                   Competition

     The Company faces significant competition from companies seeking to attract
client financial assets,  including  traditional,  discount and online brokerage
firms,  mutual fund companies,  banks,  asset management,  and wealth management
companies.  For a discussion of  competition  see  "Management's  Discussion and
Analysis of Results of  Operations  and  Financial  Condition - Risk  Management
- -Competition"  in the  Company's  2001 Annual Report to  Stockholders,  which is
incorporated herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of this report.

                                   Regulation

     CSC is a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company
subject to  supervision  and  regulation by the Federal  Reserve Board under the
Act. CSC's  depository  institution  subsidiaries  are subject to regulation and
supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state
law. For a discussion of bank holding  company  requirements  see  "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial  Condition - Bank
Holding Company Act Requirements" and note "20 - Regulatory Requirements" in the
Notes to Consolidated  Financial  Statements in the Company's 2001 Annual Report
to Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1
of this report.
     The  securities  industry  in the United  States is  subject  to  extensive
regulation  under both  federal  and state laws.  The  Securities  and  Exchange
Commission  (SEC) is the  federal  agency  charged  with  administration  of the
federal  securities  laws.  Schwab,  SCM,  and  CyberTrader  are  registered  as
broker-dealers  with the SEC.  Schwab  and CSIM  are  registered  as  investment
advisors  with the SEC.  Additionally,  Schwab is regulated  by the  Commodities
Futures  Trading  Commission  (CFTC) with respect to its introduced  futures and
commodities trading activities.
     Much  of  the   regulation  of   broker-dealers   has  been   delegated  to
self-regulatory   organizations,   principally   the  National   Association  of
Securities Dealers,  Inc. (NASD) and the national  securities  exchanges such as
the New York Stock  Exchange  (NYSE),  which has been  designated  by the SEC as
Schwab's primary regulator with respect to its securities  activities.  The NASD
has been  designated by the SEC as SCM's primary  regulator  with respect to its
securities  activities.  The  Chicago  Board  Options  Exchange  (CBOE) has been
designated as Schwab's  primary  regulator  with respect to its options  trading
activities for 2001. The National Futures  Association (NFA) has been designated
by the CFTC as  Schwab's  primary  regulator  with  respect to its  futures  and
commodities trading activities. These self-regulatory  organizations adopt rules
(subject to  approval by the SEC or CFTC)  governing  the  industry  and conduct
periodic  examinations of  broker-dealers.  Securities firms are also subject to
regulation  by state  securities  authorities  in the  states  in which  they do
business.  In addition to its membership in the NYSE, Schwab is also a member of
all other major U.S. securities  exchanges and is consequently  subject to their
rules and regulations. Schwab and SCM were registered as broker-dealers in fifty
states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico as of December 31, 2001.
     The principal purpose of regulations and discipline of  broker-dealers  and
investment  advisors is the  protection of clients and the  securities  markets,
rather than  protection  of creditors and  stockholders  of  broker-dealers  and
investment  advisors.  The  regulations to which  broker-dealers  and investment
advisors are subject  cover all aspects of the  securities  business,  including
sales methods,  trading practices among broker-dealers,  uses and safekeeping of
clients'  funds  and  securities,   capital   structure  of  securities   firms,
recordkeeping and reporting,  fee arrangements,  disclosure to clients,  and the
conduct of directors, officers and employees. As registered investment advisors,
Schwab and CSIM are subject to the  requirements of the Investment  Advisers Act
of 1940 and the  regulations  thereunder,  which  impose,  among  other  things,
various  recordkeeping,   reporting,  and  disclosure  requirements  and  impose
limitations  on fees and  principal  transactions  between  an  advisor  and its
clients.
     Additional  legislation,  changes in rules  promulgated  by the SEC,  other
federal and state regulatory authorities, and self-regulatory organizations,  or
changes in the  interpretation  or  enforcement  of existing  laws and rules may
directly affect the method of operation and profitability of broker-dealers  and
investment advisors. The profitability of broker-dealers and investment advisors
could also be affected by rules and  regulations  which  impact the business and
financial  communities  in  general,  including  changes  to the laws  governing
taxation,   antitrust  regulation,  and  electronic  commerce.  The  SEC,  CFTC,
self-regulatory  organizations,  and state  securities  authorities  may conduct
civil or administrative proceedings which can result in censure, fine, cease and
desist orders,  or suspension or expulsion of a  broker-dealer  or an investment
advisor,  its officers,  or  employees.  Schwab and SCM have been the subject of
such administrative proceedings.
     As registered  broker-dealers and NASD member  organizations,  Schwab, SCM,
and CyberTrader are required by federal law to belong to the Securities Investor
Protection  Corporation (SIPC), which provides,  in the event of the liquidation
of a  broker-dealer,  protection for securities  held in client accounts held by
the firm of up to $500,000 per client,  subject to a limitation  of $100,000 for
claims  of cash  balances.  SIPC is funded  through  assessments  on  registered
broker-dealers.  In addition,  Schwab  purchased  from a private  surety company
account  protection for clients above the SIPC limit,  as defined,  of up to the
net equity value for client securities and cash in each account.  Stocks, bonds,
mutual  funds,  options,  unit  investment  trusts,  and money  market funds are
considered  securities  for the purposes of SIPC  protection  and the additional
protection (i.e.,  protected securities may either be replaced or converted into
an equivalent market value as of the date a SIPC trustee is appointed).  Neither
SIPC  protection nor the additional  protection  applies to  fluctuations in the
market value of securities.
     Schwab  is  authorized  by the  Municipal  Securities  Rulemaking  Board to
conduct  transactions  in municipal  securities on behalf of its clients and has
obtained  certain  additional  registrations  with the SEC and state  regulatory
agencies necessary to permit it to engage in certain other activities incidental
to its brokerage business.

                                     - 11 -

     Margin  lending by Schwab  and SCM is  subject  to the margin  rules of the
Federal Reserve Board and the NYSE. Under such rules, broker-dealers are limited
in the amount they may lend in connection with certain purchases and short sales
of securities and are also required to impose certain  maintenance  requirements
on the amount of securities and cash held in margin accounts. In addition, those
rules and rules of the CBOE govern the amount of margin clients must provide and
maintain in writing uncovered options.
     As a California  state-chartered trust company, CSTC is primarily regulated
by the  State of  California  Department  of  Financial  Institutions.  Since it
provides  employee benefit plan trust services,  CSTC is also required to comply
with  the  Employee   Retirement  Income  Security  Act  of  1974  (ERISA)  and,
consequently,  is subject to oversight by both the Internal  Revenue Service and
Department  of Labor.  CSTC is required  under ERISA to maintain a fidelity bond
for the protection of employee benefit trusts for which it serves as trustee.
     The Company's  business is also subject to  regulation by various  non-U.S.
governments,  securities exchanges, and regulatory bodies, particularly in those
countries  where it has  acquired  subsidiaries.  Such  regulation  may directly
affect  the method of  operation  and  profitability  of the  Company's  foreign
operations.
     As  registered   broker-dealers,   certain  subsidiaries  of  the  Company,
including  Schwab and SCM,  are subject to the  Uniform  Net Capital  Rule (Rule
15c3-1) under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the Net Capital Rule), which
has also been adopted through  incorporation  by reference in NYSE Rule 325. The
CFTC and NFA also  impose net capital  requirements.  Schwab is a member firm of
the NYSE,  the NASD and the NFA,  and SCM is a member firm of the NASD.  The Net
Capital Rule  specifies  minimum net capital  requirements  that are intended to
ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers.  Failure
to  maintain  the  required  net capital  may  subject a firm to  suspension  or
expulsion  by the NYSE and the NASD,  certain  punitive  actions  by the SEC and
other  regulatory  bodies,  and  ultimately  may  require a firm's  liquidation.
Because CSC itself is not a registered  broker-dealer,  it is not subject to the
Net Capital Rule.  However, if Schwab or SCM failed to maintain specified levels
of net capital,  such failure  would  constitute a default by CSC under  certain
debt covenants.
     "Net   capital"  is   essentially   defined  as  net  worth  (assets  minus
liabilities),  plus qualifying subordinated borrowings,  less certain deductions
that result from excluding assets that are not readily convertible into cash and
from  conservatively  valuing  certain other assets.  These  deductions  include
charges  that  discount  the value of firm  security  positions  to reflect  the
possibility of adverse changes in market value prior to disposition.
     The Net Capital Rule requires  notice of equity  capital  withdrawals to be
provided to the SEC prior to and  subsequent to  withdrawals  exceeding  certain
sizes. Such rule prohibits  withdrawals that would reduce a broker-dealer's  net
capital to an amount less than 25% of its deductions required by the Net Capital
Rule as to its  security  positions.  The Net Capital  Rule also allows the SEC,
under limited circumstances, to restrict a broker-dealer from withdrawing equity
capital for up to twenty business days.
     Schwab and SCM have elected the  alternative  method of  calculation  under
paragraph  (a)(1)(ii) of the Net Capital Rule, which requires a broker-dealer to
maintain  minimum net capital equal to the greater of 2% of its "aggregate debit
items,"  computed in accordance  with the Formula for  Determination  of Reserve
Requirements for Brokers and Dealers (Rule 15c3-3 under the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934), or a minimum dollar amount, which is based on the type of business
conducted by the  broker-dealer.  The minimum  dollar amount for both Schwab and
SCM is $1 million.  "Aggregate debit items" are assets that have as their source
transactions with clients,  primarily margin loans. Under the alternative method
of the Net Capital Rule, a broker-dealer  may not (a) pay, or permit the payment
or  withdrawal  of, any  subordinated  borrowings  or (b) pay cash  dividends or
permit  equity  capital to be removed if, after giving  effect to such  payment,
withdrawal,  or removal,  its net capital would be less than 5% of its aggregate
debit items.
     Under NYSE Rule 326,  Schwab is required to reduce its  business if its net
capital  is less  than  4% of  aggregate  debit  items  for  more  than  fifteen
consecutive  business  days;  NYSE  Rule 326 also  prohibits  the  expansion  of
business if net capital is less than 5% of  aggregate  debit items for more than
fifteen  consecutive  business days. The provisions of NYSE Rule 326 also become
operative if capital withdrawals (including scheduled maturities of subordinated
borrowings  during the  following  six months)  would result in a reduction of a
firm's net capital to the levels indicated.
     If compliance  with  applicable net capital rules were to limit Schwab's or
SCM's  operations and their ability to repay  subordinated  debt to CSC, this in
turn could limit CSC's  ability to repay debt,  pay cash  dividends and purchase
shares of its outstanding stock. See also "Management's  Discussion and Analysis
of Results of  Operations  and  Financial  Condition  -  Liquidity  and  Capital
Resources - Liquidity" and note "20 - Regulatory  Requirements"  in the Notes to

Stockholders,  which is incorporated  herein by reference to Exhibit No. 13.1 of

================================================================================

     The decrease in net interest  revenue,  net of interest  expense,  from the
fourth  quarter of 2000 to the fourth quarter of 2001 was primarily due to lower
levels of, and lower rates  received  on,  margin  loans to  clients,  partially
offset by higher average balances of client-related  investments and lower rates
paid on brokerage client cash balances.

     On May 31, 2000,  CSC  completed  its merger (the  Merger) with U.S.  Trust
     Corporation  (USTC). The condensed financial  statements,  included in this
     Annual Report on Form 10-K, give  retroactive  effect to the Merger,  which
     was accounted for as a pooling of interests in the  consolidated  financial
     statements.  The pooling of  interests  method of  accounting  requires the
     restatement of all periods  presented as if CSC and USTC had been operating
     as a combined entity during such periods.

     return of  capital  of $82  million  from  Schwab  and a  non-cash  capital
     contribution of $82 million to USTC in connection with Schwab's purchase of

5.   Commitments

     During 2001, a subsidiary of CSC began  occupying and making lease payments
     on a newly  renovated  office  building.  The  lease for the  building  was
     arranged by working with a bank to create a special  purpose trust (Trust).
     The Trust,  through an agent, raised the $245 million needed to acquire and
     renovate the building by issuing  long-term debt ($235 million) and raising
     equity capital ($10 million).  The subsidiary's  lease payments,  which are
     guaranteed by CSC, to the Trust vary with  fluctuations  in interest  rates
     and are  structured  to cover the  interest on the debt  obligations  and a
     specified  return on the equity.  This financing  arrangement is known as a
     synthetic  lease.  CSC  has  provided  the  Trust  with  a  residual  value
     guarantee, which means that if the building is sold to a third party CSC is
     responsible for making up any shortfall  between the actual sales price and
     the $245 million funded by the Trust, up to a maximum of $202 million.  CSC
     has  recently  obtained a  preliminary  appraisal  of $200  million for the
     estimated value of the building at the end of the lease term. The shortfall
     in estimated value below $245 million will be recorded as expense using the
     straight-line method over the remaining term of the lease.
