TABLE OF
    CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1:

Business

Incorporated in 1967, Applied, a Delaware corporation, provides
    manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global
    semiconductor, flat panel display, solar photovoltaic (PV) and
    related industries. Applied’s customers include
    manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, flat panel
    liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar PV cells and modules, and
    other electronic devices. These customers may use what they
    manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other
    companies for use in advanced electronic components. The
    Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October.

Applied is the world’s largest semiconductor fabrication
    equipment supplier based on revenue, with the capability to
    provide global deployment and support services. Applied also is
    a leading supplier of LCD fabrication equipment to the flat
    panel display industry and is the leading supplier of solar PV
    manufacturing systems to the solar industry, based on revenue.

Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon Systems
    Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and
    Environmental Solutions. A summary of financial information for
    each reportable segment is found in Note 17 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that
    could affect Applied’s operations is set forth under
    “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, which is incorporated
    herein by reference.

Silicon
    Systems Group Segment

Applied’s Silicon Systems Group segment develops,
    manufactures and sells a wide range of manufacturing equipment
    used to fabricate semiconductor chips, also referred to as
    integrated circuits (ICs). Most chips are built on a silicon
    wafer base and include a variety of circuit components, such as
    transistors and other devices, that are connected by multiple
    layers of wiring (interconnects). Applied offers systems that
    perform most of the primary processes used in chip fabrication
    including atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor
    deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD),
    electrochemical deposition (ECD) etch, rapid thermal processing
    (RTP), chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), wet cleaning and
    wafer metrology and inspection, as well as systems that etch,
    measure and inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the
    photolithography process. Applied’s semiconductor
    manufacturing systems are used by integrated device
    manufacturers and foundries to build and package memory, logic
    and other types of chips.

Most chips currently are fabricated using 65 nanometer (nm) and
    larger linewidth dimensions, although Applied is also working
    with customers on leading-edge technology for advanced nodes
    using 45nm, 32nm and smaller dimensions. To build a chip, the
    transistors, capacitors and other circuit components are first
    created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of
    processes to deposit and selectively remove portions of
    successive film layers. Similar processes are then used to build
    the layers of wiring structures on the wafer. As the density of
    the circuit components increases to enable greater computing
    capability in the same or smaller physical area, the complexity
    of building the chip also increases, necessitating more process
    steps to form smaller structures and more intricate wiring
    schemes. A typical, simplified process sequence for building the
    wiring or interconnect portion of a chip involves initially
    depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of
    circuit components using a CVD system. An etch system is then
    used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer. To
    form the metal interconnects, these openings and patterns are
    subsequently filled with conducting material using PVD and ECD
    technologies. A CMP step then polishes the wafer to achieve a
    flat surface. Additional deposition, etch and CMP steps are then
    performed to build up the layers needed to complete the
    interconnection of the circuit elements. Advanced chip designs
    require more than 500 steps involving these and other processes
    to complete the manufacturing cycle.

While some device manufacturers are still using aluminum as the
    main conducting material for building interconnect structures,
    most have transitioned to copper. Copper has lower resistance
    than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller area.
    Applied is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing
    copper-based chips, including equipment for depositing, etching
    and planarizing copper interconnect layers. Complementing the
    transition to copper to improve chip speed is the use of low
    dielectric constant (low k) films to replace silicon



dioxide material as the insulator between the copper wiring
    structures. Applied also leads the industry in providing systems
    for depositing low k dielectric films.

The transistor is another key area of the chip where
    semiconductor manufacturers are improving their device designs
    to enhance speed. Applied has the industry’s largest
    portfolio of technically advanced products for building smaller
    and faster transistors. One method of enhancing chip performance
    is strain engineering, a technique that stretches or compresses
    the space between atoms, allowing electrical current to flow
    more quickly. Multiple strain films are typically used in
    advanced devices since they have an additive effect on
    increasing transistor speed. Applied has a comprehensive
    portfolio of systems to enable these applications using CVD and
    epitaxial deposition technologies.

Major chipmakers have announced that they will be integrating
    new high dielectric constant (high-k) and metal materials and
    processes in their transistor gate structures to increase chip
    performance and reduce power consumption. Applied has a
    comprehensive portfolio of fully characterized processes for
    building these

high-k/metal

gates. These solutions include an integrated dielectric gate
    stack tool that combines four critical processes in a single
    system, a portfolio of metallization technologies using ALD and
    PVD, and an innovative high temperature etch system.

As new consumer products demand higher performance in a smaller
    space, a new type of chip packaging is emerging, known as
    three-dimensional (3D) ICs. Providing greater functionality in a
    smaller footprint, 3DICs stack multiple chips together and
    electrically interconnect them using deep holes, called
    through-silicon via (TSV) structures. In fiscal 2010, Applied
    acquired Semitool, Inc., a leading supplier of ECD and wafer
    surface preparation equipment used by chip packaging companies.
    Applied now has the industry’s most comprehensive line of
    production-proven systems and processes required for the
    majority of advanced packaging manufacturing steps, including
    etch, CVD, PVD, ECD, wafer cleaning and CMP systems. Applied is
    leading efforts to enable the adoption of packaging technology,
    working with consortiums and other equipment suppliers to lower
    customers’ implementation costs.

Most of Applied’s semiconductor equipment products are
    single-wafer systems with multiple process chambers attached to
    a base platform. This enables each wafer to be processed
    separately in its own environment, allowing precise process
    control, while the system’s multiple chambers enable
    simultaneous, high productivity manufacturing. Applied sells
    most of its single-wafer, multi-chamber systems on four basic
    platforms: the
    Centura

®

,

    the
    Endura

®

,

    the
    Producer

®

and the
    Vantage

®

.

    These platforms support ALD, CVD, PVD, etch and RTP technologies.

Over time, the semiconductor industry has migrated to
    increasingly larger wafers to build chips. The predominant or
    common wafer size used today for volume production of advanced
    chips is 300 millimeter (mm), or

12-inch,

wafers. Applied offers a comprehensive range of 300mm systems.
    Applied also offers earlier-generation 200mm systems, as well as
    products and services to support all of its systems, which are
    reported under its Applied Global Services segment.

The following summarizes Applied’s portfolio of products
    and their associated process technology areas reported under its
    Silicon Systems Group segment.

Deposition

Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a chip. During
    deposition, layers of dielectric (an insulator), barrier, or
    electrically conductive (typically metal) films are deposited or
    grown on a wafer. Applied currently provides equipment to
    perform four types of deposition: ALD, CVD, ECD and PVD. In
    addition, Applied’s RTP systems can be used to perform
    certain types of dielectric deposition.

Atomic
    Layer Deposition

ALD is an advanced technology in which atoms are deposited one
    layer at a time to build chip structures. This technology
    enables customers to fabricate thin films of either conducting
    or insulating material with uniform coverage in

sub-nanometer

sized structures. Applied offers ALD chambers for depositing
    tungsten and high-k/metal gate films. In 2010, the Company
    introduced its Applied Endura iLB PVD/ALD system, an advancement
    in ALD technology that



enables customers to shrink the contact structures to increase
    signal speeds in 22nm and beyond logic and memory devices.

Chemical
    Vapor Deposition

CVD is used to deposit dielectric and metal films on a wafer.
    During the CVD process, gases that contain atoms of the material
    to be deposited react on the wafer surface, forming a thin film
    of solid material. Films deposited by CVD may be silicon oxide,
    single-crystal epitaxial silicon, amorphous silicon, silicon
    nitride, dielectric anti-reflective coatings, low k dielectric
    (for highly efficient insulating materials), aluminum, titanium,
    titanium nitride, polysilicon, tungsten, refractory metals or
    silicides. Applied offers the following CVD products and
    technologies:

The Applied Producer CVD platform

— This
    high-throughput platform features
    Twin-Chamber

®

modules that have two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up
    to three Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer
    platform, giving it a simultaneous processing capacity of six
    wafers. Many dielectric CVD processes can be performed on this
    platform. The highest productivity model of this system is the
    Applied Producer GT, which has achieved rapid customer
    acceptance due to its fast wafer handling performance and
    compact design.

Low k Dielectric Films

— Low k dielectric
    materials are used in copper-based chip designs to further
    improve interconnect speed. Using conventional CVD equipment,
    the Applied Producer Black
    Diamond

®

family of low k systems provides customers with a proven,
    cost-effective way to integrate a variety of low k films into
    advanced interconnect structures. To further increase the
    performance of the complete multi-layer dielectric structure,
    Applied offers a line of
    BLOK

tm

(barrier low k) films deposited with the Producer system.

Lithography-Enabling Solutions

— Applied offers
    several technologies on the Producer system to help chipmakers
    extend their current 193nm lithography tools, including a line
    of Applied
    APF

®

(advanced patterning film) films and Applied
    DARC

®

(dielectric anti-reflective coating) films. Together, they
    provide a film stack with the precise dimensional control and
    compatibility needed to cost-effectively pattern nano-scale
    features without additional integration complexity.

Gap Fill Films

— There are many steps during
    the chipmaking process in which very small and deep, or high
    aspect ratio (HAR), structures must be filled void-free with a
    dielectric film. Many of these applications include the
    deposition of silicon oxides in substrate isolation structures,
    contacts and interconnects. The Applied Centura Ultima
    HDP-CVD

®

(high-density plasma CVD) and Applied Producer
    HARP

tm

(high aspect ratio process) systems have been workhorses for the
    industry, enabling customers to scale their devices to the 32nm
    node. In 2010, the Company introduced its breakthrough Applied
    Producer
    Eterna

tm

FCVD system. Targeted for 20nm and below chips, the Eterna
    system delivers a liquid-like film that flows freely into
    virtually any structure to provide void-free dielectric fill.

Strain Engineering Solutions

— The Applied
    Producer HARP system also plays a key role in enhancing
    transistor performance, enabling chipmakers to boost chip speed
    by depositing strain-inducing dielectric films. Offering the
    industry’s first integrated stress nitride deposition and
    ultraviolet (UV) cure solution, the Applied Producer Celera CVD
    delivers benchmark levels of high-stress tensile silicon nitride
    films. The Company also offers the Applied Centura SiNgenPlus
    low pressure CVD system for low temperature silicon nitride
    films. Used together, and in conjunction with silicon germanium
    (SiGe) films using Applied’s epitaxial deposition
    technologies, these systems can provide additive strain
    engineering benefits.

Through-Silicon Via Films

— In 2010, Applied
    expanded its offerings for TSV fabrication, with two new CVD
    systems. The Applied Producer
    InVia

tm

system uses a unique process to deposit the critical oxide liner
    film layer in HAR TSV structures, enabling robust electrical
    isolation of the TSV, which is vital for reliable device
    performance. For applications where higher temperatures can
    damage the manufacturing process, the Applied Producer
    Avila

tm

CVD system allows high quality dielectric film deposition at
    stable substrate temperatures at a low cost of ownership.

Epitaxial Deposition

— Epitaxial silicon
    (epitaxy or epi) is a layer of pure silicon grown in a uniform
    crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high quality base
    for the device circuitry. Epi technology is used in an
    increasing number of integrated circuit devices in both the
    wafer substrate and transistor areas of a chip to



enhance speed. The Applied Centura Epi system integrates pre-
    and post-epi processes on the same system to improve film
    quality and reduce production costs. This system is also used
    for SiGe epi technology, which reduces power usage and increases
    speed in certain types of advanced chips. For emerging
    transistor designs, the Applied Centura RP Epi system offers
    selective epi processes to enable faster transistor switching
    through strain engineering techniques.

Polysilicon Deposition

— Polysilicon is a type
    of silicon used to form portions of the transistor structure
    within the integrated circuit device. The Applied Centura
    Polygen

tm

LPCVD system is a single-wafer, multi-chamber product that
    deposits thin polysilicon films at high temperatures to create
    transistor gate structures. To address the challenging
    requirements of shrinking gate dimensions, the Applied Centura
    DPN Gate Stack system integrates chambers for decoupled plasma
    nitridation (DPN), RTP anneal and polysilicon deposition on one
    platform to enable superior film quality and material properties.

Tungsten Deposition

— Tungsten is used in the
    contact area of a chip that connects the transistors to the
    wiring circuitry. In aluminum-based devices, tungsten is also
    used in the structures that connect the multiple layers of
    aluminum wiring. Applied has two products for depositing
    tungsten: the Applied Centura
    Sprint

®

Tungsten CVD system for 90nm and below devices and the Applied
    Centura iSprint ALD/CVD system for more advanced applications.
    The latter product combines ALD technology and CVD chambers on
    the same platform.

Electrochemical
    Deposition

Electrochemical deposition is a process by which metal atoms
    from a chemical fluid (an electrolyte) are deposited on the
    surface of an immersed object. Its main application in the
    semiconductor industry is to deposit copper in interconnect
    wiring structures. This process step follows the deposition of
    barrier and seed layers which prevent the copper from
    contaminating other areas of the device and improve the adhesion
    of the copper filmenable electrodeposition to occur. As a result
    of Applied’s acquisition of Semitool, the Company offers
    two ECD systems: the Applied Raider ECD for electroplating
    advanced chip interconnect structures, and the Applied Raider S
    ECD for advanced TSV packaging applications.

Physical
    Vapor Deposition

PVD is a physical process in which atoms of a gas, such as
    argon, are accelerated toward a metal target. The metal atoms
    chip off, or sputter away, and are then deposited on the wafer.
    The Applied Endura PVD system offers a broad range of advanced
    metal deposition processes, including aluminum, aluminum alloys,
    cobalt,

titanium/titanium

nitride, tantalum/tantalum nitride, tungsten/tungsten nitride,
    nickel, vanadium and copper. In 2010, Applied celebrated the
    20th year of its Applied Endura platform, the most successful
    metal deposition system in the history of the semiconductor
    industry.

The Applied Endura CuBS (copper barrier/seed) PVD system is
    widely used by customers for fabricating copper-based chips.
    Using PVD technology, the system deposits a tantalum-based
    barrier film that prevents copper material from entering other
    areas of the device and then a copper seed layer that primes the
    structure for the subsequent deposition of bulk copper. The
    Applied Endura CuBS RFX PVD system extends cost-effective CuBS
    technology to the 22nm node. In 2010, Applied introduced two new
    PVD systems for creating the leading-edge chips needed for the
    next generation of smart devices. The Applied Endura
    Avenir

tm

RF PVD system sequentially deposits the multiple metal film
    layers that form the heart of the industry’s new, faster,
    metal gate transistors. The Applied Endura iLB PVD/ALD system
    advances the

state-of-the-art

in ALD technology, enabling customers to shrink their
    speed-critical contact structures for 20nm and below devices.

Applied’s Endura system has also been used for many years
    in back-end applications to deposit metal layers before final
    bump or wire bonding packaging steps are performed. The Applied
    Charger

tm

UBM PVD system, which is specifically designed for under-bump
    metallization (UBM) and other back-end processes, features
    linear architecture for reliable performance and very high
    productivity at a low cost per wafer.



Etch

Etching is used many times throughout the integrated circuit
    manufacturing process to selectively remove material from the
    surface of a wafer. Before etching begins, the wafer is coated
    with a light-sensitive film, called photoresist. A
    photolithography process then projects the circuit pattern onto
    the wafer. Etching removes material only from areas dictated by
    the photoresist pattern. Applied offers a wide range of systems
    for etching dielectric, metal and silicon films to meet the
    requirements of

sub-100nm

processing.

Applied’s Producer Etch system utilizes the Company’s
    Twin-Chamber Producer platform to target cost-sensitive
    dielectric etch applications. To address advanced dielectric
    etch applications, the Applied Centura
    Enabler

®

E5 Etch system enables customers to create the 40:1 HAR contact
    features that are critical to the yield and performance of 32nm
    and below DRAM and Flash memory chips. The Applied Centura
    Carina

tm

system uses innovative, high-temperature technology to deliver
    the etch capability essential for scaling logic and memory
    devices with high-k/metal gates at 45nm and below.

In 2010, the Company introduced its Applied Centura
    AdvantEdge

tm

Mesa

tm

silicon etch system for fabricating nano-scale circuit features
    with angstrom-level precision. The system has achieved strong
    acceptance by customers, providing the critical technical
    capability needed for their next-generation devices. The Applied
    Centura
    Mariana

tm

Trench Etch system provides customers with the capability to
    scale DRAM capacitors by enabling the etching of 80:1 aspect
    ratio structures. The Applied Centura
    Silvia

tm

system is specifically designed for etching small, deep holes
    for TSV applications in 3D-ICs. For etching metals, the Applied
    Opus

tm

AdvantEdge Metal Etch uses an optimized 5-chamber platform
    configuration that enables customers to extend aluminum
    interconnect technology and productivity for flash and DRAM
    memory applications.

Rapid
    Thermal Processing

RTP is a process in which a wafer is subjected to rapid bursts
    of intense heat that can take the wafer from room temperature to
    more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in less than 10 seconds. A rapid
    thermal process is used mainly for annealing, which modifies the
    properties of deposited films. The Applied Centura
    Radiance

®

Plus

and Applied Vantage
    RadOx

tm

RTP systems feature advanced RTP technology with differing
    platform designs. While the multi-chamber Centura platform
    offers exceptional process flexibility, the streamlined
    two-chamber Vantage platform is designed for dedicated
    high-volume manufacturing. These single-wafer RTP systems are
    also used for growing high quality oxide and oxynitride films,
    deposition steps that traditional large batch furnaces can no
    longer achieve with the necessary precision and control. With
    its proprietary radical-based oxidation process, the Applied
    Vantage RadOx system deposits high-performance transistor gate
    oxides with high productivity and low operating cost for flash
    memory applications. In 2010, the Company introduced its
    laser-based Applied Vantage
    Astra

tm

millisecond anneal system for creating the sensitive nickel
    silicide transistor contact layers, enabling faster, lower
    power-consumption logic chips.

Chemical
    Mechanical Planarization

The CMP process removes material from a wafer to create a flat
    (planarized) surface. This process allows subsequent
    photolithography patterning steps to occur with greater accuracy
    and enables film layers to build with minimal height variations.
    Applied has led the industry with its 300mm Applied
    Reflexion

®

LK system, with features such as integrated cleaning, film
    measurement and process control capabilities. In 2010, Applied
    introduced its Applied Reflexion GT CMP system, an innovative
    dual-wafer design that increases performance while lowering
    system cost of ownership in fabricating copper interconnects.

Surface
    Preparation

Cleaning the surface of the wafer is critical to the adhesion
    and quality of films that are subsequently deposited in the chip
    fabrication process. Through its acquisition of Semitool,
    Applied offers several surface preparation systems. The Applied
    Raider SP can incorporate several types of cleaning methods,
    including spray, vapor, immersion, megasonics and anneal
    technologies with automated single or dual-side wafer processing
    for high volume manufacturing.



Metrology
    and Wafer Inspection

Applied offers several products for measuring features and
    inspecting defects on the wafer during various stages of the
    fabrication process. These systems enable customers to
    characterize and control critical dimension (CD) and defect
    issues, especially at advanced generation technology nodes.

Critical
    Dimension and Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscopes
    (CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)

Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an electron beam to
    form images of microscopic features of a patterned wafer at
    extremely high magnification. Applied’s SEM products
    provide customers with full automation, along with the high
    accuracy and sensitivity needed for measuring very small CDs.
    The Applied
    VeritySEM

®

metrology system uses proprietary SEM imaging technology to
    enable precise control of the lithography and etching processes.
    The VeritySEM measures CDs at a precision of less than 0.3nm, a
    requirement for 32nm and below device production and
    incorporates automation and software advancements for
    significantly higher throughput. Applied’s OPC
    Check

tm

software for the VeritySEM system performs automated
    qualification of OPC-based (optical proximity correction) chip
    designs, significantly reducing mask (see Mask Making section
    below) verification time over conventional manual methods.

DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (such as particles,
    scratches or residues) that are first located by a defect
    detection system and then classify the defects to identify their
    source. The high-throughput, fully automatic Applied
    SEMVision

tm

Defect Analysis products enable customers to use this technology
    as an integral part of their production lines to analyze defects
    as small as 30nm with industry-leading throughput.

Wafer
    Inspection

Using laser-based technology, defects can be detected on
    patterned wafers (wafers with printed circuit images) as they
    move between processing steps. Defects include particles, open
    circuit lines, and shorts between lines. Incorporating key
    advances in imaging technology, the Applied
    ComPlus

tm

Inspection system, for darkfield applications, detects defects
    in devices with advanced design rules with the high speed
    required for customers’ volume production lines. The
    Applied
    UVision

®

4 wafer Inspection system was introduced in 2010, enabling
    customers to detect yield-limiting defects in the critical
    patterning layers of 22nm and below logic and memory devices
    using DUV laser-based imaging technology.

Mask
    Making

Masks are used by photolithography systems to transfer
    microscopic circuit designs onto wafers. Since an imperfection
    in a mask may be replicated on the wafer, the mask must be
    virtually defect-free. Applied provides systems for etching and
    inspecting masks.

In 2010, the Company introduced its Applied Centura
    Tetra

tm

X Advanced Reticle Etch system, an advanced etch tool for
    fabricating leading-edge masks at 22nm and beyond.
    Applied’s Tetra line of systems has been used by mask
    makers worldwide to etch the majority of high-end masks over the
    last five years. Applied also introduced the Applied
    Aera3

tm

Mask Inspection system which allows customers to meet the most
    critical defect detection challenges of 22nm masks. Using
    sophisticated aerial imaging technology, the Aera3 allows users
    to immediately see how the pattern on the mask will appear on
    the wafer, revealing only the defects most likely to print and
    significantly reducing inspection time.

    scheduling solution for optimizing the movement of wafers during
    the lithography process to reduce cycle time and increase tool
    utilization.

Sub-Fab

Systems

— A significant component of solar PV chip
    manufacturing is the ancillary equipment such as pumps and
    abatement systems that are connected to the process chambers.
    Located outside the clean area of the facility in the

sub-fab,

this equipment controls fab emissions to assure clean,
    sustainable chip manufacturing.

Abatement Control Systems

— In 2010, the
    Company introduced its Applied

    and vacuum pumping solution for controlling emissions and
    reducing energy costs in the fab. Synchronized with an Applied
    process tool, the iSYS system can deliver typical annual savings
    in power, water and gas consumption equivalent to 200MWh of
    energy compared to currently available technologies.

Display
    Segment

Applied’s AKT subsidiary, reported under the Display
    segment, designs, manufactures and sells equipment to fabricate
    thin film transistor LCDs for televisions, computer displays and
    other consumer-oriented electronic applications. While
    similarities exist between the technologies utilized in
    chipmaking and LCD fabrication, the most significant differences
    are in the size and composition of the substrate. Substrates
    used to manufacture LCD panels can be more than 70 times larger
    in area than 300mm wafers and are made of glass, while wafers
    are made of silicon.

Applied supplies a wide range of systems that process and test
    different glass substrate sizes. For fabricating the transistor
    layer of these panels, the Company offers a line of
    plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) systems that use



multi-chamber platform architecture to deposit dielectric and
    semiconducting films. The
    AKT-PiVot

tm

55KV system employs high-productivity, cost-efficient PVD
    technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide
    films on the substrate. For manufacturing the color filter of
    LCD panels, Applied offers the AKT-NEW
    ARISTO

tm

for transparent conductive oxide film deposition.

To complement these systems, Applied also offers a line of
    electron beam test (EBT) systems for testing substrates during
    production for defective pixels and other imperfections.
    Featuring one of the industry’s fastest and most accurate
    pixel test technologies with the lowest operating cost, the EBT
    systems’ non-contact test technology enables the safe
    testing of high-value LCD TV panels without damaging or
    scratching the display.

To meet growing consumer demand for larger, more cost-effective
    LCD TVs, LCD manufacturers have moved to increasingly
    larger-sized substrates. Applied’s latest generation (Gen)
    10 systems can process substrates sized at approximately 2.85 x
    3.05 meters, with each substrate enabling the production of up
    to six

65-inch

LCD
    TV screens. These Gen-10 systems include the AKT-90K PECVD and
    the Gen-10 AKT-90K EBT products.

Energy
    and Environmental Solutions Segment

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes
    manufacturing solutions for the generation and conservation of
    energy. To increase the conversion efficiency and yields of
    solar PV devices, Applied offers manufacturing solutions for
    wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si) and glass based thin film
    applications.

Applied’s portfolio of solar PV cell fabrication
    technologies has made it a leading supplier of c-Si
    manufacturing systems worldwide. Key benefits of these systems
    are high-productivity, advanced ultra-thin wafer handling, and
    extensive automation, helping customers to lower the cost per
    watt of electricity from solar PVs. Applied offers a
    comprehensive line of automated metallization and test systems
    for c-Si cell manufacturing. The Applied Baccini systems offer
    high-precision printing capability designed to increase the
    efficiency of c-Si solar cells. Applied also offers systems for
    slicing and squaring wafers from silicon ingots. The high
    productivity and performance of the Applied HCT B5 platform have
    made it the leading wire saw used by solar PV cell manufacturers
    worldwide. The Company also offers the Applied HCT Diamond
    Squarer

tm

system, which uses diamond wire technology to eliminate the need
    for abrasive slurry and reduces electricity consumption.

Thin film solar technologies are ideally suited for large-scale
    applications, such as utility scale solar farms and commercial
    rooftops, where space is not a constraint. The Company offers
    the Applied AKT PECVD system for depositing low temperature
    polysilicon films for thin film applications. Applied also
    offers the
    ATON

tm

in-line deposition system, a large-area platform for
    high-quality deposition and high-throughput in both c-Si and
    thin film solar PV manufacturing.

Prior to the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied offered its
    fully-integrated
    SunFab

tm

production line for manufacturing large-size thin film panels.
    In the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied restructured its
    Energy and Environmental Solutions segment in response to
    adverse market conditions for thin film solar, including delays
    in utility-scale solar adoption, solar panel manufacturers’
    challenges in obtaining affordable capital, changes and
    uncertainty in government renewable energy policies, and
    competitive pressure from c-Si solar technologies. As part of
    the restructuring, Applied discontinued sales to new customers
    of its fully-integrated SunFab lines, but will offer individual
    tools for thin film solar manufacturing. Applied is supporting
    existing SunFab line customers with services, upgrades and
    capacity increases through its Applied Global Services segment
    and will continue RD&E efforts to improve thin film panel
    efficiency and high-productivity deposition.

Other products offered under the Energy and Environmental
    Solutions segment include

roll-to-roll,

vacuum web coating systems for high-performance deposition of a
    range of films on flexible substrates for functional, aesthetic
    or optical properties. The Company’s Applied
    Topmet

tm

4450, is the world’s largest and fastest

roll-to-roll

machine for depositing ultra-thin aluminum films for flexible
    packaging applications.

Backlog

Applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order
    backlog and customer commitments. Backlog consists of:
    (1) orders for which written authorizations have been
    accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next
    12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not
    been recognized; (2) contractual service



revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next
    12 months; and (3) orders for SunFab lines that are
    anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next
    12 months.

Applied’s backlog increased from $2.7 billion at
    October 25, 2009 to $3.2 billion at October 31,
    2010. Applied’s backlog on any particular date is not
    necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding
    period. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel
    orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation
    penalties. Delays in delivery schedules

and/or

a
    reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a
    material adverse effect on Applied’s business and results
    of operations.

Manufacturing,
    Raw Materials and Supplies

Applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of
    procurement, assembly, test and integration of various
    proprietary and commercial parts, components and subassemblies
    (collectively, parts) that are used to manufacture systems.
    Manufacturing requires raw materials, including a wide variety
    of mechanical and electrical components, to be manufactured to
    Applied’s specifications. Applied uses numerous companies,
    including contract manufacturers, to supply parts and assembly
    services for the manufacture and support of its products.
    Although Applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts
    are available from multiple qualified suppliers, this is not
    always possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be obtained
    from only a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.
    Applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of
    production and service interruptions, as well as shortages of
    key parts, by: (1) selecting and qualifying alternate
    suppliers for key parts; (2) monitoring the financial
    condition of key suppliers; (3) maintaining appropriate
    inventories of key parts; (4) qualifying new parts on a
    timely basis; and (5) locating certain manufacturing
    operations in areas that are closer to suppliers and customers
    Applied is implementing a more distributed manufacturing model,
    which includes transitioning certain manufacturing and supply
    chain activities from the United States and Europe to Singapore,
    Taiwan and other countries in Asia and completing assembly of
    some systems at the customer site.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s long-term growth strategy requires continued
    development of new products. Applied’s significant
    investment in research, development and engineering (RD&E)
    has generally enabled it to deliver new products and
    technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus
    allowing customers to incorporate these products into their
    manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology
    selection cycle. Applied works closely with its global customers
    to design systems and processes that meet their planned
    technical and production requirements. Product development and
    engineering organizations are located primarily in the United
    States, as well as in Europe, Israel, Taiwan and China. In
    addition, Applied outsources certain RD&E activities, some
    of which are performed outside the United States, primarily in
    India. Process support and customer demonstration laboratories
    are located in the United States, China, Taiwan, Europe and
    Israel.

Applied’s investments in RD&E for product development
    and engineering programs to create or improve products and
    technologies over the last three years were as follows:
    $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2010,
    $934 million (19 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2009
    and $1.1 billion (14 percent of net sales) in fiscal
    2008. Applied has spent an average of 13 percent of net
    sales in RD&E over the last five years. In addition to
    RD&E for specific product technologies, Applied maintains
    ongoing programs for automation control systems, materials
    research and environmental control that are applicable to its
    products.

In fiscal 2010, Applied developed new technology to enable
    next-generation 22nm and below chip designs. These systems were
    designed to help customers continue their drive to pack more
    transistors in the same space using using high-k/metal gate
    technologies and double patterning processes. Applied also
    developed technology for through-silicon vias (TSVs), an
    emerging solution for interconnecting three dimensional chip
    stacks to provide better device performance, lower power
    consumption and the integration of heterogeneous devices. In the
    solar PV area, Applied continued the development of its
    precision wafering and cell manufacturing products for lowering
    the cost of producing solar-generated electricity through
    advanced crystalline silicon technology. RD&E also included
    activities to develop products that enable lower-cost production
    of solar energy, production of light emitting diode (LED)
    devices for display backlighting and general lighting, and other
    products to enable energy conservation.



In fiscal 2009, Applied focused on developing systems for
    semiconductor customers’ new chip designs with 32nm and
    below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors
    using strain engineering and

high-k/metal

gate technologies, as well as double patterning processes that
    enable customers to extend their existing 193nm lithography
    tools through additional technology generations. Applied also
    focused on developing technology for manufacturing next
    generation displays. RD&E also included activities to
    develop products that enable lower-cost production of solar
    energy and other products to enable energy conservation.

In fiscal 2008, Applied focused on the development of processes
    and systems for the continued scaling of semiconductor devices.
    Applied pioneered a self-aligned double patterning approach that
    can enable 22nm and below device fabrication using conventional
    optical lithography. The Company also developed technology for
    the implementation of through-silicon vias. Efforts were also
    focused on developing the systems and technology to reduce the

cost-per-watt

of solar electricity.

Because of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied
    markets and sells products worldwide through a direct sales
    force. Approximately 88 percent of Applied’s fiscal
    2010 net sales were to regions outside of the
    United States.

General economic conditions impact Applied’s business and
    financial results. From time to time, the markets in which
    products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may
    negatively impact sales. Applied’s business is usually not
    seasonal in nature, but it is highly cyclical, based on capital
    equipment investment by major semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar PV and other manufacturers. Customers’ expenditures
    depend on many factors, including: anticipated market demand and
    pricing for semiconductors, LCDs, solar cells and modules, and
    other substrates; the development of new technologies;
    customers’ factory utilization; capital resources and
    financing; and global and regional economic conditions.

Applied manages its business and reports financial results based
    on the segments described above, but does not allocate certain
    sales and marketing costs to the segments.

Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and
    long-lived assets attributable to Applied’s geographic

Competition

The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive
    and characterized by rapid technological change. Applied’s
    ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely
    commercialize its technology, continually improve its products
    and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer
    requirements. Significant competitive factors include technical
    capability and differentiation, productivity and
    cost-effectiveness. The importance of these factors varies
    according to customers’ needs, including product mix and
    respective product requirements, applications, and the timing
    and circumstances of purchasing decisions. Substantial
    competition exists in all areas of Applied’s business.
    Competitors range from small companies that compete with a
    single product

and/or

in a
    single region, to global, diversified companies with a range of
    products. Applied’s ability to compete requires a high
    level of investment in RD&E, marketing and sales and global
    customer support activities. Management believes that many of
    Applied’s products have strong competitive positions.

The competitive environment for each segment is described below:

The semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by
    consumer demand for lower-cost electronic products with
    increased capability and, to a lesser extent, by demand for
    commercial applications. As a result, products within the
    Silicon Systems Group segment are subject to rapid changes in
    customer requirements, including transitions to smaller
    dimensions, new materials and an increasing number of
    applications. While certain existing technologies may be adapted
    to new requirements, some applications create the need for an
    entirely different technical approach. The rapid pace of
    technological change can quickly diminish the value of current
    technologies and products and create opportunities for existing
    and new competitors. Applied offers a broad portfolio of
    technically- differentiated products that must continuously
    evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to
    compete effectively. Applied allocates resources among its
    numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to
    invest in an individual product to the same degree as
    competitors who specialize in fewer products. There are a number
    of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment
    industry, with some offering a single product line and others
    offering multiple product lines. These competitors range from
    suppliers serving a single region to global, diversified
    companies. Factors that influenced the competitive environment
    for the Silicon Systems Group in fiscal 2010 included the
    rebound in the semiconductor industry, driven by higher demand
    for PCs and cell phones as well as the introduction of tablet
    computers. Higher factory utilization rates and tight device
    supply led manufacturers to increase their wafer fab equipment
    (WFE) capital spending, which is the major driver for Silicon
    Systems Group net sales.

Products and services within the Applied Global Services segment
    are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements
    and a diverse group of numerous competitors. To compete
    effectively, Applied offers products and services to reduce
    costs, improve productivity, and lessen the environmental impact
    of customers’ fab operations. Significant competitive
    factors include productivity, cost-effectiveness, and the level
    of technical service and support. The importance of these
    factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type
    of products or services offered. Customers with more significant
    operations

and/or

expertise may require fewer service products than customers who
    place greater reliance on an outsourcing model. Industry
    conditions that affected Applied Global Services’ sales of
    spares and services in fiscal 2010 were principally
    semiconductor manufacturers’ wafer starts as well as
    additions to the tool installed base.

Products in the Display segment are subject to strong
    competition from a number of major competitors. Applied holds
    established market positions with its technically-differentiated
    thin film technology (TFT)-LCD manufacturing solutions for
    PECVD, color filter PVD and TFT array testing, although its
    market position could



change quickly due to customers’ evolving requirements. The
    competitive environment for Applied’s Display segment in
    fiscal 2010 was characterized by increased capacity requirements
    for larger flat panel televisions and growing global demand for
    touch screen devices.

Applied’s products within the Energy and Environmental
    Solutions segment compete in diverse market areas, including
    equipment to make solar PV cells and modules. All of these
    markets are driven by extreme pressure to reduce overall
    production costs and improve cell performance. In this segment,
    Applied offers products primarily for c-Si wafer-based
    applications. Applied competes with many other companies, some
    of which have more experience with solar applications and some
    of which are just entering the solar equipment business.

Patents
    and Licenses

Management believes that Applied’s competitive position
    significantly depends upon the Company’s research,
    development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing
    capabilities, and not just on its patent position. However,
    protection of Applied’s technological assets through
    enforcement of its intellectual property rights, including
    patents, is important. Therefore, Applied’s practice is to
    file patent applications in the United States and other
    countries for inventions that Applied considers significant.
    Applied has a substantial number of patents in the United States
    and other countries, and additional applications are pending for
    new inventions. Although Applied does not consider its business
    materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Applied
    and the products made and sold under its patents, taken as a
    whole, are a significant element of Applied’s business. In
    addition to patents, Applied also possesses other intellectual
    property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets and
    copyrights.

Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements
    with other companies when management determines that it is in
    the Company’s best interest to do so. Applied pays
    royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use,
    in several of its products, of certain patented technologies
    that are licensed to Applied for the life of the patents.
    Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third
    parties. Royalties received from or paid to third parties have
    not been, and are not expected to be, material to Applied’s
    consolidated results of operations.

In the normal course of business, Applied periodically receives
    and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In
    responding to such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful
    for Applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights.
    However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights
    will be available to Applied on commercially reasonable terms,
    or at all. If Applied is not able to resolve or settle claims,
    obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms,

and/or

successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Environmental
    Matters

Applied maintains a number of environmental, health and safety
    programs that are primarily preventive in nature. As part of
    these programs, Applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance
    with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Applied has
    trained personnel to conduct investigations of any
    environmental, health or safety incidents, including, without
    limitation, spills, releases or possible contamination.

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental, health
    and safety provisions, including, without limitation, those
    regulating the discharge of materials into the environment,
    remedial agreements and other actions relating to the
    environment have not had, and are not expected to have, a
    material effect on Applied’s capital expenditures,
    competitive position, financial condition or results of

Employees

At October 31, 2010, Applied employed approximately 13,000
    regular employees and 1,325 temporary employees. In the
    high-technology industry, competition for highly-skilled
    employees is intense. Applied believes



that its future success is highly dependent upon its continued
    ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified employees.
    There can be no assurance that Applied will be able to attract,
    hire, assimilate, motivate and retain a sufficient number of
    qualified employees.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

The following factors could materially affect Applied’s
    business, financial condition or results of operations and
    should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its
    business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere
    in this report.

The
    industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to
    predict.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar and related industries, Applied is subject to business
    cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be
    difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These
    industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes
    in customers’ manufacturing capacity and advanced
    technology requirements and spending, which depend in part on
    customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes,
    end-use demand, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well
    as the rate of technology transitions and customers’ access
    to affordable capital. These changes have affected the timing
    and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in
    technology, and continue to affect Applied’s orders, net
    sales, operating expenses and net income.

To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves,
    Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage
    its resources and production capacity for each of its segments
    as well as across multiple segments. During periods of
    increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient
    manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand;
    effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and
    motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and
    continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand,
    Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with
    prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply
    chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does
    not accurately forecast and timely and appropriately adapt to
    changes in its business environment, Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations may be materially
    and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with the difficult financial
    markets and uncertain global economy.

The tightening of the credit markets, disruption in the
    financial markets, and global economic recession that began in
    2008 contributed to significant slowdowns in the industries in
    which Applied operates. Although economic and market conditions
    have improved, continuing difficulties in the financial markets
    and uncertainty regarding the global economic recovery are
    posing challenges. The markets for semiconductors and flat panel
    displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending.
    Economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in consumer
    spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out,
    cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or
    services, which may reduce net sales, reduce backlog, and affect
    Applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales. Difficulties
    in obtaining capital, uncertain market conditions, or reduced
    profitability may also cause some customers to scale back
    operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or
    file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations,
    leading to customers’ reduced research and development
    funding

and/or

capital expenditures and, in turn, lower sales

and/or

additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These
    conditions may also similarly affect key suppliers, which could
    impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for
    Applied’s products or added costs. In addition, these
    conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation
    of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect
    Applied’s ability to compete effectively.

Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also
    makes it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating
    results, make business decisions, and identify the risks that
    may affect its business, sources and uses of cash, financial
    condition and results of operations. Applied may be required to
    implement additional cost reduction efforts, including
    restructuring activities,

and/or

modify its business model, which may adversely affect
    Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in a
    market recovery. In addition, Applied maintains an investment
    portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign
    exchange, market and interest rate risks. The risks to
    Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if
    financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the
    value and liquidity of the investment portfolio and return on
    pension assets could be negatively impacted and lead to
    impairment charges. If Applied does not timely and appropriately
    adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain



macroeconomic environment and industry conditions,
    Applied’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the
    various industries in which it operates.

The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related
    industries in which Applied operates are characterized by
    ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries,
    including:

•

increasing capital requirements for building and operating new
    fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the
    necessary capital, particularly in a difficult financial market;

•

differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and
    solar industries;

•

the increasing importance of establishing, improving and
    maintaining strong relationships with customers;

•

abrupt and unforeseen shifts in the nature and amount of
    customer and end-user demand;

•

the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from
    product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the
    adoption rate for new manufacturing technology;

•

the need to reduce the total cost of manufacturing system
    ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost consumer
    electronics as compared to business information technology
    spending;

•

the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and
    productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as
    a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and
    reliability;

•

the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing
    products with sufficient differentiation to influence
    customers’ purchasing decisions;

•

requirements for shorter cycle times for the development,
    manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;

•

price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, LCDs and
    solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such
    products;

•

the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to
    maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for
    production;

•

the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied
    products; and

•

the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the
    environmental impact and sustainability associated with
    manufacturing operations.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes in the semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar and related industries, its business, financial condition
    and results of operations could be materially and adversely
    affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to
    the semiconductor industry.

The greatest portion of Applied’s consolidated net sales
    and profitability historically has been derived from sales of
    manufacturing equipment by the Silicon Systems Group to the
    global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the
    revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales of service
    products to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor
    industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that
    industry in addition to the general industry changes described
    in the preceding risk factor, including:

•

the increasing cost of research and development due to many
    factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip; the use of
    new materials such as cobalt and yttrium; new and more complex
    device structures; more applications and process steps;
    increasing chip design costs; and the increasing cost and
    complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;

•

the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and
    number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;



•

differing market growth rates and capital requirements for
    different applications, such as NAND Flash, DRAM, logic and
    foundry, and the resulting effect on customers’ spending
    patterns and on Applied’s ability to compete in these
    market segments;

•

the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor
    manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and
    smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting
    impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in
    capital equipment;

•

semiconductor manufacturers’ increasing adoption of more
    productive 300mm systems in relation to 200mm system capacity,
    and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing equipment
    and services;

•

the decreasing rate of capital expenditures as a percentage of
    semiconductor manufacturers’ revenue;

•

shorter cycle times between customers’ order placement and
    product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and
    manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;

•

technology developments in related markets, such as lithography,
    to which Applied may need to adapt;

•

competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance market
    position;

•

the importance of growing market positions in larger market
    segments, such as etch and inspection;

•

the increasing concentration of wafer starts in one country,
    Korea, where Applied’s service penetration and
    service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other
    regions;

•

the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading
    certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new
    fabrication plant, while others require less technologically
    advanced products; and

•

the cost, technical complexity and timing of a proposed
    transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to
    the flat panel display industry.

The global flat panel display industry historically has
    experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment
    investment levels, due in part to the limited number of LCD
    manufacturers and the concentrated nature of LCD end-use
    applications. Recently, industry growth has depended to a
    considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger
    and more advanced TVs. In addition to the general industry
    changes described above in the third risk factor, the display
    industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that
    industry, including:

•

the planned expansion of manufacturing facilities in China by
    Chinese display manufacturers as well as manufacturers from
    other countries, and the ability of non-Chinese manufacturers to
    obtain government approvals;

•

technical and financial difficulties associated with
    transitioning to larger substrate sizes for LCDs;

•

the effect of a slowing rate of transition to larger substrate
    sizes on capital intensity and product differentiation;

•

technical difficulties and costs associated with developing new
    technologies for use in LCD manufacturing, such as LEDs for
    backlighting;

•

new energy efficiency standards for large-screen LCD
    TVs; and

•

uncertainty with respect to future LCD technology end-use
    applications and growth drivers.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.



Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to
    the solar industry.

Applied anticipates that an increasing portion of its business
    will be in the emerging solar market, which, in addition to the
    general industry changes described above in the third risk
    factor, is characterized by ongoing changes specific to the
    solar industry, including:

•

the need to continually decrease the

cost-per-watt

of electricity produced by solar PV products by, among other
    things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for
    solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency
    of solar PVs;

•

the impact on demand for solar PV products arising from the cost
    of electricity generated by solar PVs compared to the cost of
    electricity from the existing grid or other energy sources;

•

the varying energy policies of governments around the world and
    their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar PV
    market, including the availability and amount of government
    incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs,
    rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity
    providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable
    sources, and goals for solar installations on government
    facilities;

•

the cost of polysilicon and other materials;

•

changes in the nature and amount of end demand for solar PVs
    that may adversely impact the sales growth rates and
    profitability of Applied’s products;

•

varying levels of infrastructure investment for “smart
    grid” technologies to modernize and enhance the
    transmission, distribution and use of electricity, which link
    distributed solar PV sources to population centers, increase
    transmission capability, and optimize power usage;

•

access to affordable financing and capital by customers and
    end-users; and

•

the growing number of solar PV manufacturers and increasing
    global production capacity for solar PVs, primarily in China as
    a result of increased solar subsidies and lower manufacturing
    costs, which may lead to oversupply.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to
    competition and rapid technological changes.

As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment, its
    future success depends on many factors, including the effective
    commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment,
    services and related products. In addition, Applied must
    successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing
    market share in existing markets, expanding into related
    markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth
    rates, while constantly improving its operational performance.
    The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of
    products in more varied competitive environments have grown
    increasingly complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new
    or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced
    profits. Applied’s performance may be adversely affected if
    it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:

•

develop new products, improve

and/or

develop new applications for existing products, and adapt
    similar products for use by customers in different applications

and/or

markets with varying technical requirements;

•

appropriately price and achieve market acceptance of products;

•

differentiate its products from those of competitors and any
    disruptive technologies, meet performance specifications, and
    drive efficiencies and cost reductions;

•

maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to
    different markets, customers and applications;



•

allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among
    Applied’s products and between the development of new
    products and the enhancement of existing products, as most
    appropriate and effective for future growth;

•

reduce the cost of, and improve the productivity of capital
    invested in, R&D activities;

•

accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet
    production schedules for its products;

•

improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost
    efficiencies across product offerings;

•

adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different
    parts of the supply chain;

•

qualify products for volume manufacturing with its
    customers; and

•

implement changes in its design engineering methodology,
    including those that enable reduction of material costs and
    cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts
    used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life
    cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental
    impact.

If Applied does not successfully manage these challenges, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Operating
    in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and
    industries, entail additional challenges.

As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand
    into related or new markets and industries, either with its
    existing products or with new products developed internally or
    obtained through acquisitions. The entry into different markets
    involves additional challenges, including those arising from:

•

the need to devote additional resources to develop new products
    for, and operate in, new markets;

•

differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple
    businesses;

•

Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on
    opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;

•

the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations
    in production planning, execution, supply chain management and
    logistics;

•

the adoption of new business models;

•

the need to undertake activities to grow demand for end-products;

•

the need to develop adequate new business processes and systems;

•

Applied’s ability to rapidly expand its operations to meet
    increased demand and the associated effect on working capital;

•

new materials, processes and technologies;

•

the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills
    and expertise in these new areas;

•

new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some
    with limited operating histories, uncertain

and/or

limited funding, evolving business models

and/or

locations in regions where Applied does not have existing
    operations;

•

different customer service requirements;

•

new or different competitors with potentially more financial or
    other resources, industry experience

and/or

established customer relationships;

•

entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels
    of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business,
    employment and safety practices;

•

third parties’ intellectual property rights; and

•

the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry
    standards and practices.



In addition, Applied has begun applying for and receiving
    funding from United States and other government agencies for
    certain strategic development programs to increase its R&D
    resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition
    to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain
    record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing

and/or

other
    obligations.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    its diversification and entry into new markets and industries,
    its business, financial condition and results of operations
    could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to the risks of operating a global
    business.

In fiscal 2010, approximately 88 percent of Applied’s
    net sales were to customers in regions outside the
    United States. Certain of Applied’s R&D and
    manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are
    also located outside the United States, including in Singapore,
    Taiwan, China, Korea, Israel, Italy and Switzerland. Applied is
    also expanding its business and operations in new countries. The
    global nature of Applied’s business and operations presents
    challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:

•

varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and
    demands;

•

political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and
    policies within countries that favor domestic companies over
    non-domestic companies, including customer- or
    government-supported efforts to promote the development and
    growth of local competitors;

•

variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or
    international laws and regulations (including intellectual
    property, labor, tax, and import /export laws), as well as the
    interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;

•

global trade issues, including those related to the
    interpretation and application of import and export licenses;

•

positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible
    national commercial

and/or

security issues posed by international business operations;

•

fluctuating raw material, commodity and energy costs;

•

challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse
    operations and projects ;

•

varying customs, practices and expectations of workers in
    different regions;

•

variations in the ability to develop relationships with local
    customers, suppliers and governments;

•

fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates,
    including the relative strength or weakness of the
    U.S. dollar and the euro;

•

the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in
    different locations;

•

political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes,
    floods or storms), pandemics, terrorism or acts of war in
    locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales;

•

cultural and language differences;

•

shipping costs

and/or

delays;

•

the need to continually improve the Company’s operating
    cost structure;

•

difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into
    new countries;

•

uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various
    countries; and

•

uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture
    and sales of semiconductors, LCDs and solar PVs in the
    developing economies of certain countries.

Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which
    are experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and
    competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and
    Korea present large potential markets



for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term,
    although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins
    for certain products than historically have been achieved in
    other regions. In addition, Applied must regularly reassess the
    size, capability and location of its global infrastructure and
    make appropriate changes, and must have effective change
    management processes and procedures to address changes in its
    business and operations. These challenges may materially and
    adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition
    and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated
    customer base.

Applied’s semiconductor and flat panel display customer
    bases historically have been, and are becoming even more, highly
    concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions.
    For example, in fiscal 2010, four semiconductor manufacturers
    accounted for 51 percent of Silicon Systems Group net
    sales, and five LCD manufacturers accounted for 71 percent
    of Display net sales.Certain customers have experienced
    significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with
    other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or
    engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other
    manufacturers. In addition, customers have entered into
    strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased
    the influence of key industry participants in technology
    decisions made by their partners. Also, certain semiconductor
    and display customers are making an increasingly greater
    percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment
    investments.

In this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively
    limited number of semiconductor and display manufacturers have
    accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a
    substantial portion of Applied’s business, which may result
    in added complexities in managing customer relationships and
    transactions. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and
    sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from
    quarter to quarter and from year to year. If customers do not
    place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel
    orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business. As
    Applied’s products are configured to customer
    specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may
    result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major customers
    may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment,
    intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that
    are less favorable to Applied. These factors could have a
    material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Manufacturing
    interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to
    meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure
    to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or
    obsolete inventory.

Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of
    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly
    changing technical and volume requirements of its customers,
    which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts,
    components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from
    suppliers and timely performance by contract manufacturers. Some
    key parts may be subject to long lead-times

and/or

obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of
    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by
    suppliers located in countries other than the United States,
    including China and Korea. Cyclical industry conditions and the
    volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase
    capital, technical, operational and other risks for companies
    throughout Applied’s supply chain. Further, the adverse
    conditions in the credit and financial markets and industry
    slowdowns in recent periods have caused, and may continue to
    cause, some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses,
    merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection
    and possibly cease operations, potentially affecting
    Applied’s ability to obtain quality parts on a timely
    basis. Applied may experience significant interruptions of its
    manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver
    products or services, increased costs or customer order
    cancellations as a result of:

•

the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver
    sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;

•

volatility in the availability and cost of materials;

•

difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export
    approvals;

•

information technology or infrastructure failures;



•

natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or
    storms); or

•

other causes (such as regional economic downturns, pandemics,
    political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) that could
    result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing inefficiencies,
    increased costs or order cancellations.

In addition, Applied’s need to rapidly increase its
    business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand
    or expedited shipment schedules may exacerbate any interruptions
    in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and
    the associated effect on Applied’s working capital.
    Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is
    different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts
    than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or
    expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in
    anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if
    customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess
    inventory charges. Any or all of these factors could materially
    and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic
    investments.

Applied has made, and in the future intends to make,
    acquisitions of, and investments in, companies, technologies or
    products in existing, related or new markets for Applied.
    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited
    to:

•

diversion of management’s attention from other operational
    matters;

•

inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all;

•

inability to realize anticipated benefits;

•

failure to commercialize purchased technologies;

•

inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that
    may be significantly different from Applied’s existing
    markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions
    and customer relationships;

•

failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees from the
    acquired business;

•

exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker
    expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired
    businesses are located in countries where Applied has not
    historically conducted business;

•

challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more
    widespread operations, projects and people;

•

inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in
    key technologies;

•

inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s
    internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures,

and/or

environmental, health & safety, human resource, or
    other policies or practices;

•

impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a
    result of changing business conditions, technological
    advancements or

worse-than-expected

performance of the segment;

•

the risk of litigation or disputes with customers, suppliers,
    partners or stockholders of an acquisition target arising from a
    proposed or completed transaction;

•

unknown, underestimated

and/or

undisclosed commitments or liabilities;

•

inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical
    resources or facilities for business needs; and

•

ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies,
    products or employees of an acquired business.

Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies,
    including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline
    in value

and/or

not
    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments
    depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited
    or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures,
    requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic
    partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment
    portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and
    macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the



investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to
    impairment charges. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic
    investments are inherently subject to significant risks, and the
    inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and
    adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition
    and results of operations. If Applied does not successfully
    manage the risks associated with acquisitions and strategic
    investments, its business, financial condition and results of
    operations could be materially and adversely affected.

The
    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital
    to Applied’s success.

Applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part
    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.
    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,
    including fluctuations in global economic and industry
    conditions, changes in Applied’s management or leadership,
    competitors’ hiring practices, cost reduction activities
    (including workforce reductions), and the effectiveness of
    Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its
    share-based programs. Applied periodically evaluates its overall
    compensation program and makes adjustments, as appropriate, to
    enhance its competitiveness. If Applied does not successfully
    attract, retain and motivate key employees, Applied may be
    unable to capitalize on its opportunities and its operating
    results may be materially and adversely affected.

The
    failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing
    activities and other operational initiatives could adversely
    affect results of operations.

To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer
    to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies,
    Applied conducts engineering, software development,
    manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside
    the United States, including India, China, and Korea. Applied is
    implementing a more distributed manufacturing model, which
    includes transitioning certain manufacturing and supply chain
    activities from the United States and Europe to Singapore,
    Taiwan and other countries in Asia and completing assembly of
    some systems at the customer site. In addition, Applied
    outsources certain functions to third parties, including
    companies in the United States, India, China, Korea and other
    countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing,
    engineering, customer support, software development, information
    technology support, finance and administrative activities. The
    expanding role of third party providers has required changes to
    Applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new
    procedures and processes for retaining and managing these
    providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as
    warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and
    operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of
    supply, and protect Applied’s intellectual property. If
    Applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix
    of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other
    outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at
    satisfactory quality levels, Applied’s ability to meet
    customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market
    upturn.

In addition, Applied is implementing a comprehensive program to
    better align its global organizations and processes, including
    initiatives to enhance the Asia supply chain, integrate its
    sales teams into the business units, and improve back office and
    information technology infrastructure for more efficient
    transaction processing. Applied also is implementing a
    multi-year, company-wide program to transform certain business
    processes, including the transition to a single enterprise
    resource planning (ERP) software system to perform various
    functions. The implementation of additional functionality to the
    ERP system entails certain risks, including difficulties with
    changes in business processes that could disrupt Applied’s
    operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship
    products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply
    chain and aggregate financial and operational data. The
    implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the
    anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention
    from other operational activities, negatively affect employee
    morale, or have other unintended consequences.

If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its
    outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and
    other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if
    Applied’s third party providers do not perform as
    anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing
    business processes, Applied may not realize anticipated
    productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may
    experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including
    energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or
    delays, inefficiencies in the structure

and/or

operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property
    rights, quality issues, increased product



time-to-market,

and/or

inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which
    could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived
    assets.

Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired
    intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and
    purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not
    amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the
    fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when
    events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
    value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares
    the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its
    associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that
    could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets
    include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates
    of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied
    common stock, changes in the Company’s strategies or
    product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s
    valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires
    management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical
    experience and projections of future operating performance.
    Applied may be required to record a charge to earnings during
    the period in which an impairment of goodwill or amortizable
    intangible assets is determined to exist, which could materially
    and adversely affect Applied’s results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or
    claims and protection of intellectual property
    rights.

Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved
    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,
    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental
    regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product
    liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade
    secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters.
    Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers
    who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other
    obligations related to claims made against such customers by
    third parties.

In February 2010, the Seoul Prosecutor’s Office for the
    Eastern District in Korea indicted certain employees of Applied
    Materials Korea (AMK), including the former head of AMK who at
    the time of indictment was a vice president of Applied
    Materials, Inc., along with employees of several other
    companies, alleging the improper receipt and use of the
    confidential information of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
    (Samsung), a major customer. Hearings on these matters are
    ongoing in the Seoul Eastern District Court.. Applied and
    Samsung entered into a settlement agreement effective as of
    November 1, 2010, which resolves potential civil claims
    related to this matter and which is separate from and does not
    affect the criminal proceedings.

Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and
    associated internal investigations, may (1) be
    time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct;
    (2) divert management’s attention and other Applied
    resources; (3) inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its
    products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages,
    injunctive relief, penalties and fines;

and/or

(5) negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be
    no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal
    proceedings, claims or investigations. If Applied is not able to
    favorably resolve or settle legal proceedings or claims, or in
    the event of any adverse findings against Applied or any of its
    employees, Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
    and Applied may suffer harm to its reputation.

Applied’s success depends in significant part on the
    protection of its intellectual property and other rights.
    Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as
    the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare
    parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue
    opportunities for Applied. Applied’s intellectual property
    rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if
    they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the
    rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not
    adequately protect or assert these rights. Furthermore, the laws
    and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan
    and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of
    Applied’s rights to varying extents, which may not be
    sufficient to protect Applied’s rights. Applied previously
    entered into an arrangement with one of its competitors to
    decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future.
    There can be no assurance that the intended results of this
    arrangement will be achieved or that Applied will be able to
    adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the
    restrictions associated with the arrangement. If Applied is not
    able to favorably resolve or settle claims, obtain or enforce



intellectual property rights, obtain necessary licenses on
    commercially reasonable terms,

and/or

successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property
    position, Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected
    and Applied may suffer harm to its reputation. See Note 18
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Changes
    in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results
    of operations.

As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the
    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment
    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
    Applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be
    affected by numerous factors, including changes in the:
    (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of
    pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; or
    (3) valuation of Applied’s deferred tax assets and
    liabilities.

To better align with the increasingly international nature of
    its business, Applied is transitioning certain manufacturing,
    supply chain, and other operations into Asia, bringing these
    activities closer to customers. These changes are expected to
    result in a reduction of future operating costs. In Singapore,
    Applied is pursuing available tax incentives that provide that
    certain income earned in Singapore would be subject to tax
    holidays or reduced income tax rates. To obtain these tax
    benefits, Applied must meet requirements relating to various
    activities. Applied is engaged in discussions with tax
    authorities in Singapore and the United States concerning these
    incentives. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from
    these initiatives could be materially affected if, among other
    things, applicable requirements are not met, the incentives are
    substantially modified, or if Applied incurs net losses for
    which it cannot claim a deduction.

In addition, Applied is subject to regular examination by the
    Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from
    time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax
    returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable
    or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and
    amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income
    taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied
    believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no
    assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such
    estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve
    the results reflected in the estimates, which may be
    time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that
    Applied will be successful or that any final determination will
    not be materially different from the treatment reflected in
    Applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals,
    which could materially and adversely affect Applied’s
    financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and
    safety regulations.

Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in
    connection with its global business operations, including but
    not limited to: regulations related to the development,
    manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of
    materials used in its products or in producing its products; the
    operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property.
    The failure or inability to comply with existing or future
    environmental and safety regulations, such as those related to
    climate change, could result in: (1) significant
    remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines;
    (3) the suspension or termination of the development,
    manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products;
    (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or
    ability to use its real property;

and/or

(5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of
    which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory
    environment.

Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,
    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and
    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies

and/or

regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates;
    (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional
    regulatory agencies related to international trade; and
    (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and
    regulations. For example, as a public company with global
    operations, Applied is subject to the laws of multiple
    jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing
    bodies, including those related to financial and other
    disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption.
    Changes in laws, regulations and standards may create
    uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with
    new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to
    continue to result in, increased general and administrative
    expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from
    revenue-



generating activities to compliance activities. If Applied is
    found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance
    with applicable laws, rules or regulations, Applied could be
    subject to legal or regulatory sanctions, the public’s
    perception of Applied could decline, and Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Because of the interrelation of Applied’s operations,
    properties within a country may be shared by the segments
    operating within that country. Products in the Silicon Systems
    Group are manufactured in Austin, Texas, Rehovot, Israel; and
    Singapore. Remanufactured products in the Applied Global
    Services segment are produced primarily in Austin, Texas and
    Korea. Products in the Display segment are manufactured in
    Santa Clara, California; Alzenau, Germany; and Tainan,
    Taiwan. Products in the Energy and Environmental Solutions
    segment are primarily manufactured in Alzenau, Germany;
    Cheseaux, Switzerland; Treviso, Italy; and Santa Clara,
    California.



In addition to the above properties, Applied leases office space
    for marketing, sales, engineering and customer support offices
    in 80 locations throughout the world: 19 in Europe, 18 in Japan,
    17 in North America (principally the United States), 9 in China,
    8 in Korea, 7 in Southeast Asia, and 2 in Taiwan. Applied has a
    manufacturing facility of 261,000 square feet in Austin,
    Texas available for sale.

In addition, Applied owns 112 acres of buildable land in
    Texas that could accommodate approximately 1,708,000 square
    feet of additional building space, and 43 acres in
    California that could accommodate approximately
    1,247,000 square feet of additional building space. Applied
    also leases: 4 acres in Italy that could accommodate
    approximately 180,000 square feet of additional building
    space and 10 acres in Israel that could accommodate
    approximately 111,000 square feet of additional building
    space.

Applied considers the properties that it owns or leases as
    adequate to meet its current and future requirements. Applied
    regularly assesses the size, capability and location of its
    global infrastructure and periodically makes adjustments based
    on these assessments.

Dividends

During fiscal 2010, Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.07 per share
    and one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.06 per
    share. The fourth quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share
    declared in fiscal 2010 will be paid on December 15, 2010
    to stockholders of record as of November 24, 2010. During
    fiscal 2009, Applied’s Board of Directors declared four
    quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each.
    Dividends declared during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 amounted to
    $361 million, $320 million and $323 million,
    respectively. Applied currently anticipates that it will
    continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the
    future, although the declaration and amount of any future cash
    dividend are at the discretion of the Board of Directors and
    will depend on Applied’s financial condition, results of
    operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other
    factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in
    the best interests of Applied’s stockholders.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Introduction

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to facilitate
    an understanding of Applied’s business and results of
    operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with
    Applied’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the
    accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
    elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements and
    should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement
    set forth at the beginning of this

Form 10-K.

MD&A consists of the following sections:

•

Overview:

a summary of Applied’s business and
    measurements

•

Results of Operations:

a discussion of operating results.

•

Segment Information:

a discussion of segment operating
    results.

•

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources:

an
    analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual
    obligations and financial position.

•

Critical Accounting Policies:

a discussion of critical
    accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and
    estimates.

Overview

Applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software
    to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar
    photovoltaic (PV) and related industries. Applied’s
    customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and
    chips, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar PV cells
    and modules, and other electronic devices. These customers may
    use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the
    items to other companies for use in advanced electronic
    components. Applied operates in four reportable segments:
    Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and
    Energy and Environmental Solutions. Product development and
    manufacturing activities occur primarily in North America,
    Europe, Israel and Asia. Applied’s broad range of equipment
    and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily
    through a direct sales force.

Applied’s results historically have been driven primarily
    by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on
    end-user demand for electronic products. Each of Applied’s
    businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions, as
    demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change
    depending on supply and demand for chips, LCDs, solar PVs and
    other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as
    global economic and market conditions, and technological
    advances in fabrication processes. After a challenging year in
    fiscal 2009 that was characterized by credit constraints in the
    financial markets, a weak global economy and a semiconductor
    industry downturn, global economic and industry conditions
    affecting Applied’s businesses generally improved in fiscal
    2010, except for conditions in the thin film solar PV market.

The following table presents certain significant measurements
    for the past three fiscal years:

Financial results for fiscal 2010 over fiscal 2009 reflected
    significantly increased demand for manufacturing equipment and
    services due to more favorable global economic and industry
    conditions. The increase in total orders from fiscal 2009 was
    primarily due to increased demand for semiconductor, display and
    crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar PV products, partially offset
    by decreased demand for
    SunFab

tm

thin film solar lines. Net sales increased during fiscal 2010
    compared to fiscal 2009, due primarily to higher sales of
    semiconductor and display equipment.

Also, in fiscal 2010, Applied incurred charges totaling
    $84 million associated with a restructuring program to
    reduce its global workforce as of October 25, 2009 by
    approximately 1,000 positions over a period of 18 months.
    In addition, Applied incurred charges totaling $486 million
    that included a plan to restructure its Energy and Environmental
    Solutions segment. This action was in response to adverse market
    conditions for thin film solar, including delays in
    utility-scale solar adoption, solar panel manufacturers’
    challenges in obtaining affordable capital, changes and
    uncertainty in government renewable energy policies, and
    competitive pressure from c-Si solar technologies. As part of
    the restructuring, Applied discontinued sales to new customers
    of its fully-integrated SunFab lines but continued to offer
    individual tools for thin film solar manufacturing. Applied is
    supporting existing SunFab customers with services, upgrades and
    capacity increases through its Applied Global Services segment
    and will continue RD&E efforts to improve thin film panel
    efficiency and high-productivity deposition.

Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced
    demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely
    unfavorable global economic and industry conditions,
    particularly in the first half of fiscal 2009. Negative trends
    in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty led some
    customers to dramatically reduce factory operations and to
    reduce their spending. In the second half of fiscal 2009, demand
    for semiconductor and display equipment increased, but was still
    down significantly from fiscal 2008 levels. Fiscal 2009
    financial results included charges associated with restructuring
    programs.

Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected decreased demand for
    semiconductor equipment and, to a lesser extent, service
    products, due to unfavorable market conditions in the
    semiconductor industry, partially offset by increased demand for
    LCD and solar products. New orders decreased from fiscal 2007
    due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from memory,
    foundry and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by
    increased demand by LCD customers and, beginning in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008, the initial recognition of orders for
    Applied’s SunFab thin film line for manufacturing solar
    panels. Net sales decreased during fiscal 2008 compared to
    fiscal 2007 due to the decline in investment from memory and
    logic customers, partially offset by increased sales of c-Si
    solar manufacturing products. Net income decreased in fiscal
    2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower net sales, offset in
    part by lower operating expenses. Fiscal 2008 financial results
    included charges associated with restructuring programs.

Applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry
    conditions in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. As a result of these
    conditions and the changing global economic environment, there
    were significant fluctuations in Applied’s quarterly new
    orders and net sales, both within and across the three fiscal
    years. Demand for manufacturing equipment has historically been
    volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip, LCD and solar PV
    supply and demand and other factors, including global economic
    and market conditions and rapid technological advances in
    fabrication processes.

New orders more than doubled to $10.2 billion in fiscal
    2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase was principally due
    to greater demand for semiconductor equipment and services,
    primarily from memory and foundry customers, as well as
    increased demand for c-Si solar manufacturing products and
    display equipment. The increase in new orders reflected the
    general recovery in the semiconductor equipment industry and the
    LCD market from the steep downturn experienced in fiscal 2009.

New orders decreased 55 percent to $4.1 billion in
    fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders
    was across all segments, and particularly in the semiconductor
    and display businesses, reflecting the challenging economic and
    industry conditions prevalent during fiscal 2009. Customer
    demand for semiconductor and LCD equipment began to recover in
    the second half of fiscal 2009.

New orders decreased 5 percent to $9.2 billion in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to lower demand for
    semiconductor equipment from logic, memory, and foundry chip
    manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand for LCD and
    solar equipment, including the initial recognition of orders for
    the Applied SunFab thin film line. Demand for LCD equipment
    slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as
    Display customers absorbed capacity following robust demand over
    the preceding three quarters.

Applied’s backlog as of the end of each of the last three
    fiscal years was as follows: $3.2 billion at
    October 31, 2010, $2.7 billion at October 25,
    2009, and $4.8 billion at October 26, 2008. Backlog
    increased in fiscal 2010 primarily due to an increase in new
    orders for Silicon Systems Group and Applied Global Services
    reflecting increased demand for semiconductor equipment. Backlog
    consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations
    have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the
    next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has
    not been recognized; (2) contractual service revenue and
    maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months;
    and (3) orders for SunFab lines that are anticipated to be
    recognized as revenue within the next 12 months.
    Applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily
    indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the
    potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or
    cancellation of orders. In addition, the majority of sales in
    the largest business segment were from orders received and
    shipped in the same quarter.

Net sales of $9.5 billion for fiscal 2010 increased
    90 percent from fiscal 2009, primarily due to higher sales
    of semiconductor equipment. Net sales decreased 38 percent
    to $5.0 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, as
    a result of significantly lower sales of equipment and services
    to semiconductor and display customers, partially offset by
    increased sales of solar manufacturing equipment. Net sales
    decreased 16 percent to $8.1 billion in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007, due to decreased investment from memory
    and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased
    demand from solar and LCD customers.

The increase in the gross margin as a percentage of net sales in
    fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 was principally attributable to
    higher net sales, more favorable product mix, improved factory
    utilization, and continued cost control measures, offset in part
    by inventory-related charges of $330 million associated
    with SunFab thin film solar equipment. These inventory-related
    charges lowered gross margin for fiscal 2010 by approximately
    3 percentage points. The decrease in the gross margin
    percentage in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was due to lower net
    sales, lower-margin product mix, and reduced factory absorption,
    offset in part by cost control initiatives. Gross margin during
    fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 included $32 million,
    $28 million and $32 million, respectively, of
    share-based compensation expense.

Applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable
    extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the
    equipment and service products it provides. Applied believes
    that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments
    in RD&E to assure the availability of innovative technology
    that meets the current and



projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced
    designs. Applied historically has maintained its commitment to
    investing in RD&E in order to continue to offer new
    products and technologies. RD&E expenses were
    $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2010,
    $934 million (19 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2009
    and $1.1 billion (14 percent of net sales) in fiscal
    2008. RD&E expense during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008
    included $43 million, $50 million and
    $59 million, respectively, of share-based compensation
    expense. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months
    depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an
    existing product, which typically has a shorter development
    cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer
    development cycle. Most of Applied’s existing products
    resulted from internal development activities and innovations
    involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain
    instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or
    new product areas, to complement its existing technology
    capabilities and to reduce time to market.

In fiscal 2010, Applied developed new technology to enable
    next-generation 22nm and below chip designs. These systems were
    designed to help customers continue their drive to pack more
    transistors in the same space using using high-k/metal gate
    technologies and double patterning processes. Applied also
    developed technology for through-silicon vias (TSVs), an
    emerging solution for interconnecting three dimensional chip
    stacks to provide better device performance, lower power
    consumption and the integration of heterogeneous devices. In the
    solar PV area, Applied continued the development of its
    precision wafering and cell manufacturing products for lowering
    the cost of producing solar-generated electricity through
    advanced crystalline silicon technology.

In fiscal 2009, Applied focused on developing systems for
    semiconductor customers’ new chip designs with 32nm and
    below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors
    using strain engineering and high-k/metal gate technologies, as
    well as double patterning processes that enable customers to
    extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through additional
    technology generations. Applied also focused on developing
    technology for manufacturing next generation displays. RD&E
    also included activities to develop products that enable
    lower-cost production of solar energy and other products to
    enable energy conservation.

In fiscal 2008, Applied focused on the development of processes
    and systems for the continued scaling of semiconductor devices.
    Applied pioneered a self-aligned double patterning approach that
    can enable 22nm and below device fabrication using conventional
    optical lithography. The Company also developed technology for
    the implementation of through-silicon vias. Efforts were also
    focused on developing the systems and technology to reduce the

cost-per-watt

of solar electricity.

The increase in marketing, selling, general and administrative
    expenses in fiscal 2010 from fiscal 2009 reflected the
    elimination of temporary salary reductions and shutdowns, and
    the resumption of variable compensation programs. The decrease
    in marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses in
    fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily due to cost control
    initiatives. Marketing, selling, general and administrative
    expenses were 10 percent of net sales in fiscal 2010,
    15 percent of net sales in fiscal 2009, and 12 percent
    of net sales in fiscal 2008. Marketing, selling and general and
    administrative expenses during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008
    included $51 million, $69 million and
    $88 million, respectively, of share-based compensation

During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied announced a
    plan to restructure its Energy and Environmental Solutions
    segment. The action, which was expected to impact between 400 to
    500 positions globally, was in response to adverse market
    conditions for thin film solar, including delays in
    utility-scale solar adoption, solar panel



manufacturers’ challenges in obtaining affordable capital,
    changes and uncertainty in government renewable energy polices,
    and competitive pressure from c-Si solar technologies. During
    fiscal 2010, Applied recorded charges related to this plan
    totaling $403 million, which included inventory-related
    charges of $247 million related to SunFab thin film solar
    equipment, asset impairment charges of $108 million,
    employee severance charges of $45 million, and other costs
    of $3 million.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied announced a
    restructuring program to reduce its global workforce as of
    October 25, 2009 by approximately 1,300 to 1,500 positions,
    or 10 to 12 percent, over a period of 18 months.
    During the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied recorded
    restructuring charges of $104 million associated with this
    program. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, as a result of
    changes in business requirements, Applied revised its global
    workforce reduction to approximately 1,000 positions and
    recorded a favorable adjustment of $20 million.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Applied announced a
    restructuring program to reduce its global workforce by
    approximately 1,800 positions. During the second quarter of
    fiscal 2009, Applied expanded the scope of the restructuring
    program by approximately 200 positions. During fiscal 2009,
    Applied recorded restructuring charges of $143 million
    associated with this program. The restructuring charges
    consisted of employee-related costs to reduce the Company’s
    workforce through a combination of attrition, voluntary
    separation and other workforce reduction programs. In addition,
    Applied determined that the carrying value of certain fixed
    assets to be sold exceeded the estimated fair value and, as a
    result, recorded a $15 million impairment charge.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied announced a
    global cost reduction plan that primarily affected its Silicon
    Systems Group and Applied Global Services segments and related
    support organizations. As part of this plan, Applied reduced its
    global workforce through a combination of job elimination and
    attrition. For fiscal 2008, Applied recorded restructuring
    charges of $29 million relating to this plan, consisting
    primarily of employee related costs to reduce its workforce. The
    affected employees were based in North America, Europe and Asia,
    and represented multiple functions.

The change in the fiscal 2010 tax rate from the fiscal 2009 rate
    was principally attributable to the income before taxes for
    fiscal 2010 as opposed to the net loss before taxes incurred in
    fiscal 2009. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2010 did
    not include the impact of the U.S. R&D tax credit from
    the time it expired in December 2009. In the event the
    U.S. R&D tax credit is enacted on a retroactive basis,
    there would be a favorable impact to Applied’s effective
    income tax rate in the period enacted. The change in the fiscal
    2009 tax rate from the fiscal 2008 rate was



principally attributable to the net loss before taxes incurred
    in fiscal 2009. Applied’s effective income tax rate depends
    on various factors, such as tax legislation, and the geographic
    composition of Applied’s pre-tax income.

Segment
    Information

Applied reports financial results in four segments: Silicon
    Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and
    Environmental Solutions. A description of the products and
    services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment
    can be found in Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed
    Financial Statements. Applied does not allocate to its
    reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages
    separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs
    include costs for share-based compensation; certain management,
    finance, legal, human resources, and RD&E functions
    provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information
    technology and occupancy. In addition, Applied does not allocate
    to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment
    charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring
    actions, unless these charges or adjustments pertain to a
    specific reportable segment.

Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied changed
    its methodology for allocating certain expenses to its
    reportable segments, such as components of variable compensation
    and operating expenses associated with the global sales
    organization. Applied has reclassified segment operating results
    for fiscal 2009 and 2008 to conform to the fiscal 2010
    presentation.

The results for each reportable segment are discussed below.

Silicon
    Systems Group Segment

The Silicon Systems Group segment includes semiconductor capital
    equipment for deposition, etch, rapid thermal processing,
    chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, and
    wafer packaging. Development efforts are focused on solving
    customers’ key technical challenges, including transistor
    performance and nanoscale patterning, and improving chip
    manufacturing productivity to reduce costs.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years

Fiscal 2010 financial results reflected increased demand for
    manufacturing equipment over fiscal 2009 due to improved global
    economic and industry conditions. New orders increased by
    $4.1 billion to $5.8 billion for fiscal 2010 compared
    to fiscal 2009. The significant increase in new orders was
    primarily from memory and foundry customers and to a lesser
    extent logic customers, which reflected the general recovery in
    the semiconductor equipment industry. The majority of fiscal
    2010 new orders were for customers’ capacity expansions,
    while fiscal 2009 orders were primarily for customers’ new
    technology investments. Net sales increased by $3.3 billion
    to $5.3 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009.
    The increase in net sales was primarily due to increased
    investment by memory and foundry customers. Four customers
    accounted for 51 percent of net sales in this segment in
    fiscal 2010. Approximately 61 percent of net sales in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 were for orders received and
    shipped within the quarter. The book to bill ratio (new orders
    divided by net sales) increased to 1.1 for fiscal 2010,
    reflecting increased demand, compared to 0.9 for fiscal 2009.
    Operating income increased by $1.7 billion to
    $1.9 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The
    increase in operating income for fiscal 2010 was due to
    considerably higher revenue from semiconductor equipment sales
    and reflected the general recovery in the semiconductor
    equipment industry during fiscal 2010. Results for fiscal 2010
    included Semitool, which was acquired by Applied during the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010. In 2010, Applied introduced its
    Applied Reflexion GT CMP system, for fabricating copper
    interconnects and its Applied Centura
    AdvantEdge

FCVD system, which is targeted for 20nm and below chips,
    delivers a liquid-like film that flows freely into virtually any
    structure to provide void-free dielectric fill.

Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced
    demand for manufacturing equipment due to extremely unfavorable
    global economic and industry conditions. Silicon Systems Group
    new orders decreased 59 percent to $1.7 billion in
    fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders
    reflected significantly lower demand, primarily from memory and
    logic customers. Net sales decreased 51 percent to
    $2.0 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The
    decrease in net sales was due to decreased capital investments,
    primarily by memory customers. The book to bill ratio decreased
    to 0.9 for fiscal 2009, reflecting significantly decreased
    demand, compared to 1.0 for fiscal 2008. Operating income
    decreased 84 percent to $201 million in fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income was
    due to significantly lower sales resulting in lower factory
    absorption, partially offset by lower operating expenses from
    cost control initiatives. Operating income for fiscal 2009 also
    reflected an increase in bad debt expense. After an operating
    loss in the first half of fiscal 2009, the Silicon Systems Group
    returned to operating profitability during the second half of
    the year, which was primarily driven by sales to foundry
    customers. During the year, the Company introduced a new
    platform specifically designed for under-bump metallization
    (UBM) and other back-end processes, the Applied Charger UBM PVD
    system.

Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected reduced demand for
    manufacturing equipment due to less favorable industry
    conditions. Fiscal 2008 Silicon Systems Group new orders
    decreased 38 percent to $4.1 billion compared to
    fiscal 2007. The decrease in new orders was due to reduced
    demand for equipment from logic, memory and foundry customers.
    Net sales decreased 38 percent to $4.0 billion in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in net sales
    was due to decreased investment by logic and memory customers.
    Operating income decreased 48 percent to $1.2 billion
    in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in
    operating income was due to significantly lower revenue levels
    from the slowdown in the semiconductor equipment industry,
    partially offset by lower operating expenses attributable to
    continued focus on cost controls and improvement in
    manufacturing activities. In fiscal 2008, the Company launched
    two products for photomask applications: the Applied Aera2 Mask
    Inspection system, which detects critical defects on a
    photomask, and the Applied Tetra Reticle Clean system, which
    cleans 32nm and below photomasks using wet clean chemistry. The
    Company also introduced the Applied Producer eHARP system for
    depositing films in high aspect ratio device structures.

Applied
    Global Services Segment

The Applied Global Services segment encompasses technically
    differentiated products, including spares, services, certain
    earlier generation equipment products, and remanufactured
    equipment, to improve operating efficiency, reduce operating
    costs, and lessen the environmental impact of semiconductor,
    display and solar customers’ factories. Customer demand for
    products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution
    system with trained service engineers located in close proximity
    to customer sites.

Fiscal 2010 financial results reflected increased demand for
    manufacturing services over fiscal 2009 due to improved global
    economic and industry conditions. New orders increased by
    $1.0 billion to $2.2 billion for fiscal 2010 compared
    to fiscal 2009. The increase in new orders was due primarily to
    higher demand for spare parts and refurbished equipment,
    reflecting customers’ higher factory utilization rates. Net
    sales increased by $468 million to $1.9 billion for
    fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in net sales
    was primarily due to higher sales in spare parts. The book to
    bill ratio increased to 1.2 for fiscal 2010, reflecting
    increased demand, compared to 0.8 for



fiscal 2009. Operating income increased by $222 million to
    $337 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The
    increase in operating income for fiscal 2010 primarily reflected
    increased sales of spare parts.

Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced
    demand for manufacturing services due to extremely unfavorable
    global economic and industry conditions, as well as a
    significant reduction in the installed base of 200mm systems.
    New orders decreased 48 percent to $1.2 billion in
    fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, due primarily to decreased
    demand for spares and refurbished equipment arising from
    semiconductor manufacturers’ low wafer production volumes.
    Net sales decreased 40 percent to $1.4 billion in
    fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, reflecting lower sales of
    spares and refurbished equipment. Operating income decreased
    79 percent to $115 million in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008 as a result of lower sales volumes, which led to
    lower infrastructure cost absorption, partially offset by lower
    operating expenses from cost control initiatives. Operating
    income for fiscal 2009 also included an increase in bad debt
    expense. In the second half of fiscal 2009, the Applied Global
    Services segment returned to operating profitability as sales of
    spares improved. The book to bill ratio decreased to 0.8 for
    fiscal 2009, reflecting significantly decreased demand, compared
    to 1.0 for fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected reduced demand for
    manufacturing services due to less favorable industry
    conditions. Fiscal 2008 results were impacted by lower levels of
    semiconductor and display customers’ factory utilization.
    New orders decreased 10 percent to $2.2 billion in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to lower orders for
    spares, fab-wide services, and refurbished equipment, partially
    offset by increased orders for service and system enhancements.
    Net sales decreased 1 percent to $2.3 billion in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The net sales decrease
    reflected lower sales of fab-wide services and spares, offset by
    increased sales in services and system enhancements. Operating
    income decreased 9 percent to $545 million in fiscal
    2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to higher operating expenses in
    fiscal 2008.

Display
    Segment

The Display segment encompasses products for manufacturing LCDs
    for TVs, personal computers and other video-enabled devices. The
    business is focused on expanding market share by differentiation
    with larger-scale substrates, entry into new markets, and
    development of products to enable cost reductions through
    productivity and uniformity.

Fiscal 2010 operating financial results reflected increased
    demand for LCD equipment over fiscal 2009 due to improved global
    economic and industry conditions. New orders increased by
    $512 million to $799 million for fiscal 2010 compared
    to fiscal 2009. The increase in new orders reflected the general
    recovery in the LCD market, as customers increased production
    levels in response to strong end-demand for flat panel TVs and
    notebook computers. Net sales increased by $397 million to
    $899 million for fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The
    increase in net sales reflected strong market demand for LCD
    products. Five customers accounted for 71 percent of net
    sales for the Display segment in fiscal 2010. The book to bill
    ratio increased to 0.9 for fiscal 2010, reflecting increased
    demand, compared to 0.6 for fiscal 2009. Operating income
    increased by $216 million to $267 million for fiscal
    2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income
    was due to a significant increase in net sales and improved
    gross margin driven by an increase in volume.

Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced
    demand for LCD equipment due to extremely unfavorable global
    economic and industry conditions. New orders decreased
    significantly to $287 million in fiscal 2009 compared to
    $1.5 billion in fiscal 2008, which reflected the slowdown
    in the display industry from fiscal 2008 when display
    manufacturers added capacity. Net sales decreased
    49 percent to $502 million in fiscal 2009 compared



to fiscal 2008 as a result of significantly lower orders.
    Operating income decreased to $51 million in fiscal 2009
    from $301 million in fiscal 2008. Operating income
    decreased due to significantly lower revenue, partially offset
    by lower operating expenses due to cost control initiatives. The
    book to bill ratio decreased to 0.6 for fiscal 2009, reflecting
    significantly decreased demand, compared to 1.5 for fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected increased demand for LCD
    equipment over fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2008, new orders increased
    significantly to $1.5 billion compared to $273 million
    in fiscal 2007. Increased orders were due to substantial
    increases in demand by Display customers in response to strong
    end-product demand. This demand for LCD equipment reached an
    inflection point in the third quarter of fiscal 2008 and
    decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008,
    reflecting the volatility of the display industry. Net sales
    increased 38 percent to $976 million in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007, primarily due to customers’
    investment in Gen-8 products. Operating income increased to
    $301 million in fiscal 2008 from $159 million in
    fiscal 2007. Operating income increased due to higher revenue
    levels, product mix and lower operating costs. In fiscal 2008,
    the Company introduced its Gen-10 systems that can process
    substrates sized at approximately 2.85 x 3.05 meters. These
    systems include the AKT-90K PECVD and AKT-90K EBT products.

Energy
    and Environmental Solutions Segment

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products
    for fabricating thin film and c — Si solar PVs, high
    throughput

roll-to-roll

coating systems for flexible electronics and web products, and
    systems used in the manufacture of energy-efficient glass. This
    business is focused on delivering solutions to generate and
    conserve energy, with an emphasis on lowering the cost to
    produce solar power by providing equipment to enhance
    manufacturing scale and efficiency.

In fiscal 2010, Applied incurred charges of $486 million
    that included a plan to restructure its Energy and Environmental
    Solutions segment as described above and consisted of
    inventory-related charges of $330 million related to SunFab
    thin film solar equipment, asset impairment charges of
    $108 million, employee severance charges of
    $45 million, and other costs of $3 million.

Fiscal 2010 financial results reflected increased demand for
    c-Si products, offset by reduced demand for SunFab thin film
    solar manufacturing lines due to the challenging market
    conditions for utility-scale solar. New orders increased
    58 percent to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to
    fiscal 2009. The increase in orders reflected increased demand
    for c-Si products, particularly wafering and metallization
    products, offset by reduced demand for SunFab lines. Net sales
    increased 28 percent to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2010
    compared to fiscal 2009. Net sales for fiscal 2010 primarily
    reflected higher sales to c-Si customers than in fiscal 2009.
    The relative share of the segment’s net sales attributable
    to SunFab customers decreased to 36 percent in fiscal 2010 from
    44 percent in fiscal 2009. The book to bill ratio increased to
    1.0 for fiscal 2010 compared to 0.8 for fiscal 2009. The
    operating loss in the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment
    increased by $232 million to $466 million for fiscal
    2010 compared to fiscal 2009. The increase in operating loss was
    primarily due to restructuring, asset impairment and
    inventory-related charges of $486 million recognized in the
    second and third quarters of fiscal 2010, and lower net sales to
    SunFab customers, partially offset by increased sales of c-Si
    products and cost control initiatives. Results for the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2010 reflected customer final acceptance of
    two SunFab lines.

Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected reduced demand for c-Si
    products over fiscal 2008 offset in part by higher demand for
    SunFab lines. New orders of $955 million in fiscal 2009
    decreased from $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease in
    new orders was primarily due to decreased demand from c-Si
    customers and reflected the



challenging global economic environment, solar
    manufacturers’ difficulties in obtaining cost-effective
    capital, and a decrease in end demand. Net sales of
    $1.2 billion in fiscal 2009 increased from
    $819 million in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in sales for
    SunFab lines. The operating loss of $234 million in fiscal
    2009 increased from $206 million in fiscal 2008 due to an
    increase in RD&E expenses and unfavorable gross margins
    associated with initial SunFab line

start-ups,

offset in part by cost control initiatives. In 2009, the Company
    introduced its Baccini Esatto Technology, a high precision,
    multi-step printing capability designed to increase the
    efficiency of c-Si solar cells. The book to bill ratio decreased
    to 0.8 for fiscal 2009, reflecting significantly decreased
    demand, compared to 1.6 for fiscal 2008.

Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected increased demand for
    c-Si products over fiscal 2007 and the recognition of orders for
    the SunFab line beginning in fiscal 2008. New orders of
    $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008 increased from
    $245 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in new orders was
    primarily due to the recognition of orders for the SunFab line
    beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as well as growth
    in orders for c-Si products. Net sales of $819 million in
    fiscal 2008 increased from $165 million in fiscal 2007 due
    to customers’ investment in c-Si products from the
    acquisitions of HCT and Baccini, in addition to increased sales
    across all other products in the segment. The increase in net
    sales for fiscal 2008 included the first revenue recognition of
    a SunFab line. The operating loss of $206 million in fiscal
    2008 increased from $89 million in fiscal 2007. The
    increase in operating loss reflected increased RD&E
    spending to develop products that enable lower-cost production
    of solar energy, increased operating costs, amortization of
    acquisition-related costs, and costs related to expansion of
    solar marketing efforts, partially offset by higher revenues.

Subsequent
    Event

On November 29, 2010, Applied entered into a Settlement
    Agreement (the Agreement) with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
    (Samsung). The Agreement resolved potential civil claims and
    removed the risk of civil litigation between the parties
    relating to the alleged acquisition, misappropriation and misuse
    of Samsung confidential semiconductor information in Korea that
    is the subject of criminal proceedings pending against employees
    of several companies, including current and former Applied
    Materials Korea employees, in the Seoul Eastern District Court
    of the Republic of Korea (the Korea proceedings). Neither
    Applied nor any of its subsidiaries is a defendant in the Korea
    proceedings. The settlement terms of the Agreement pertain to
    potential civil claims between the parties and are separate from
    and do not affect criminal proceedings against individual
    defendants, including but not limited to the individuals charged
    in the Korea proceedings.

Under the Agreement, which is generally effective for a
    three-year period starting November 1, 2010, Applied will
    provide volume-based rebates on purchases of semiconductor
    products by Samsung and its affiliated companies. Applied also
    will provide volume-based incentives related to Samsung’s
    use of Applied systems (i) for production of semiconductor
    devices in applications for which Samsung has not previously
    used Applied systems, and (ii) for joint development
    activities. In addition, the Agreement includes volume-based
    credits for certain upgrades, engineering services and spare
    parts. The financial impact of the above rebates and incentives
    on Applied’s consolidated results of operations and
    financial position will depend on the volume of purchases by
    Samsung after the effective date of the Agreement.

Business
    Combinations

On December 21, 2009, Applied acquired Semitool, Inc., a
    public company based in the state of Montana, for a purchase
    price of $323 million in cash, net of cash acquired,
    pursuant to a tender offer and subsequent short-form merger. The
    acquired business is a leading supplier of electrochemical
    plating and wafer surface preparation equipment used by
    semiconductor packaging and manufacturing companies globally.
    Applied’s primary reasons for this acquisition were to
    complement its existing product offerings and to provide
    opportunities for future growth. The acquired business is
    included in results for the Silicon Systems Group segment.

In November 2009, Applied acquired substantially all the assets,
    including the intellectual property, of Advent Solar, a
    developer of advanced technology for c-Si solar photovoltaic
    cells and modules (PVs), for a purchase price of
    $14 million. This acquisition complemented Applied’s
    portfolio of solar PV technologies and enhanced



Applied’s opportunities in the c-Si equipment market. The
    acquisition is included in results for the Energy and
    Environmental Solutions segment.

On January 31, 2008, Applied acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Baccini S.p.A., a privately-held company
    based in Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in
    cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired. The
    acquired business is a leading supplier of automated
    metallization and test systems for manufacturing c-Si
    photovoltaic cells.

On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum,
    Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts
    cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million.

    Financial Statements.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2010, the FASB issued updated authoritative guidance
    that amends the requirements for evaluating whether a decision
    maker or service provider has a variable interest entity and
    clarified that a quantitative approach should not be the sole
    consideration in assessing the criteria for variable interest
    entity determination. The guidance also clarifies that related
    parties should be considered in applying all of the decision
    maker and service provider criteria. This is in addition to the
    authoritative guidance the FASB issued in June 2009 that applies
    to determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity
    and requiring an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine
    whether the enterprise’s variable interest or interests
    give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest
    entity. Under this guidance, an enterprise has a controlling
    financial interest when it has (1) the power to direct the
    activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly
    impact the entity’s economic performance and (2) the
    obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the variable interest entity. The guidance also
    requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit
    financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest
    entity operates as designed when determining whether it has
    power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity
    that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance. The guidance also requires ongoing assessments of
    whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable
    interest entity, requires enhanced disclosures, and eliminates
    the scope exclusion for qualifying special-purpose entities.
    This authoritative guidance is effective for Applied beginning
    in the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The implementation of this
    authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact
    on Applied’s financial position or results of operations.

In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair
    value measurements, which requires additional disclosures and
    clarifications to existing disclosures. This authoritative
    guidance requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the
    amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and
    Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the
    reasons for these transfers. This authoritative guidance also
    requires enhanced disclosure of activity in Level 3 fair
    value measurements. The new disclosures and clarifications of
    existing disclosures for Level 1 and Level 2 fair
    value measurements became effective for Applied in the second
    quarter of fiscal 2010. Disclosures regarding activity within
    Level 3 fair value measurements become effective the first
    interim reporting period after December 15, 2010 and will
    be effective for Applied in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
    Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation
    of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial
    statements. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements for information and related disclosures regarding
    Applied’s fair value measurements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on variable
    interest entities, which requires revised evaluations of whether
    entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing
    assessments of control over such entities, and additional
    disclosures for variable interests. In December 2009, the FASB
    issued authoritative guidance on the financial reporting by
    entities involved with variable interest entities which amends
    previously issued guidance on variable interest entities. The
    amendments in this authoritative guidance replace the
    quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining
    which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial
    interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused
    on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct
    the activities of a variable interest entity that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or
    (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity. This
    authoritative guidance becomes



effective for Applied in fiscal 2011. The implementation of this
    authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact
    on Applied’s financial position or results of operations.

Financial
    Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Applied’s cash, cash equivalents and investments increased
    to $3.9 billion at October 31, 2010 from
    $3.3 billion at October 25, 2009, due primarily to an
    increase in cash generated from operating activities. Applied
    has not undertaken any significant external financing activities
    for several years.

Applied generated cash from operating activities of
    $1.7 billion in fiscal 2010, $333 million in fiscal
    2009, and $1.7 billion in fiscal 2008. The primary sources
    of cash from operating activities for fiscal 2010 were net
    income, as adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges
    including, depreciation, amortization, restructuring and asset
    impairments, share-based compensation, and changes in components
    of working capital. Changes in working capital included thin
    film solar inventory-related charges of $330 million.
    Applied utilized programs to discount letters of credit issued
    by customers of $230 million in fiscal 2010 and
    $299 million in fiscal 2009, and $167 million in
    fiscal 2008. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many
    factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to
    discount the letters of credit and the cost of such
    arrangements. For fiscal 2010, Applied factored accounts
    receivable of $153 million and discounted promissory notes
    of $3 million. For fiscal 2009, Applied factored accounts
    receivable of $39 million and discounted promissory notes
    of $4 million. For fiscal 2008, Applied factored accounts
    receivable of $133 million and discounted promissory notes
    of $6 million. Days sales outstanding were 58 at the end of
    fiscal 2010, 75 days at the end of fiscal 2009, and
    79 days at the end of fiscal 2008. The 2010 reduction in
    the days sales outstanding from the prior year was attributable
    to higher net sales and improved working capital management.
    Applied’s working capital was $3.9 billion at
    October 31, 2010 and $3.7 billion at both
    October 25, 2009 and October 26, 2008. During fiscal
    2010, Applied received a U.S. federal income tax refund of
    approximately $130 million for the carryback of
    Applied’s net operating loss from fiscal 2009 to fiscal
    2005.

Applied used $862 million of cash for investing activities
    in fiscal 2010. Applied generated $113 million of cash from
    investing activities in fiscal 2009 and used $76 million in
    fiscal 2008. Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from
    sales and maturities of investments, totaled $370 million
    in fiscal 2010. Proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled
    $361 million in fiscal 2009 and $405 million in fiscal
    2008. Capital expenditures were $169 million in fiscal
    2010, $248 million in fiscal 2009, and $288 million in
    fiscal 2008. These expenditures were primarily for the
    implementation of an enterprise resource planning software
    system and the construction of a solar R&D/demonstration
    center in Xi’an, China. Capital expenditures for fiscal
    2010 and fiscal 2009 also included investment to construct a
    facility in Singapore.

Investing activities also included investments in technology and
    acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market
    opportunities or emerging technologies. In fiscal 2010, Applied
    acquired Semitool, a public company based in the state of
    Montana, for $323 million, net of cash acquired. During
    fiscal 2008, Applied acquired



all of the outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately-held
    company based in Italy, for a purchase price of
    $215 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities
    acquired. Also in fiscal 2008, Applied purchased certain assets
    from Edwards Vacuum, Inc. consisting of its Kachina
    semiconductor equipment parts cleaning and refurbishment
    business for $19 million. See Note 9 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.

Applied used cash for financing activities in the amount of
    $576 million for fiscal 2010, $281 million for fiscal
    2009, and $1.4 billion for fiscal 2008. Financing
    activities included payment of cash dividends to stockholders
    and issuances and repurchases of common stock. Cash used to
    repurchase shares totaled $350 million in fiscal 2010,
    $23 million in fiscal 2009, and $1.5 billion in fiscal
    2008. In March 2010, Applied’s Board of Directors approved
    a new stock repurchase program authorizing up to
    $2.0 billion in repurchases over the next three years
    ending in March 2013. Proceeds from stock issuances related
    to equity compensation awards were $129 million in fiscal
    2010, $62 million in fiscal 2009, and $401 million in
    fiscal 2008.

During fiscal 2010, Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.07 per share
    each and one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.06 per
    share. The fourth quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share
    declared in fiscal 2010 will be paid on December 15, 2010
    to stockholders of record as of November 24, 2010. During
    fiscal 2009, Applied’s Board of Directors declared four
    quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each
    quarter. During fiscal 2008, Applied’s Board of Directors
    declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06
    per share each. Cash paid in dividends during fiscal 2010, 2009
    and 2008 amounted to $349 million, $320 million and
    $325 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates
    that it will continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis
    in the future, although the declaration and amount of any future
    cash dividend are at the discretion of the Board of Directors
    and will depend on Applied’s financial condition, results
    of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and
    other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends
    are in the best interest of Applied’s stockholders.

Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in
    various currencies of up to $1.1 billion, of which
    $1.0 billion is comprised of a

5-year

revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is
    scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for
    borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to
    one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance, and
    includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in
    compliance at October 31, 2010. Remaining credit facilities
    in the amount of approximately $98 million are with
    Japanese banks. Applied’s ability to borrow under these
    facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the
    borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to
    the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese
    yen. No amounts were outstanding under any of the above credit
    facilities at October 31, 2010.

In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 31, 2010, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee agreements was
    $54 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in
    connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required
    to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being
    guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical
    experience and information currently available, that it is
    probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under
    these guarantee agreements.

Applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of
    investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury
    and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and
    mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity
    securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its
    investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may
    include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks
    prudently in accordance with its investment policies.

In fiscal 2010, as part of its regular investment review
    process, Applied recorded impairment charges of $13 million
    associated with equity investments in privately-held companies.
    At October 31, 2010, Applied had a gross unrealized loss in
    its investment portfolio of $1 million due to a decrease in
    the fair value of certain fixed income securities. Applied
    regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and
    evaluate investments that have indications of possible
    impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is
    temporary include: the length of time and extent to which fair
    value has been lower than the cost basis; the financial
    condition, credit quality and near-term prospects of the
    investee; and whether it is more

likely-than-not

that Applied will be required to sell the security prior to any
    anticipated recovery in fair value. Generally, the contractual
    terms of the investments



do not permit settlement at prices less than the amortized cost
    of the investments. While Applied cannot predict future market
    conditions or market liquidity, Applied believes that its
    investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the
    risks in its investment portfolio.

During fiscal 2010 and fiscal 2009, Applied recorded bad debt
    provisions, net of recoveries, of $10 million and
    $62 million, respectively, as a result of certain
    customers’ deteriorating financial condition. While Applied
    believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at
    October 31, 2010 is adequate, it will continue to closely
    monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.

Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing
    and extent of factors such as those discussed above,
    Applied’s management believes that cash generated from
    operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing
    cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to
    satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next
    12 months. For further details regarding Applied’s
    operating, investing and financing activities, see the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 31, 2010, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee agreements was
    $54 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in
    connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required
    to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being
    guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical
    experience and information currently available, that it is
    probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under
    these guarantee agreements.

Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total
    rental expense for operating leases was $52 million for
    fiscal 2010, $64 million for fiscal 2009, and
    $68 million for fiscal 2008.

Represents Applied’s agreements to purchase goods and
    services consisting of Applied’s (a) outstanding
    purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual
    requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied
    does not take delivery of the contracted goods.

In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, the
    Company has certain tax obligations. Gross interest and
    penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to
    result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been
    reported as non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. As of October 31, 2010, the gross liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits was $328 million, exclusive of
    interest and penalties. Increases or decreases to interest and
    penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision
    for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
    Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were
    $6 million as of October 31, 2010 and $5 million
    as of October 25, 2009. All $6 million in interest and
    penalties is classified as long-term payable in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. At this time, the Company is unable to make a



reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in
    individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit
    outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not included in the
    above contractual obligation table.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related
    disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
    amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in
    the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
    Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered
    to be critical accounting policies.

A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both
    material to the presentation of Applied’s consolidated
    financial statements and that requires management to make
    difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a
    material effect on Applied’s financial condition or results
    of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following
    attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions
    about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the
    estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could
    reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are
    reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on
    Applied’s financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects
    cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates
    on historical experience and on various other assumptions
    believed to be applicable and reasonable under the
    circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur,
    as additional information is obtained and as Applied’s
    operating environment changes. These changes have historically
    been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management
    is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which
    are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged
    periods of time. These uncertainties include those discussed in
    Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Based on a
    critical assessment of its accounting policies and the
    underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application
    of those policies, management believes that Applied’s
    consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation
    of Applied’s financial condition and results of operations.

Management believes that the following are critical accounting
    policies:

Revenue
    Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition
    criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
    seller’s price to buyer is fixed or determinable; and
    collectability is probable. Each sale arrangement may contain
    commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. In
    addition, Applied frequently enters into contracts that contain
    multiple deliverables. Judgment is required to properly identify
    the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions
    and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated
    among the accounting units. Moreover, judgment is used in
    interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all
    criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for
    revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting
    period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated sales
    price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount
    of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement,
    any material changes in these allocations could impact the
    timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material
    effect on Applied’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

In 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued amended
    revenue recognition guidance for arrangements with multiple
    deliverables and certain software sold with tangible products.
    This new guidance eliminates the residual method of revenue
    recognition and allows the use of management’s best
    estimate of selling price for individual elements of an
    arrangement when vendor specific evidence or third party
    evidence is unavailable. Applied implemented this guidance
    prospectively beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 for
    transactions that were initiated or materially modified during
    fiscal 2010. The implementation of the new guidance had an
    insignificant impact on reported net sales as compared to net
    sales under previous guidance, as the new guidance did not
    change the units of accounting within sales arrangements and the
    elimination of the residual method for the allocation of
    arrangement consideration had an inconsequential impact on the
    amount and timing of reported net sales.



Warranty
    Costs

Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue
    is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by
    analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration
    statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied’s
    warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure
    rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting
    product failures during the warranty period. As Applied’s
    customer engineers and process support engineers are highly
    trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a
    significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and
    availability of critical replacement parts is another
    significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen
    component failures or exceptional component performance can also
    result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs
    differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to
    the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could
    have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
    to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical
    experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection
    history and any customer-specific issues Applied has identified.
    Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse
    change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial
    obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied
    to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts
    due to Applied, which could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Inventory
    Valuation

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market,
    with cost determined on a

first-in,

first-out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for
    estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and
    the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
    demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for
    potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing
    historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are
    evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known
    and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If
    actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated,
    additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be
    required, which could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also
    annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives
    for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology,
    are generally recorded in connection with a business
    acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually
    based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the
    success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If
    actual product acceptance differs significantly from the
    estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment
    charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its
    realizable value. The fair value of a reporting unit is
    estimated using both the income approach and the market approach
    taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating
    results and estimated cost of capital. Management uses
    significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential
    impairment, especially in emerging markets. A severe decline in
    market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for
    impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Income
    Taxes

The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
    composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing
    each region, non-tax deductible expenses incurred in connection
    with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management
    carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the
    effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ
    from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a



valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its
    effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax
    assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect
    of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of
    recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a
    valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion
    of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has
    determined that it is more likely than not that Applied’s
    future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred
    tax assets.

The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment
    in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of
    complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
    inconsistent with Applied’s expectations could have a
    material impact on Applied’s results of operations and
    financial condition.

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Applied’s investment portfolio includes fixed-income
    securities with a fair value of approximately $2.0 billion
    at October 31, 2010. These securities are subject to
    interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates
    increase. Based on Applied’s investment portfolio at
    October 31, 2010, an immediate 100 basis point
    increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the
    fair value of the portfolio of approximately $25 million.
    While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of
    the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in
    the consolidated condensed statement of operations unless the
    individual fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery or
    the loss is determined to be

other-than-temporary.

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign
    currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel,
    Taiwanese dollar and Swiss franc. Applied enters into currency
    forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of, but
    not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated
    transactions expected to occur within 24 months. Gains and
    losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at
    the time that the related transactions being hedged are
    recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange
    rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts
    generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items
    being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to
    subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from
    changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use
    derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
    purposes. Net foreign currency gains and losses were not
    material for fiscal 2010.

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based
    upon that evaluation, Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer concluded that Applied’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
    period covered by this report in ensuring that information
    required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that
    information required to be disclosed by Applied in such reports
    is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
    management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.



Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Applied’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, management of Applied conducted an
    evaluation of the effectiveness of Applied’s internal
    control over financial reporting based upon the framework in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, Applied’s
    management concluded that Applied’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2010.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
    audited the consolidated financial statements included in this

Form 10-K

and, as part of the audit, has issued a report, included herein,
    on the effectiveness of Applied’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of October 31, 2010.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, there were no changes
    in the internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
    Applied’s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be
    met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in
    part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited Applied Materials, Inc.’s (the Company)
    internal control over financial reporting as of October 31,
    2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control -
    Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The
    Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Applied Materials, Inc. maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of October 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Applied Materials Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of October 31, 2010 and October 25,
    2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    October 31, 2010. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the
    financial statement schedule II. Our report dated
    December 10, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule.

Applied has the following equity compensation plans that have
    not been approved by stockholders:

2000 Global Equity Incentive Plan

The 2000 Global Equity
    Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan) was adopted effective as of
    June 21, 2000. The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of
    non-qualified stock options to employees other than officers and
    directors. The administrator of the 2000 Plan (either the Board
    of Directors of Applied or a committee appointed by the Board)
    determines the terms and conditions of all stock options
    granted; provided, however, that (1) the exercise price
    generally may not be less than 100 percent of the fair
    market value (on the date of grant) of the stock covered by the
    option, and (2) the term of options can be no longer than
    10 years (or 13 years in the event of death). A total
    of 147,000,000 shares have been authorized for issuance
    under the 2000 Plan, and 57,201,000 shares remain available
    for issuance as of October 31, 2010.

Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees

The Stock
    Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees (the Offshore ESPP) was
    adopted effective as of October 16, 1995 for the benefit of
    employees of Applied’s participating affiliates (other than
    United States citizens or residents). The Offshore ESPP provides
    for the grant of options to purchase shares of Applied common
    stock through payroll deductions pursuant to one or more
    offerings. The administrator of the Offshore ESPP (the Board of
    Directors of Applied or a committee appointed by the Board)
    determines the terms and conditions of all options prior to the
    start of an offering, including the purchase price of shares,
    the number of shares covered by the option and when the option
    may be exercised. All options granted as part of an offering
    must be granted on the same date. Prior to December 7,



2009, a total of 15,800,000 shares had been authorized for
    issuance under the Offshore ESPP. Effective December 7,
    2009, Applied amended the Offshore ESPP to increase the number
    of shares available for issuance under such plan by
    5,000,000 shares and correspondingly amended the
    stockholder-approved Applied Materials, Inc. Employees’
    Stock Purchase Plan (the U.S. ESPP) to reduce the number of
    shares available for issuance under such plan by
    5,000,000 shares. Accordingly, as of October 31, 2010
    a total of 20,800,000 shares have been authorized for
    issuance under the Offshore ESPP, and 5,315,000 shares
    remain available for issuance. These plan amendments did not
    result in any increase in the total aggregate number of shares
    authorized for issuance under the Offshore ESPP and the
    U.S. ESPP.

Nonemployee Director Share Purchase Plan

The Applied
    Materials, Inc. Nonemployee Director Share Purchase Plan was
    adopted effective March 22, 2005. The Nonemployee Director
    Share Purchase Plan provides a method by which non-employee
    directors may purchase Applied common stock at 100% of fair
    market value on the purchase date by foregoing cash they have
    earned as retainer fees or meeting fees. The shares generally
    are purchased at the same time the directors otherwise would
    have been paid the fees in cash. Since the directors pay full
    fair market value for the shares, there is no reserved amount of
    shares under this plan and, accordingly, the table above does
    not include any set number of shares available for future
    issuance under the plan.

Applied Materials Profit Sharing Scheme

The Applied
    Materials Profit Sharing Scheme was adopted effective
    July 3, 1996 to enable employees of Applied Materials
    Ireland Limited and its participating subsidiaries to purchase
    Applied common stock at 100% of fair market value on the
    purchase date. Under this plan, eligible employees may elect to
    forego a certain portion of their base salary and certain
    bonuses they have earned and that otherwise would be payable in
    cash to purchase shares of Applied common stock at full fair
    market value. Since the eligible employees pay full fair market
    value for the shares, there is no reserved amount of shares
    under this plan and, accordingly, the table above does not
    include any set number of shares available for future issuance
    under the plan.

Item 13:

Certain
    Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director
    Independence

The information appearing in the Proxy Statement under the
    heading “Certain Relationships and Related
    Transactions” is incorporated herein by reference.

The information appearing in the Proxy Statement under the
    heading “Director Independence” is incorporated herein

Item 14:

Principal
    Accounting Fees and Services

Information regarding principal accounting fees and services and
    the audit committee’s preapproval policies and procedures
    appears in the Proxy Statement under the headings “Fees
    Paid to KPMG LLP” and “Policy on Audit
    Committee’s Pre-Approval of Audit and Permisssible
    Non-audit Services of Independent Registered Public Accounting

APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Applied Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied or the
    Company) after elimination of intercompany balances and
    transactions. All references to a fiscal year apply to
    Applied’s fiscal year which ends on the last Sunday in
    October. Fiscal 2010 contained 53 weeks, while fiscal 2009
    and 2008 contained 52 weeks each. The first quarter of
    fiscal 2010 contained 14 weeks, while the second, third,
    and fourth quarters of fiscal 2010 contained 13 weeks. Each
    fiscal quarter of 2009 and 2008 contained 13 weeks.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make judgments, estimates and
    assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    materially from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, Applied
    evaluates its estimates, including those related to accounts
    receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial
    instruments, inventories, intangible assets and goodwill, useful
    lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair
    values of share-based awards, and income taxes, among others.
    Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on
    various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable,
    the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
    the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

Cash
    Equivalents

All highly-liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three
    months or less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. Cash equivalents consists primarily of investments
    in institutional money market funds.

Investments

All of Applied’s investments are classified as

available-for-sale

at the respective balance sheet dates. Investments classified as

available-for-sale

are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and
    any temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an
    investment is presented as a separate component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss). The specific identification
    method is used to determine the gains and losses on investments.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
    determined on a

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis. Applied adjusts inventory carrying value
    for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the
    cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon
    assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Applied
    fully reserves for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders
    for inventory deemed obsolete. Applied performs periodic reviews
    of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by
    comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent
    historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand.
    If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market
    conditions become less favorable than those projected by
    Applied, additional inventory adjustments may be required.
    During fiscal 2010, Applied incurred inventory-related charges,
    including $330 million associated with SunFab thin film
    solar equipment.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is
    provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the
    straight-line method. Estimated useful lives for financial
    reporting purposes are as follows:



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

buildings and improvements, 3 to 30 years; demonstration
    and manufacturing equipment, 3 to 5 years; software, 3 to
    5 years; and furniture, fixtures and other equipment, 3 to
    15 years. Land improvements are amortized over the shorter
    of 15 years or the estimated useful life. Leasehold
    improvements are amortized over the shorter of five years or the
    lease term.

Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are
    reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of
    each fiscal year. Purchased technology and other intangible
    assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization,
    and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to
    15 years using the straight-line method.

Long-Lived
    Assets

Applied reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    these assets may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these
    assets for impairment based on estimated future cash flows from
    these assets.

Business
    Combinations

Effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied adopted
    revised authoritative guidance on business combinations that
    covers the measurement of acquirer shares issued as
    consideration for a business combination, the recognition of
    contingent consideration, the accounting for preacquisition gain
    and loss contingencies, the recognition of capitalized
    in-process research and development, the accounting for
    acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment
    of acquisition-related transaction costs, and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    This authoritative guidance also revised the accounting for both
    increases and decreases in a parent’s controlling ownership
    interest.

Research,
    Development and Engineering Costs

Research, development and engineering costs are expensed as
    incurred.

Sales and
    Value Added Taxes

Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense is based on pretax earnings. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax
    bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses
    and tax credit carryforwards.

Revenue
    Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition
    criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
    seller’s price to buyer is fixed or determinable; and
    collectability is probable. Applied’s shipping terms are
    customarily FOB Applied shipping point or equivalent terms.
    Applied’s revenue recognition policy generally results in
    revenue recognition at the following points: (1) for all
    transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon
    shipment, Applied recognizes revenue upon shipment for all
    products that have been demonstrated to meet product
    specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue
    associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred,
    and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the
    installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not
    been demonstrated to meet product



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at
    customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions where
    legal title does not pass at shipment, revenue is recognized
    when legal title passes to the customer, which is generally at
    customer technical acceptance; (4

)

for arrangements
    initiated prior to fiscal 2010 containing multiple elements, the
    revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred at
    their estimated relative fair values until delivery of the
    deferred elements; and (5) for arrangements initiated or
    materially modified during fiscal 2010 containing multiple
    elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is
    deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing
    estimated sales prices until delivery of the deferred elements.
    Applied limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered
    elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future
    delivery of products or services, future performance obligations
    or subject to customer-specified return or adjustment. In cases
    where Applied has sold products that have been demonstrated to
    meet product specifications prior to shipment, Applied believes
    that at the time of delivery, it has an enforceable claim to
    amounts recognized as revenue. The completed contract method is
    used for
    SunFab

tm

thin film lines. Certain SunFab thin film contracts have
    provisions for additional amounts to become due to Applied if
    the line achieves certain output criteria subsequent to factory
    acceptance. Any additional amounts earned under these contracts
    are recognized upon achievement of such criteria. Spare parts
    revenue is generally recognized upon shipment, and services
    revenue is generally recognized over the period that the
    services are provided.

In the first quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied elected to early
    adopt amended accounting standards issued by the Financial
    Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for multiple deliverable
    revenue arrangements on a prospective basis for applicable
    transactions originating or materially modified after
    October 25, 2009. The new standard changes the requirements
    for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple
    element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement
    consideration to each deliverable to be based on the relative
    selling price. The FASB also amended the accounting standards
    for revenue recognition to exclude software that is contained in
    a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance
    when the software is essential to the tangible product’s
    functionality. Implementation of this new authoritative guidance
    had an insignificant impact on reported net sales as compared to
    net sales under previous guidance, as the new guidance did not
    change the units of accounting within sales arrangements and the
    elimination of the residual method for the allocation of
    arrangement consideration had an inconsequential impact on the
    amount and timing of reported net sales.

For fiscal 2010 and future periods, when a sales arrangement
    contains multiple elements, such as hardware and services

and/or

software products, Applied allocates revenue to each element
    based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a
    deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence
    (VSOE) if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not
    available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor
    TPE is available. Applied generally utilizes the ESP due to the
    nature of its products. In multiple element arrangements where

more-than-incidental

software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each
    separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software
    deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using
    the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the
    arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy.
    If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable,
    the arrangement consideration allocated to the software
    deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software
    deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue,
    as amended.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Applied uses financial instruments, such as forward exchange and
    currency option contracts, to hedge a portion of, but not all,
    existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated
    transactions typically expected to occur within 24 months.
    The terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are
    generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being
    hedged. The purpose of Applied’s foreign currency
    management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate
    fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues,
    costs and eventual cash flows. All of Applied’s derivative
    financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon
    quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative
    instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions, the
    effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is
    reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) in stockholders’ equity, and is reclassified
    into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If
    the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of
    any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the
    associated financial instrument is recorded promptly in
    earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing
    foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or
    loss on these hedges is recorded promptly in earnings to offset
    the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being
    hedged. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments
    for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

As of October 31, 2010, primarily all of Applied’s
    subsidiaries use the United States dollar as their functional
    currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these
    subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at
    the end of the period, except for non-monetary assets, such as
    inventories and property, plant and equipment, which are
    translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs
    are translated using average exchange rates for the period,
    except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are
    translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting
    translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations as incurred.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject Applied to
    significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
    cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable and
    derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.
    Applied invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as,
    but not limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate and
    municipal bonds, United States Treasury and agency securities,
    and asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, and, by policy,
    limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial
    institution or commercial issuer. Applied performs ongoing
    credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition
    and generally requires no collateral to secure accounts
    receivable. Applied maintains an allowance reserve for
    potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on its
    assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable. Applied
    regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as
    historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts
    receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may
    affect a customer’s ability to pay. In addition, Applied
    utilizes letters of credit to mitigate credit risk when
    considered appropriate. Applied is exposed to credit-related
    losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to
    derivative financial instruments, but does not expect any
    counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In March 2010, the FASB issued updated authoritative guidance
    that amends the requirements for evaluating whether a decision
    maker or service provider has a variable interest entity and
    clarified that a quantitative approach should not be the sole
    consideration in assessing the criteria for variable interest
    entity determination. The guidance also clarifies that related
    parties should be considered in applying all of the decision
    maker and service provider criteria. This is in addition to the
    authoritative guidance the FASB issued in June 2009 that applies
    to determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity
    and requiring an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine
    whether the enterprise’s variable interest or interests
    give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest
    entity. Under this guidance, an enterprise has a controlling
    financial interest when it has (1) the power to direct the
    activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly
    impact the entity’s economic performance and (2) the
    obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to
    receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be
    significant to the variable interest entity. The guidance also
    requires an enterprise to assess whether it has an implicit
    financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest
    entity operates as designed when determining whether it has
    power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity
    that most significantly impact the entity’s economic
    performance. The guidance also requires ongoing assessments of
    whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable
    interest entity, requires enhanced disclosures, and eliminates
    the scope exclusion for qualifying special-purpose



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

entities. This guidance is effective for Applied beginning in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2011. The implementation of this
    authoritative guidance is not expected to have a material impact
    on Applied’s financial position or results of operations.

In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair
    value measurements, which requires additional disclosures and
    clarifications to existing disclosures. This authoritative
    guidance requires a reporting entity to disclose separately the
    amounts of significant transfers in and out of Level 1 and
    Level 2 fair value measurements and also to describe the
    reasons for these transfers. This authoritative guidance also
    requires enhanced disclosure of activity in Level 3 fair
    value measurements. The new disclosures and clarifications of
    existing disclosures for Level 1 and Level 2 fair
    value measurements became effective for Applied in the second
    quarter of fiscal 2010. Disclosures regarding activity within
    Level 3 fair value measurements become effective the first
    interim reporting period after December 15, 2010 and will
    be effective for Applied in the second quarter of fiscal 2011.
    Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation
    of this authoritative guidance on its consolidated financial
    statements. See Note 4 for information and related
    disclosures regarding Applied’s fair value measurements.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on variable
    interest entities, which requires revised evaluations of whether
    entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing
    assessments of control over such entities, and additional
    disclosures for variable interests. In December 2009, the FASB
    issued authoritative guidance on the financial reporting by
    entities involved with variable interest entities which amends
    previously issued guidance on variable interest entities. The
    amendments in this authoritative guidance replace the
    quantitative-based risks and rewards calculation for determining
    which reporting entity, if any, has a controlling financial
    interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused
    on identifying which reporting entity has the power to direct
    the activities of a variable interest entity that most
    significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and
    (1) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or
    (2) the right to receive benefits from the entity. This
    authoritative guidance becomes effective for Applied in fiscal
    2011. The implementation of this authoritative guidance is not
    expected to have a material impact on Applied’s financial
    position or results of operations.

Note 2

Earnings
    (Loss) Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share is determined using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted
    average number of common shares and potential common shares
    (representing the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted
    stock units, and employee stock purchase plans shares)
    outstanding during the period. Applied’s net income (loss)
    has not been adjusted for any period presented for purposes of
    computing basic or diluted earnings (loss) per share due to the
    Company’s non-complex capital structure. For purposes of
    computing diluted earnings per share, weighted average potential
    common shares do not include stock options with an exercise
    price greater than the average fair market value of Applied
    common stock for the period as the effect would be
    anti-dilutive. Potential common shares have not been included in
    the calculation of diluted net loss per share for the fiscal
    year ended October 25, 2009 as



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the effect would be anti-dilutive. As such, the numerator and
    the denominator used in computing both basic and diluted net
    loss per share for the fiscal year ended October 25, 2009
    are the same.

At October 31, 2010, Applied had a gross unrealized loss of
    $1 million due to a decrease in the fair value of certain
    fixed income securities. Applied regularly reviews its
    investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that
    have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in
    determining whether an unrealized loss is temporary, or

other-than-temporary

and therefore impaired, include: the length of time and extent
    to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis; the
    financial condition, credit quality and near-term prospects of
    the investee; and whether it is more likely than not that
    Applied will be required to sell the security prior to recovery.
    Generally, the contractual terms of investments in marketable
    securities do not permit settlement at prices less than the
    amortized cost of the investments. Applied has determined that
    the gross unrealized losses on its marketable securities at
    October 31, 2010 are temporary in nature and therefore it
    did not recognize any impairment of its marketable securities
    for fiscal 2010. During fiscal 2010, Applied determined that
    certain of its equity investments in privately-held companies
    were

other-than-temporarily

impaired and, accordingly, recognized impairment charges in the
    amounts of $13 million. Impairment charges associated with
    financial assets for fiscal 2009 totaled $84 million,
    consisting of the following: equity method investment,
    $45 million; publicly-traded equity securities,
    $20 million; equity investments in privately-held
    companies, $17 million; and marketable securities
    $2 million. Applied did not recognize any impairment of its
    financial assets for fiscal 2008.

The following table provides the fair market value of
    Applied’s investments with unrealized losses that are not

Fair
    Value Measurements

Applied’s financial assets are measured and recorded at
    fair value, except for equity investments held in privately-held
    companies. These equity investments are generally accounted for
    under the cost method of accounting and are periodically
    assessed for

other-than-temporary

impairment when events or circumstances indicate that an

other-than-temporary

decline in value may have occurred. Applied’s nonfinancial
    assets, such as



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment,
    are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment when events
    or circumstances indicate that an

other-than-temporary

decline in value may have occurred.

Fair
    Value Hierarchy

Applied uses the following fair value hierarchy, which
    prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure
    fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within
    the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available
    and significant to the fair value measurement:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities;

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly,
    such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted
    prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are
    observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
    substantially the full term of the assets or
    liabilities; and

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Applied’s investments are comprised primarily of debt
    securities that are classified as

available-for-sale

and recorded at their fair values. In determining the fair value
    of investments, Applied uses pricing information from pricing
    services that value securities based on quoted market prices and
    models that utilize observable market inputs. In the event a
    fair value estimate is unavailable from a pricing service,
    Applied generally obtains non-binding price quotes from brokers.
    Applied then reviews the information provided by the pricing
    services or brokers to determine the fair value of its
    short-term and long-term investments. In addition, to validate
    pricing information obtained from pricing services, Applied
    periodically performs supplemental analysis on a sample of
    securities. Applied reviews any significant unanticipated
    differences identified through this analysis to determine the
    appropriate fair value.

Investments with remaining effective maturities of
    12 months or less from the balance sheet date are
    classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining
    effective maturities of more than 12 months from the
    balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments. As
    of October 31, 2010, substantially all of Applied’s

available-for-sale,

short-term and long-term investments were recognized at fair
    value that was determined based upon observable inputs.

    value was $238 million. At October 25, 2009, the
    carrying amount of long-term debt was $202 million and the

Note 5

Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with
    certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as
    Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel, Taiwanese dollar and Swiss
    franc. Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as
    forward exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to
    hedge certain forecasted foreign currency denominated
    transactions expected to occur typically within the next
    24 months. The purpose of Applied’s foreign currency
    management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate
    fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues,
    costs and eventual cash flows. The terms of currency instruments
    used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the
    timing of the transactions being hedged. Applied does not use
    derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
    purposes.



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign
    currency exchange contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet
    at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do
    not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective
    portion of any hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All
    of Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded
    at their fair value in other current assets or in accounts
    payable and accrued expenses.

Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and
    documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and
    are typically entered into once per month. Cash flow hedges are
    evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of
    the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI) in
    stockholders’ equity and is reclassified into earnings when
    the hedged transaction affects earnings. The majority of the
    after-tax net income or loss related to derivative instruments
    included in AOCI at October 31, 2010 is expected to be
    reclassified into earnings within 12 months. Changes in the
    fair value of currency forward exchange and option contracts due
    to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of
    effectiveness. Both ineffective hedge amounts and hedge
    components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are
    recognized promptly in earnings. If the transaction being hedged
    is no longer probable to occur, or if a portion of any
    derivative is deemed to be ineffective, Applied promptly
    recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial
    instrument in general and administrative expenses. The amount
    recognized due to discontinuance of cash flow hedges that were
    probable not to occur by the end of the originally specified
    time period was not significant for fiscal 2010 or 2008. The
    amount recognized due to discontinuance of cash flow hedges that
    were probable not to occur by the end of the originally
    specified time period was $25 million for fiscal 2009.

Additionally, forward exchange contracts are generally used to
    hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or
    liabilities. These derivatives are typically entered into once
    per month and are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
    Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are
    recorded promptly in earnings to offset the changes in the fair
    value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

Credit
    Risk Contingent Features

If Applied’s credit rating were to fall below investment
    grade, it would be in violation of credit risk contingent
    provisions of the derivative instruments discussed above, and
    certain counterparties to the derivative instruments could
    request immediate payment on derivative instruments in net
    liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative
    instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that
    were in a net liability position was immaterial as of
    October 31, 2010.

Entering into foreign exchange contracts with banks exposes
    Applied to credit-related losses in the event of the banks’
    nonperformance. However, Applied’s exposure is not
    considered significant.

Applied has agreements with various financial institutions to
    sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from
    selected customers. Applied also discounts letters of credit
    through various financial institutions. Applied sells its
    accounts receivable without recourse. Details of discounted
    letters of credit, factored accounts receivable and discounted
    promissory notes for fiscal years ended October 31, 2010,
    October 25, 2009 and October 26, 2008 were as follows:

Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful
    accounts of $74 million at October 31, 2010 and
    $67 million at October 25, 2009. Applied sells
    principally to manufacturers within the semiconductor, display
    and solar industries. As a result of challenging economic and
    industry conditions, certain of these manufacturers may
    experience difficulties in meeting their obligations in a timely
    manner. While Applied believes that its allowance for doubtful
    accounts is adequate and represents Applied’s best estimate
    at October 31, 2010, Applied will continue to closely
    monitor customer liquidity and other economic conditions, which
    may result in changes to Applied’s estimates regarding
    collectability.

Note 8

Goodwill,
    Purchased Technology and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets

Applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price
    relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through
    established and generally accepted valuation techniques.
    Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the
    acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and
    identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities
    assumed. Applied assigns assets acquired (including goodwill)
    and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the
    date of acquisition. Typically, acquisitions relate to a single
    reporting unit and thus do not require the allocation of
    goodwill to multiple reporting units. If the products obtained
    in an acquisition are assigned to multiple reporting units, the
    goodwill is distributed to the respective reporting units as
    part of the purchase price allocation process.

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful
    lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment
    annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The process
    of evaluating the potential



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires
    significant judgment, especially in emerging markets. Applied
    regularly monitors current business conditions and other factors
    including, but not limited to, adverse industry or economic
    trends, restructuring actions and lower projections of
    profitability that may impact future operating results. For
    goodwill, Applied performs a two-step impairment test. In the
    first step, Applied compares the estimated fair value of each
    reporting unit to its carrying value. Applied’s reporting
    units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in
    Note 17, based on the manner in which Applied operates its
    business and the nature of those operations. Applied determines
    the fair value of each of its reporting units based on a
    weighting of income and market approaches. Under the income
    approach, Applied calculates the fair value of a reporting unit
    based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.
    Estimated future cash flows will be impacted by a number of
    factors including anticipated future operating results,
    estimated cost of capital

and/or

discount rates. Under the market approach, Applied estimates the
    fair value based on market multiples of revenue or earnings for
    comparable companies, as appropriate. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets
    assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further
    testing is performed. If the carrying value of the net assets
    assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the
    reporting unit, then Applied would perform the second step of
    the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value
    of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Applied would then
    allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the
    assets and liabilities of that unit, as if Applied had acquired
    the reporting unit in a business combination, with the fair
    value of the reporting unit being the “purchase
    price.” The excess of the “purchase price” over
    the carrying amounts assigned to assets and liabilities
    represents the implied fair value of goodwill. If Applied
    determined that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s
    goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, Applied would record
    an impairment equal to the difference.

Applied conducted impairment tests in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2010, and the results of the first step of the impairment
    test indicated that Applied’s goodwill and purchased
    intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for each of its
    reporting units were not impaired.

From October 25, 2009 to October 31, 2010, goodwill
    increased by $158 million due to the acquisition of
    Semitool, Inc. (Semitool), and by $7 million due to an
    asset purchase from Advent Solar, Inc. (Advent Solar), both
    during the first quarter of fiscal 2010 (see Note 9). Other
    intangible assets that are not subject to amortization consist
    primarily of a trade name.

Finite-Lived
    Purchased Intangible Assets

Applied amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives
    using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives
    of the assets, ranging from 1 to 15 years.

Applied evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever
    events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value
    of an asset group may not be recoverable. Applied assesses the
    fair value of the assets based on the amount of the undiscounted
    future cash flow that the assets are expected to generate and
    recognizes an impairment



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to
    result from the use of the asset, plus net proceeds expected
    from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the
    carrying value of the asset. When Applied identifies an
    impairment, Applied reduces the carrying value of the group of
    assets to comparable market values, when available and
    appropriate, or to its estimated fair value based on a
    discounted cash flow approach.

Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally
    recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value
    assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and
    judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle
    of products and technology acquired. Applied evaluates the
    useful lives of its intangible assets each reporting period to
    determine whether events and circumstances require revising the
    remaining period of amortization. In addition, Applied reviews
    intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Management considers such indicators as significant
    differences in actual product acceptance from the estimates,
    changes in the competitive and economic environment,
    technological advances, and changes in cost structure.

From October 25, 2009 to October 31, 2010, the change
    in gross carrying amount of the amortized intangible assets was
    approximately $18 million, primarily due the acquisition of
    Semitool during the first quarter of fiscal 2010, offset by
    impairment of intangible assets in connection with restructuring
    of the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2010. Aggregate amortization expense was
    $113 million, $89 million and $121 million for

Business
    Combinations

On December 21, 2009, Applied acquired Semitool, a public
    company based in the state of Montana, for a purchase price of
    $323 million in cash, net of cash acquired, pursuant to a
    tender offer and subsequent short-form merger. The acquired
    business is a leading supplier of electrochemical plating and
    wafer surface preparation equipment used by semiconductor
    packaging and manufacturing companies globally. Applied’s
    primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement its
    existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for
    future growth. The acquired business is included in results for
    the Silicon Systems Group segment.

In November 2009, Applied acquired substantially all the assets,
    including the intellectual property, of Advent Solar, a
    developer of advanced technology for c-Si solar photovoltaic
    cells and modules (PVs), for a purchase price of
    $14 million. This acquisition complemented Applied’s
    portfolio of solar PV technologies and enhanced Applied’s
    opportunities in the c-Si equipment market. The acquisition is
    included in results for the Energy and Environmental Solutions
    segment.

Applied allocated the purchase price of each of these
    acquisitions to tangible assets, liabilities and identifiable
    intangible assets acquired, based on their estimated fair
    values. The excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair
    values was recorded as goodwill. The fair value assigned to
    identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on estimates
    and assumptions made by management. These estimates were
    determined through established and generally accepted
    calculation techniques. Applied calculated the fair value of the
    tangible and intangible assets

On January 31, 2008, Applied acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately-held company based in
    Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of
    cash and marketable securities acquired. The acquired business
    is a leading supplier of automated metallization and test
    systems for manufacturing c-Si photovoltaic cells. In connection
    with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $158 million and intangible assets of $130 million. Of
    the $130 million of acquired intangible assets,
    $61 million was assigned to acquired backlog (to be
    amortized over 2 years), $34 million was assigned to
    customer relationships (to be amortized over 9 years),
    $27 million was assigned to purchased technology (to be
    amortized over 7 years), $6 million was assigned to
    covenants not to compete (to be amortized over 2 years),
    and $3 million was assigned to trademarks and tradenames
    (to be amortized over 7 years). The allocation of the
    purchase price was based on estimates of the fair value of the
    assets acquired. The acquired business is reported under the
    Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.

On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum,
    Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts
    cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. The
    acquisition expanded Applied’s existing Chamber Performance
    Services network of facilities that provide customers worldwide
    with technology and support for maintaining their chamber
    components. In connection with this acquisition, Applied



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

recorded goodwill of $13 million and an intangible asset of
    $3 million (customer relationships, to be amortized over
    13 years). The acquired business is reported under the
    Applied Global Services segment.

For all of the purchase business combinations discussed above,
    the results of operations prior to the acquisition dates were
    not material in relation to those of Applied for any of the
    periods presented herein. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    reviewed periodically for impairment and purchased technology is
    amortized over its useful life of 1 to 15 years.

Borrowing
    Facilities

Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in
    various currencies of up to $1.1 billion, of which
    $1.0 billion is comprised of a

5-year

revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is
    scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for
    borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to
    one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance and
    includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in
    compliance at October 31, 2010. Remaining credit facilities
    in the amount of approximately $98 million are with
    Japanese banks. Applied’s ability to borrow under these
    facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the
    borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to
    the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese
    yen. No amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities
    at October 31, 2010.

conditions for thin film solar, including delays in
    utility-scale solar adoption, solar panel manufacturers’
    challenges in obtaining affordable capital, changes and
    uncertainty in government renewable energy polices, and
    competitive pressure from crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar
    technologies. Under this plan, Applied incurred charges totaling
    $403 million, which included inventory-related charges
    included in cost of products sold of $247 million related
    to SunFab thin film solar equipment, asset impairment charges of
    $108 million, employee severance charges of
    $45 million, and other costs of $3 million.

On November 11, 2009, Applied announced a restructuring
    program to reduce its global workforce as of October 25,
    2009 by approximately 1,300 to 1,500 positions, or 10 to
    12 percent, over a period of 18 months. During the
    first quarter of fiscal 2010, Applied recorded restructuring
    charges of $104 million associated with this program.
    During the third quarter of fiscal 2010, as a result of changes
    in business requirements, Applied revised its global workforce
    reduction to approximately 1,000 positions and recorded a
    favorable adjustment of $20 million.

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Stock
    Repurchase Program

On March 8, 2010, Applied’s Board of Directors
    approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing up to
    $2.0 billion in repurchases over the next three years
    ending in March 2013. Under this authorization, Applied renewed
    its systematic stock repurchase program and may also make
    supplemental stock repurchases from time to time, depending on
    market conditions, stock price and other factors. In fiscal
    2010, Applied repurchased 28,802,000 shares of its common
    stock at an average price of $12.15 per share for a total cash
    outlay of $350 million. In fiscal 2009, Applied repurchased
    1,942,000 shares of its common stock at an average price of
    $11.80 per share for a total cash outlay of $23 million. In
    fiscal 2008, Applied repurchased 83,163,000 shares of its
    common stock at an average price of $18.04 per share for a total
    cash outlay of $1.5 billion.

Applied records treasury stock purchases under the cost method
    using the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method. Upon reissuance of treasury stock,
    amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to
    additional paid in capital. If Applied reissues treasury stock
    at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid in
    capital associated with prior treasury stock transactions is
    insufficient to cover the difference between the acquisition
    cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against
    retained earnings. During fiscal 2009, shares of treasury stock
    were issued in connection with Applied’s ESPP at an
    aggregate value that was less than the treasury stock’s
    acquisition price, resulting in $40 million being recorded
    against retained earnings.

Dividends

During fiscal 2010, Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.07 per share
    and one quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per
    share. The fourth quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share
    declared in fiscal 2010 will be paid on December 15, 2010
    to stockholders of record as of November 24, 2010. During
    fiscal 2009, Applied’s Board of Directors declared four
    quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each.
    During fiscal 2008, Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share
    each. Dividends declared during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008
    amounted to $361 million, $320 million and
    $323 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates
    that it will continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis
    in the future, although the declaration and amount of any future
    cash dividend are at the discretion of the Board of Directors
    and will depend on Applied’s financial condition, results
    of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and
    other factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends
    are in the best interest of Applied’s stockholders.

Share-Based
    Compensation

Applied has adopted stock plans that permit grants to employees
    of share-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock
    and restricted stock units (also referred to as
    “performance shares” under Applied’s principal
    equity compensation plan, the Employee Stock Incentive Plan). In
    addition, the Employee Stock Incentive Plan provides for the
    automatic grant of restricted stock units to non-employee
    directors and permits the grant of equity-based awards to
    consultants. Applied also has two Employee Stock Purchase Plans,
    one for United States employees and a second for international
    employees (collectively, ESPP), which enable eligible employees
    to purchase Applied common stock.

During fiscal 2010, 2009, and 2008, Applied recognized
    share-based compensation expense related to stock options, ESPP
    shares, restricted stock units and restricted stock. Total
    share-based compensation and related tax benefits were as
    follows:

The cost associated with equity awards that are subject solely
    to time-based vesting requirements, less expected forfeitures,
    is recognized over the awards’ service period for the
    entire award on a straight-line basis. The cost associated with
    performance-based equity awards is recognized for each tranche
    over the service period, based on an assessment of the
    achievement of performance goals.

At October 31, 2010, Applied had $180 million in total
    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to stock option, restricted stock unit and restricted
    stock grants, which will be recognized over a weighted average
    period of 2.4 years. Under the stock plans, there were
    155,617,000 shares available for grant at October 31,
    2010, 151,809,000 shares available for grant at
    October 25, 2009, and 167,289,000 shares available for
    grant at October 26, 2008.

Stock
    Options

Applied grants options to purchase shares of its common stock to
    employees and consultants, at future dates, at the fair market
    value on the date of grant. Most options are scheduled to vest
    over four years, and expire no later than seven years from the
    grant date. The exercise price of each stock option equals the
    fair market value of Applied common stock on the date of grant.
    Most options are scheduled to vest over four years and expire no
    later than seven years from the grant date. The fair value of
    each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model was developed for
    use in estimating the value of publicly traded options that have
    no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
    Applied’s employee stock options have characteristics
    significantly different from those of publicly traded options.
    There were no stock options granted during fiscal 2010. The
    weighted average assumptions used in the model for fiscal 2009
    and 2008 are outlined in the following table:

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on a
    combination of historical and implied volatilities. When
    establishing the expected life assumption, Applied periodically
    reviews historical employee exercise behavior with respect to
    option grants.

The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted
    during fiscal 2009 and 2008 was $2.52 and $5.05, respectively.

Options outstanding had an aggregate intrinsic value of
    $73 million, $109 million and $1 million at
    October 31, 2010, October 25, 2009 and
    October 26, 2008, respectively. The total grant date fair
    value of options granted during fiscal 2009 and 2008 was
    $62 million and $34,000, respectively. The total intrinsic
    value of options exercised during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was
    $15 million, $1 million and $54 million,
    respectively. The total fair value of options that vested during
    fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $21 million,
    $14 million and $55 million, respectively. Cash
    received from stock option exercises was $78 million,
    $9 million and $328 million, respectively, during
    fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. The actual tax benefit realized for
    the tax deductions from options exercised for fiscal 2010, 2009
    and 2008 totaled $26 million, $22 million and
    $57 million, respectively.

Restricted
    Stock Units and Restricted Stock

Restricted stock units are converted into shares of Applied
    common stock upon vesting on a

one-for-one

basis. Restricted stock has the same rights as other issued and
    outstanding shares of Applied common stock except these shares
    have no right to dividends and are held in escrow until the
    award vests. Restricted stock units and awards of restricted
    stock typically vest over three to four years. Vesting of
    restricted stock units and restricted stock usually is subject
    to the grantee’s continued service with Applied and, in
    some cases, achievement of specified performance goals. The
    compensation expense related to these awards is determined using
    the fair market value of Applied common stock on the date of the
    grant, and the compensation expense is recognized over the
    vesting period. Beginning in fiscal 2007, Applied initiated a
    performance-based equity award program for named executive
    officers and other key employees. Awards of restricted stock
    units or restricted stock granted under this program vest only
    if specific performance goals set by the Human Resources and
    Compensation Committee of Applied’s Board of Directors (the
    Committee) are achieved and if the grantee remains employed by
    Applied through the applicable vesting date. The performance
    goals require the achievement of targeted relative annual
    operating profit margin levels as compared to Applied’s
    peer companies in at least one of the four fiscal years
    beginning with the fiscal year of the grant. The fair value of
    these performance-based awards is estimated using the fair
    market value of Applied common stock on the date of the grant
    and assumes that the specified performance goals will be
    achieved. If achieved, these awards vest over a specified
    remaining service period. If the performance goals are not met,
    no compensation expense is recognized and any previously
    recognized compensation expense is reversed. The



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

expected cost of each award is reflected over the service period
    and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. The Committee approved
    the grant of 1,825,000 performance-based restricted stock units
    and 50,000 performance-based shares of restricted stock under
    this program for fiscal 2010. There were no performance-based
    awards granted for fiscal 2009. The Committee approved the grant
    of 1,565,000 performance-based restricted stock units and
    100,000 performance-based shares of restricted stock under this
    program for fiscal 2008. With respect to the performance-based
    awards granted in fiscal 2010, as of October 31, 2010,
    40 percent of the performance goals associated with these
    awards had been achieved. The performance goals associated with
    the remaining 60 percent may still be achieved during the
    next three fiscal years. With respect to the performance-based
    awards granted in fiscal 2008, as of October 31, 2010,
    78 percent of the performance goals associated with these
    awards had been achieved. The performance goals associated with
    the remaining 22 percent may still be achieved during
    fiscal 2011.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase Applied
    common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to
    85 percent of the lower of the fair market value of Applied
    common stock at the beginning or end of each

6-month

purchase period, subject to certain limits. The number of shares
    issued under the ESPP during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was
    5,436,000 shares, 6,920,000 shares and
    4,617,000 shares, respectively. At October 31, 2010,
    there were 59,386,000 shares available for future issuance
    under the ESPP. Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
    the weighted average estimated fair value of purchase rights
    under the ESPP was $2.76 per share for the year ended
    October 31, 2010, $3.19 per share for the year ended
    October 25, 2009 and $4.97 per share for the year ended
    October 26, 2008. Compensation expense is calculated using
    the fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the
    Black-Scholes model. Underlying assumptions used in the model

Employee
    Benefits Plans

Employee
    Bonus Plans

Applied has various employee bonus plans. A discretionary bonus
    plan provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax
    profits to Applied employees who are not eligible for other
    performance-based incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of
    eligible compensation. Other plans provide for bonuses to
    Applied’s executives and other key contributors based on
    the achievement of profitability

and/or

other
    specified performance criteria. Charges under these plans were
    $320 million for fiscal 2010, no charges for fiscal 2009,
    and $150 million for fiscal 2008.

Employee
    Savings and Retirement Plan

Applied’s Employee Savings and Retirement Plan (401(k)
    Plan) is qualified under Sections 401(a) and (k) of
    the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees may make salary
    deferral and

catch-up

contributions under the 401(k) Plan on a pre-tax basis. Applied
    matches a percentage of each participant’s salary deferral
    contributions with cash contributions. Plan participants who
    were employed by Applied or any of its affiliates on or after
    January 1, 2010 became 100% vested in their Applied
    matching contribution account balances. Participants may direct
    that funds held in their 401(k) Plan accounts, including any
    Applied matching contributions, be invested in any of the
    diversified investment funds available under the 401(k) Plan or
    within certain limits in the Applied Materials, Inc. Common
    Stock Fund (Stock Fund), which invests solely in shares of
    Applied common stock. The Stock Fund is a non-leveraged employee
    stock ownership plan (within the meaning of
    Section 4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code) and, as a
    result, participants have the option of specifying that any
    future cash dividends paid on shares held in the Stock Fund be
    either reinvested in the Stock Fund or distributed directly to
    them in cash no later than 90 days after the calendar year
    for which the dividends were paid. Applied’s matching
    contributions under this plan were approximately
    $25 million, net of $1 million in forfeitures, for
    fiscal 2010; $24 million, net of $1 million in
    forfeitures, for fiscal 2009; and $29 million, net of
    $2 million in forfeitures, for fiscal 2008.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries and Other
    Post-Retirement Benefits

Several of Applied’s foreign subsidiaries have defined
    benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their
    eligible employees. Benefits under these plans are typically
    based on years of service and final average compensation levels.
    The plans are managed in accordance with applicable local
    statutes and practices. Applied deposits funds for certain of
    these plans with insurance companies, pension trustees,
    government-managed accounts,

and/or

accrues the expense for the unfunded portion of the benefit
    obligation on its Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Applied’s practice is to fund the various pension plans in
    amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements as
    established by applicable local governmental oversight and
    taxing authorities. Depending on the design of the plan, local
    custom and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may
    exceed qualified plan assets. The differences between the
    aggregate projected benefit obligations and aggregate plan
    assets of these plans have been recorded as liabilities by
    Applied and are included in employee benefits and accrued
    expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2009,
    Applied changed the measurement date for its defined and
    postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations from an
    interim date to Applied’s fiscal year end.

Applied also has a post-retirement plan that provides certain
    medical and vision benefits to eligible retirees who are at
    least age 55 and who have at least 10 years of service
    at their date of retirement. An eligible retiree also may elect
    coverage for an eligible spouse or domestic partner who is not
    eligible for Medicare. Coverage under the plan generally ends
    for both the retiree and spouse or domestic partner upon
    becoming eligible for Medicare. Applied’s liability under
    this post-retirement plan, which was included in other long-term
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was
    $12 million at October 31, 2010 and $11 million
    at October 25, 2009.

Applied’s investment strategy for its defined benefit plans
    is to invest plan assets in a prudent manner, maintaining
    well-diversified portfolios with the long-term objective of
    meeting the obligations of the plans as they come due. Asset
    allocation decisions are typically made by plan fiduciaries with
    input from Applied’s international pension oversight
    committee. Applied’s asset allocation strategy incorporates
    a sufficient equity exposure in order for the plans to benefit
    from the expected long-term outperformance of equities relative
    to the plans’ liabilities. Applied retains investment
    managers, where appropriate, to manage the assets of the plans.
    Performance of investment managers is monitored by plan
    fiduciaries with the assistance of local investment consultants.
    The investment managers make investment decisions within the
    guidelines set forth by plan fiduciaries. Risk management
    practices include diversification across asset classes and
    investment styles, and periodic rebalancing toward target asset
    allocation ranges. Investment managers may use derivative
    instruments for efficient portfolio management purposes. Plan
    assets do not include any of Applied’s own equity or debt
    securities.

Asset return assumptions are derived based on actuarial and
    statistical methodologies, from analysis of long-term historical
    data relevant to the country in which each plan is in effect and
    the investments applicable to the corresponding plan. The
    discount rate for each plan was derived by reference to
    appropriate benchmark yields on high quality corporate bonds,
    allowing for the approximate duration of both plan obligations
    and the relevant benchmark yields.

Future expected benefit payments for the pension plans and the
    post-retirement plan over the next ten fiscal years are:
    $10 million in fiscal 2011, $11 million in fiscal
    2012, $11 million in fiscal 2013, $16 million in
    fiscal 2014, $16 million in fiscal 2015, and
    $94 million collectively for fiscal years 2016 through
    2020. Company contributions to these plans for fiscal 2011 are
    expected to be approximately $18 million.

Executive
    Deferred Compensation Plans

Applied sponsors two unfunded deferred compensation plans, the
    Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (Predecessor EDCP) and the
    2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (2005 EDCP), under
    which certain employees may elect to defer a portion of their
    following year’s eligible earnings. The Predecessor EDCP
    was frozen as of December 31, 2004 such that no new
    deferrals could be made under the plan after that date and the
    plan would qualify for “grandfather” relief under
    Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Predecessor
    EDCP participant accounts continue to be maintained under the
    plan and credited with deemed interest. The 2005 EDCP was
    implemented by Applied effective as of January 1, 2005 and
    is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A
    of the Internal Revenue Code. Amounts payable, including accrued
    deemed interest, totaled $66 million at October 31,
    2010 and $77 million at October 25, 2009, which were
    included in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

APPLIED

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For fiscal 2010, U.S. income taxes have not been provided
    for approximately $652 million of cumulative undistributed
    earnings of several

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Applied intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in
    operations outside of the U.S. If these earnings were
    distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or
    otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries
    were sold or otherwise transferred, the Company would be subject
    to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment
    for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes.
    Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax
    liability related to these earnings is not practicable.

At October 31, 2010, Applied’s state net operating
    loss carryforwards were $55 million. The carryforwards
    expire between fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2031. Applied has a
    California research and development tax credit carryforward of
    $31 million which has an unlimited life. Applied also has
    net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions of
    $105 million. The carryforwards have lives ranging from
    five years to indefinite. Management believes it is more likely
    than not that all loss and tax credit carryforwards at
    October 31, 2010 will be utilized in future periods.

Applied’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax
    benefits associated with employee stock option transactions.
    These benefits, credited directly to stockholders’ equity,
    amounted to $2 million for fiscal 2010, $1 million for
    fiscal 2009, and $7 million for fiscal 2008 with a
    corresponding reduction to taxes payable of $2 million in
    fiscal 2010, $1 million in fiscal 2009, and $7 million
    for fiscal 2008.

Applied maintains liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These
    liabilities involve considerable judgment and estimation and are
    continuously monitored by management based on the best
    information available. A reconciliation of the beginning and
    ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax
    benefits is as follows (in thousands):

As of October 31, 2010, Applied had unrecognized tax
    benefits, net of federal deduction for state tax, of
    $324 million, all of which, if recognized, would result in
    a reduction of Applied’s effective tax rate.

As of October 31, 2010, the gross liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits was $328 million, exclusive of
    interest and penalties. Increases or decreases to interest and
    penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision
    for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
    Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were
    $6 million as of October 31, 2010 and $5 million
    as of October 25, 2009. All $6 million in interest and
    penalties is classified as a long-term liability in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Long term income taxes payable has
    been reduced by certain unrecognized tax benefits.

During fiscal 2010, Applied received a refund of
    U.S. federal taxes of approximately $130 million due
    to the carryback of the fiscal year 2009 net operating loss
    to fiscal year 2005.

During fiscal 2009, the Internal Revenue Service began an
    examination of Applied’s federal income tax returns for
    fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Applied believes it has adequately
    reserved for any income tax uncertainties that may arise as a
    result of this examination.

A number of Applied’s tax returns remain subject to
    examination by taxing authorities. These include
    U.S. federal returns for fiscal 2004 and later years,
    California returns for fiscal 2006 and later years, tax returns
    for

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

certain other states for fiscal 2005 and later years, and tax
    returns in certain jurisdictions outside of the United States
    for fiscal 2003 and later years.

The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations, as well
    as the amounts and timing of various tax payments that may be
    part of the settlement process, is highly uncertain. This could
    cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of
    current assets and non-current assets and liabilities. Applied
    does not expect a material change in unrecognized tax benefits
    in the next 12 months.

Applied products are generally sold with a

warranty period following installation. The provision for the
    estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is
    recognized. Parts and labor are covered under the terms of the
    warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based on
    historical experience by product, configuration and geographic
    region. Accordingly, current warranty provisions are related to
    the current year’s net sales, and warranty consumption is
    associated with current and prior year’s net sales.

Guarantees

During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 31, 2010, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee agreements was
    approximately $54 million. Applied has not recorded any
    liability in connection with these guarantee agreements below
    that required to appropriately account for the underlying

transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on
    historical experience and information currently available, that
    it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid
    under these guarantee agreements.

Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate
    subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft
    arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of
    credit. As of October 31, 2010, Applied Materials Inc. has
    provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately
    $181 million to cover these services.

Legal
    Matters

Semitool
    Shareholder Litigation

On November 17, 2009, Applied announced that it was making
    a tender offer to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
    Semitool in accordance with an Agreement and Plan of Merger
    entered into with Semitool. Following this announcement, three
    lawsuits were filed by Semitool shareholders in the District
    Court of the Eleventh Judicial District Court for the State of
    Montana, County of Flathead, against Semitool, Semitool’s
    directors, Applied Materials, Inc. and Applied’s
    acquisition subsidiary. The actions sought certification of a
    class of all holders of Semitool common stock, except the
    defendants and their affiliates. The complaints alleged that
    Semitool’s directors breached their fiduciary duties by,
    among other things, failing to maximize shareholder value and
    failing to disclose material information, and that Applied aided
    and abetted such alleged breaches. The actions sought injunctive
    relief, damages and attorneys’ fees.

On December 14, 2009, all parties in these cases reached an
    agreement in principle to settle the matters and the plaintiffs
    withdrew their motion to enjoin consummation of the transaction.
    Without admitting any wrongdoing or fault, Semitool disclosed
    certain additional information in its

Schedule 14D-9

filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on
    December 14, 2009. Following the tender of shares
    representing over 95 percent of the outstanding shares of
    Semitool common stock, the merger of Semitool into
    Applied’s acquisition subsidiary was completed on
    December 21, 2009. Pursuant to a memorandum of
    understanding between the parties, plaintiffs conducted
    discovery to confirm the fairness and reasonableness of the
    settlement and defendants agreed not to object to an application
    by plaintiffs’ counsel for an award of attorneys’ fees
    and expenses in an amount up to $200,000. A class of
    Semitool’s public shareholders is expected to be certified
    solely for purposes of settlement, which, if approved by the
    Court, will result in a complete and final discharge of all
    claims on behalf of the class.

Jusung

Applied has been engaged in several lawsuits and patent and
    administrative proceedings with Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd.

and/or

Jusung Pacific Co., Ltd. (Jusung) in Taiwan and South Korea
    since 2003, and more recently in China, involving technology
    used in manufacturing LCDs. Applied believes that it has
    meritorious claims and defenses against Jusung that it intends
    to pursue vigorously.

In 2004, Applied filed a complaint for patent infringement
    against Jusung in the Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan seeking
    damages and a permanent injunction for infringement of a patent
    related to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) equipment, and
    this case remains pending. Jusung unsuccessfully sought
    invalidation of Applied’s CVD patent in the Taiwanese
    Intellectual Property Office (TIPO). In September 2010, the
    Supreme Administrative Court dismissed Jusung’s appeal of
    the TIPO’s decision. In 2009, Jusung filed a second action
    with the TIPO seeking invalidation of Applied’s CVD patent,
    which remains pending.

In 2006, Applied filed an action in the TIPO challenging the
    validity of a Jusung patent related to severability of the
    transfer chamber on a CVD tool. Jusung sued Applied and AKT
    America in Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan alleging
    infringement of the same patent. In March 2009, the Hsinchu
    District Court dismissed Jusung’s lawsuit, and in October,
    2010, the Taiwan Intellectual Property Court dismissed
    Jusung’s appeal. Separately, the TIPO granted
    Applied’s request for invalidation and also revoked
    Jusung’s patent. . In January 2010, the Taiwan Intellectual
    Property Court granted Jusung’s appeal of the TIPO decision
    revoking its patent and remanded the



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

matter to the TIPO for reconsideration of validity. In November
    2009, Applied filed an action in China with the Patent
    Reexamination Board of the State Intellectual Property Office
    seeking to invalidate this patent. On June 18, 2010, the
    Patent Reexamination Board issued a decision invalidating
    Jusung’s patent in China. Jusung has appealed this decision.

In 2006, Jusung filed a complaint of private prosecution in the
    Taipei District Court of Taiwan alleging that Applied’s
    outside counsel received from the Court and used a copy of an
    expert report that Jusung had filed in the ongoing patent
    infringement lawsuits that Jusung had intended to remain
    confidential. The complaint names as defendants Applied’s
    outside counsel in Taiwan, as well as Michael R. Splinter,
    Applied’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer,
    as the statutory representative of Applied. The Taipei District
    Court dismissed the private prosecution complaint, and the
    matter was transferred to the Taipei District Attorney’s
    Office. The Taipei District Attorney’s Office issued four
    successive rulings not to prosecute, each of which Jusung
    appealed. In each instance, the Taiwan High Court District
    Attorney returned the matter to the Taipei District
    Attorney’s Office for further consideration. In October
    2010, the Taipei District Attorney’s Office issued its
    fifth ruling not to prosecute.

Korea
    Criminal Proceedings

In February 2010, the Seoul Prosecutor’s Office for the
    Eastern District of Korea (the Prosecutor’s Office)
    indicted employees of several companies for the alleged improper
    receipt and use of confidential information belonging to Samsung
    Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), a major Applied customer based
    in Korea. The Prosecutor’s Office did not name Applied or
    any of its subsidiaries as a party to the criminal action. The
    individuals charged included the former head of Applied
    Materials Korea (AMK), who at the time of the indictment was a
    vice president of Applied Materials, Inc., and certain other AMK
    employees. Hearings on these matters are ongoing in the Seoul
    Eastern District Court. Applied and Samsung entered into a
    settlement agreement effective as of November 1, 2010,
    which resolves potential civil claims related to this matter and
    which is separate from and does not affect the criminal
    proceedings.

From time to time, Applied receives notification from third
    parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking
    indemnification, litigation support, payment of money or other
    actions by Applied in connection with claims made against them.
    In addition, from time to time, Applied receives notification
    from third parties claiming that Applied may be or is infringing
    or misusing their intellectual property or other rights. Applied
    also is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims,
    both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course
    of business.

Although the outcome of the above-described matters or these
    claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
    Applied does not believe that any of these proceedings or other
    claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial condition or results of operations.

Note 17

Industry
    Segment Operations

Applied’s four reportable segments are: Silicon Systems
    Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and
    Environmental Solutions. Applied’s chief operating
    decision-maker has been identified as the President and Chief
    Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make
    decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance
    for the entire Company. Segment information is presented based
    upon Applied’s management organization structure as of
    October 31, 2010 and the distinctive nature of each
    segment. Future changes to this internal financial structure may
    result in changes to the Company’s reportable segments.

Each reportable segment is separately managed and has separate
    financial results that are reviewed by Applied’s chief
    operating decision-maker. Each reportable segment contains
    closely related products that are unique to the particular
    segment. Segment operating income is determined based upon
    internal performance measures used by Applied’s chief
    operating decision-maker.

Applied derives the segment results directly from its internal
    management reporting system. The accounting policies Applied
    uses to derive reportable segment results are substantially the
    same as those used for external

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

reporting purposes. Effective in the first quarter of fiscal
    2010, Applied changed its methodology for allocating certain
    expenses to its reportable segments, such as components of
    variable compensation and operating expenses associated with the
    global sales organization. Applied has reclassified segment
    operating results for fiscal 2009 and 2008 to conform to the
    fiscal 2010 presentation. Management measures the performance of
    each reportable segment based upon several metrics including
    orders, net sales and operating income. Management uses these
    results to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources
    to, each of the reportable segments. Applied does not allocate
    to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it
    manages separately at the corporate level, which include costs
    related to share-based compensation; certain management,
    finance, legal, human resources, and research, development and
    engineering functions provided at the corporate level; and
    unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. In addition,
    Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments
    restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated
    adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these
    charges or adjustments pertain to a specific reportable segment.
    Segment operating income excludes interest income/expense and
    other financial charges and income taxes according to how a
    particular reportable segment’s management is measured.
    Management does not consider the unallocated costs in measuring
    the performance of the reportable segments.

The Silicon Systems Group segment includes semiconductor capital
    equipment for etch, rapid thermal processing, deposition,
    chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, and
    wafer packaging.

The Applied Global Services segment includes technically
    differentiated products and services to improve operating
    efficiency, reduce operating costs and lessen the environmental
    impact of semiconductor, display and solar customers’
    factories. Applied Global Services’ products consist of
    spares, services, certain earlier generation products, and
    remanufactured equipment. Customer demand for these products and
    services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with
    trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer
    sites.

The Display segment includes products for manufacturing LCDs for
    TVs, personal computers and other video-enabled devices.

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products
    for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules, high
    throughput

roll-to-roll

coating systems for flexible electronics and web products, and
    systems used in the manufacture of energy-efficient glass.

Note 18

Subsequent
    Event

On November 29, 2010, Applied entered into a Settlement
    Agreement (the Agreement) with Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.
    (Samsung). The Agreement resolved potential civil claims and
    removed the risk of civil litigation between the parties
    relating to the alleged acquisition, misappropriation and misuse
    of Samsung confidential semiconductor information in Korea that
    is the subject of criminal proceedings pending against employees
    of several companies, including current and former Applied
    Materials Korea employees, in the Seoul Eastern District Court
    of the Republic of Korea (the Korea proceedings). Neither
    Applied nor any of its subsidiaries is a defendant in the Korea
    proceedings. The settlement terms of the Agreement pertain to
    potential civil claims between the parties and are separate from
    and do not affect criminal proceedings against individual
    defendants, including but not limited to the individuals charged
    in the Korea proceedings.

Under the Agreement, which is generally effective for a
    three-year period starting November 1, 2010, Applied will
    provide volume-based rebates on purchases of semiconductor
    products by Samsung and its affiliated companies. Applied also
    will provide volume-based incentives related to Samsung’s
    use of Applied systems (i) for production of semiconductor
    devices in applications for which Samsung has not previously
    used Applied systems, and (ii) for joint development
    activities. In addition, the Agreement includes volume-based
    credits for certain upgrades, engineering services and spare
    parts. The financial impact of the above rebates and incentives
    on Applied’s consolidated results of operations and
    financial position will depend on the volume of purchases by
    Samsung after the effective date of the Agreement.

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    October 31, 2010 and October 25, 2009, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended October 31, 2010. In
    connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
    statements, we also have audited the financial statement
    schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    October 31, 2010 and October 25, 2009, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended October 31, 2010, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company adopted Accounting Standards
    Topic 805,

, during the year
    ended October 31, 2010.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Applied Materials, Inc.’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of October 31, 2010, based on criteria
    established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated December 10, 2010
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the
