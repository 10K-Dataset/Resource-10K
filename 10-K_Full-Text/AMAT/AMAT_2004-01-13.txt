PART I

Item 1:

Business

Organized in 1967, Applied, a Delaware
corporation, develops, manufactures, markets and services
integrated circuit fabrication equipment for the worldwide
semiconductor industry. Customers for these products include
semiconductor wafer manufacturers and semiconductor integrated
circuit (or chip) manufacturers, who either use the
semiconductors they manufacture in their own products or sell
them to other companies for use in advanced electronic
components.

Most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and
include a variety of circuit components, such as transistors and
other devices, that are connected by multiple layers of wiring
(interconnects). As the density of the circuit components is
increased to enable greater computing power in the same or
smaller area, the complexity of building the chip also
increases, necessitating the formation of smaller structures and
more intricate wiring schemes. To build a chip, the transistors,
capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the
surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to
deposit and remove selected film layers. Similar processes are
then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer.
A typical, simplified process sequence for building the wiring
portion of copper-based chips involves initially depositing a
dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit components
using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system. An etch system
is then used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric
layer. To form the metal wiring, these openings and patterns are
subsequently filled with conducting material using physical
vapor deposition (PVD) and/or electrochemical plating (ECP)
technologies. A chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) step then
polishes the wafer to maintain a flat surface. Additional
deposition, etch and CMP steps are then performed to build up
the layers of wiring needed to complete the interconnection of
the circuit elements to form the chip. Advanced chip designs
require about 500 steps involving these and other processes
to complete the manufacturing cycle.

Applied operates in a single industry segment for
the manufacture, marketing and servicing of integrated circuit
fabrication equipment. Applied currently manufactures systems
that perform most of the primary steps in the chip fabrication
process, including: atomic layer deposition (ALD), CVD, PVD,
ECP, etch, ion implantation, rapid thermal processing (RTP),
CMP, metrology and wafer inspection. Applied’s subsidiary,
AKT, Inc. (AKT), manufactures CVD systems and array testers for
making flat panel displays (FPDs) used in notebook computers,
desktop monitors, televisions and other applications.
Applied’s subsidiary, Etec Systems, Inc. (Etec), is a
manufacturer of systems that generate, etch, measure and inspect
circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process.
Applied also provides products and services to enhance
manufacturing yields.

Most of Applied’s products are single-wafer
systems with multiple process chambers attached to a base
platform. The simultaneous processing of several wafers enables
high manufacturing productivity and precise control of the
process. Applied sells most of its single-wafer, multi-chamber
systems on four basic mainframes: the Centura®, the
Endura®, the Producer® and the Vantage

TM

platforms. These platforms currently support ALD, CVD, PVD, etch
and RTP technologies.

Throughout its history, the semiconductor
industry has migrated to increasingly larger wafers to build its
chips. The predominant wafer size used for volume production
today is 200mm, or eight-inch, wafers, but



many fabs are now transitioning to 300mm, or
12-inch, wafers to gain the economic advantages of a larger
surface area. Applied offers a comprehensive line of systems for
processing both 200mm and 300mm wafers.

A majority of process steps used in chipmaking
are performed to build the interconnect, a complex matrix of
microscopic wires that carry electrical signals to connect the
transistor and capacitor components of a chip. Customers are
transitioning from using aluminum as the main conducting
material for the interconnect to copper, which has lower
resistance than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller
area. Applied is a leading supplier of systems for manufacturing
copper-based chips, ranging from the systems to deposit tantalum
nitride barrier and copper materials to CMP products, for
smoothing these layers for optimized planarity.

Complementing the transition to copper to improve
chip speed is the use of highly efficient low dielectric
constant (low k) films to replace silicon dioxide as
the insulator between the copper wiring structures. Applied
leads the industry in providing a low k dielectric process
that is being used in volume production by a number of
semiconductor manufacturers.

The transistor portion of the chip is another
area in which semiconductor manufacturers are advancing their
device designs to improve speed. Applied introduced several new
products this year for these new applications, particularly in
the areas of epitaxy, nitride and tungsten deposition to enable
these enhanced designs.

Products

The following summarizes Applied’s portfolio
of products and process technologies.

Deposition

Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a
semiconductor. During deposition, a layer of either dielectric
(material used as insulation between conductors) or electrically
conductive (typically metal materials used to carry current)
film is deposited or grown on a wafer. Applied currently
provides equipment to perform the four main types of deposition:
atomic layer deposition, chemical vapor deposition, physical
vapor deposition and electrochemical plating. Applied also
offers certain types of dielectric deposition processes using
its rapid thermal processing systems.

Atomic Layer Deposition

ALD is an emerging technology in which single
layers of atoms are used to build chip structures. This
technology enables customers to deposit a very thin layer of
either conducting or insulating material with uniform coverage
in very small areas. Applied offers ALD processes for depositing
tungsten and tantalum nitride films. The Applied Endura
iCuB/S

TM

product is the industry’s first system
to integrate ALD and PVD chambers on a single platform for
depositing the critical barrier and seed layers in copper
interconnects. The Applied Centura iSprint Tungsten system
combines an ALD chamber to deposit a tungsten nucleation film
with a CVD tungsten bulk fill process on one system. The iSprint
is used to form contact structures that connect the transistors
to the wiring areas of the chip.

Chemical Vapor Deposition

CVD is used by customers to deposit dielectric
and metal films on a wafer. During the CVD process, gases that
contain atoms of the material to be deposited react on the wafer
surface, forming a thin film of solid material. Films deposited
by CVD may be silicon oxide, single-crystal epitaxial silicon,
silicon nitride, dielectric anti-reflective coatings, low k
dielectric (highly efficient insulating materials), high k
dielectric (electrical charge-storing materials), aluminum,
titanium, titanium nitride, polysilicon, tungsten, refractory
metals or silicides. Applied offers the following CVD products
and technologies:

The Applied Producer CVD
system

— This
high-throughput platform features Twin-Chamber

TM

modules that have two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up
to three Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer
platform, giving it a maximum simultaneous processing capacity
of six wafers. Many of Applied’s dielectric CVD processes
can be performed on this platform. The Applied Producer Advanced
Patterning Film

TM

process is an innovative CVD
hardmask film that enables customers to fabricate sub-50
nanometer (nm) transistor gates and contact structures using
standard lithography. In fiscal 2003, the Company introduced the
Applied Producer DARC 193 process, a dielectric anti-reflective
coating that provides the precise dimensional control and
compatibility needed for fabricating interconnects and
transistors using advanced lithography methods.

The Applied Centura Ultima
HDP-CVD

®

system

— High-density plasma CVD (HDP-CVD) is used to fill
very small, deep spaces with dielectric film. One of the
processes offered on the system is fluorinated



silicate glass (FSG), a film with higher
insulating value than traditionally-used silicon dioxide
material that enables faster chip performance. The Applied
Centura Ultima HDP-CVD product is used by a number of major
semiconductor manufacturers for gap-fill applications, including
the deposition of FSG in their advanced interconnect structures
and deposition of silicon oxides in substrate isolation
structures.

Low k Dielectric
Films

— Many semiconductor
manufacturers are now incorporating new low k dielectric
materials in their new copper-based chip designs to improve
interconnect speed. The Applied Producer Black
Diamond

TM

CVD low k process is being used by
customers in volume production to produce some of the
industry’s most advanced devices. Using conventional CVD
equipment, the Black Diamond process has provided customers with
a cost-effective way to transition to this new and challenging
material. A complementary low k dielectric film, called the
Applied Producer BLOk

TM

(Barrier
Low k) enables the complete, multi-layer dielectric
structure to benefit from low k technology.

Epitaxial Deposition

— Epitaxial silicon (epitaxy or epi) is a layer of
pure silicon grown in a uniform crystalline structure on the
wafer to form a high quality base for the device circuitry. Epi
technology is used in an increasing number of semiconductor
devices in both the wafer substrate and transistor areas of a
chip to enhance speed. The Applied Centura Epi system integrates
pre- and post-epi processes on the same system to improve film
quality and reduce production costs. Launched in fiscal 2003,
the Applied Centura RP Epi system offers selective epi processes
for transistor-level applications. In addition to silicon
applications, the Company offers the Applied Centura Epi system
for silicon-germanium epi process technology, which can reduce
power usage and increase speed in certain types of advanced
chips.

Polysilicon
Deposition

— Polysilicon is
a type of silicon used to form portions of the transistor
structure within the semiconductor device. The Applied Centura
Polygen

TM

LPCVD (low pressure chemical vapor
deposition) system is a single-wafer, multi-chamber product that
deposits thin polysilicon films at high temperatures with high
productivity and process control. A variant of the system, the
Applied Centura Polycide LPCVD product, combines chambers for
polysilicon and tungsten silicide deposition on the Centura
platform in an integrated process to create transistor gate
structures in memory chips. To address the challenging
requirements of 130nm and below devices, the Applied Centura DPN
(decoupled plasma nitridation) system integrates chambers for
DPN and RTP anneal on one platform to enable superior film
quality, material properties and process control.

Silicon Nitride
Deposition

— The Applied
Centura SiNgen

TM

LPCVD system is a single-wafer,
high-temperature system that deposits silicon nitride films in
transistor-area applications. This system minimizes the amount
of time the wafer is exposed to high temperatures and reduces
particles while improving operating cost and productivity in
critical transistor nitride layers for 130nm and below devices.
The system also features the DPN chamber which uses a plasma
process to incorporate a high concentration of nitrogen into the
gate oxide to prevent leakage in devices with 90nm and below
designs.

Tungsten Deposition

— Tungsten material is used in the “contact”
area of a chip that connects the transistors to the wiring
circuitry. In aluminum-based devices, tungsten is also used in
the structures that connect the multiple layers of aluminum
wiring. The Company has two products for depositing tungsten:
the Applied Centura Sprint

TM

Tungsten CVD system for
130nm and 90nm devices and the advanced Applied Centura iSprint
ALD/CVD system. The latter product combines ALD technology and
CVD chambers on the same platform for 65nm and below
applications.

Physical Vapor Deposition

PVD, also called sputtering, is a physical
process in which atoms of a gas, such as argon, are accelerated
at a metal target. The metal atoms chip off, or sputter away,
and are then deposited on the wafer. The Applied Endura PVD
system offers a broad range of advanced deposition processes,
including aluminum, aluminum alloys, cobalt, titanium/ titanium
nitride, tantalum/ tantalum nitride, tungsten/ tungsten nitride,
nickel vanadium and copper (Cu). The Applied Endura CuB/S
(copper barrier/seed) PVD system, launched in fiscal 1998, is
widely used by customers for fabricating copper-based chips.
Using PVD technology, the system deposits the critical layers
that prevent copper material from entering other areas of the
device and primes the structure for the subsequent deposition of
bulk copper material by electrochemical plating.

The Endura’s highly flexible, multi-chamber
architecture allows the integration of multiple PVD processes or
combinations of metal CVD and PVD technologies on the same
system. In addition to the integrated Applied Endura iCuB/S
ALD/PVD system (discussed in the Atomic Layer Deposition
section), the Applied Endura iLB PVD/CVD system combines a PVD
chamber for depositing titanium with a CVD chamber for titanium
nitride deposition to form the critical lining layers of
interconnect structures. These structures are subsequently
filled with tungsten, aluminum, copper or other materials.



Electrochemical Plating

Electrochemical plating is a process by which
metal atoms from a chemical fluid (an electrolyte) are deposited
on the surface of an immersed object. Its main application in
the semiconductor industry is to deposit copper in interconnect
wiring structures. This process step follows the deposition of
barrier and seed layers which prevent the copper from
contaminating other areas of the device and improve the adhesion
of the copper film.

The Applied SlimCell ECP (electrochemical
plating) system introduced in fiscal 2003, offers a new
small-volume cell design that allows independent bath chemistry
for multi-step processing. The system enables a reduction in
defect levels compared to conventional large bath systems while
reducing chemical consumption.

Etch

Etching is used many times throughout the
semiconductor manufacturing process to selectively remove
material from the surface of a wafer. Before etching begins, the
wafer is coated with a light-sensitive film, called photoresist.
A photolithography process then projects the circuit pattern
onto the wafer. Etching removes material only from areas
dictated by the photoresist pattern. Applied offers a full range
of systems for etching dielectric, metal and silicon films to
meet the requirements of sub-100nm processing.

For dielectric applications, the Applied Centura
eMax

TM

system etches a broad range of films in the
contact and interconnect regions of the chip. The recently
introduced high-throughput Applied Producer Etch system targets
cost-driven etch applications with 90nm and below design
geometries. To address advanced low k etch applications,
the Company introduced its Applied Centura Enabler

TM

Etch system in fiscal 2003 that performs etch, strip and clean
steps in a single chamber. The Enabler’s all-in-one
capability streamlines the process flow for 65nm and below chip
designs and significantly reduces operating costs.

The Applied Centura DPS Etch systems are used to
etch conducting films, such as metal and silicon materials, and
offer customers the technology, productivity and reliability
required for 100nm and below processing. The Applied Centura
Transforma

TM

Etch patterning system combines silicon
etch technology with integrated metrology capability to enable
customers to improve process control, device yield and overall
fab cycle time for building advanced transistor gate structures.

Ion Implantation

During ion implantation, silicon wafers are
bombarded by a beam of ions, called dopants, that penetrate (or
implant) the film surface to a desired depth. The implantation
step is used during transistor fabrication to change the
properties of a material and achieve a particular electrical
performance.

Low-energy, high current implant technology is
key to enabling the fabrication of smaller structures, which
contributes to faster transistor performance. The Applied
Quantum

TM

II system provides customers with the
capability to create thin, advanced transistor structures for
sub-100nm applications.

Rapid Thermal Processing

RTP subjects a wafer to rapid bursts of intense
heat that can take the wafer from room temperature to more than
1,000 degrees Celsius in less than 10 seconds. RTP is used
mainly for modifying the properties of deposited films. The
Applied Centura XE+ and Radiance® RTP systems offer
advances in temperature and ramp rate control as well as other
features aimed at providing leading-edge capability for
sub-130nm generations. These single-wafer systems are also used
for growing high quality oxide and oxynitride films, deposition
steps that traditional batch furnaces can no longer achieve with
the necessary precision and control. The Company also offers the
Applied Vantage Radiance RTP system, a streamlined platform
designed for high-volume 300mm manufacturing.

Chemical Mechanical Polishing

CMP removes material from a wafer to create a
flat (planarized) surface. This allows subsequent
photolithography patterning steps to take place with greater
accuracy and enables film layers to build up with minimal height
variations. Applied entered the CMP market in 1995 with its
Mirra® system and has since added several important
features to this product, including integrated cleaning, film
measurement and process control capabilities. In fiscal 2003,
Applied introduced a new system on its 300mm Applied
Reflexion® CMP platform, the Applied Reflexion LK system,
for polishing the delicate copper/low k interconnects using
low downforce, high-throughput technology. The Reflexion LK is
the only CMP system in the industry to



integrate single-wafer full immersion vapor
drying capability for eliminating defects and improving device
yields during the cleaning process.

Metrology and Wafer
    Inspection

Applied offers several types of products that are
used to inspect the wafer during various stages of the
fabrication process in the following categories:

Critical Dimension and Defect Review Scanning
    Electron Microscopes (CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)

Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an
electron beam to form images of microscopic features of a
semiconductor wafer at extremely high magnification. Applied
provides customers with full automation, along with the high
accuracy and sensitivity needed for measuring
advanced-generation feature sizes. The Applied
NanoSEM

TM

3D Metrology system extends CD-SEM
technology beyond the measurement of critical dimensions to
enable the three-dimensional imaging of chip structures to more
precisely control the lithography and etching processes.

DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (such as,
particles, scratches or residues) that are first located by a
defect detection system and then classify the defects to
identify their source. The high-throughput, fully automatic
Applied SEMVision

TM

G2 Defect Analysis system enables
customers to use this technology as an integral part of their
production lines to analyze defects as small as 50nm with high
productivity.

In fiscal 2003, Applied acquired Boxer Cross,
Inc. and added the Applied BX-10 Implant/ Anneal Metrology
system to its product line. The BX-10 system measures critical
process parameters that directly affect transistor performance
and provides users with monitoring capability for multiple
future device generations.

Wafer Inspection

Using laser-based technology, defects can be
detected on patterned wafers (wafers with circuit images printed
on them) as they move between processing steps. Defects may
include particles, open circuit lines, shorts between lines or
other problems. The Applied ComPlus-EV Inspection system,
introduced in fiscal 2003, detects defects in devices with
design rules of 90nm and below. Incorporating key advances in
imaging technology, the system captures up to 50 percent
more defects than the previous system with the high speed
required for customers’ volume production lines.

Flat Panel Displays

The most advanced flat panel displays (FPDs) are
manufactured using technologies similar to those for making
semiconductors. One difference is the vastly larger area of the
substrate (panel). Compared to today’s largest wafers
(300mm diameter), the panels can be up to 35 times larger in
area. New generation FPD fabs are being built primarily for
manufacturing large-area flat panel liquid crystal display (LCD)
television screens, which is experiencing strong demand and is
projected to continue growing at significant rates as consumers
move to larger home entertainment systems.

Applied supplies plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD)
systems and electron beam array testers to FPD manufacturers.
Applied offers a range of systems that can process different
substrate sizes to meet the industry’s requirements for
ever larger substrates. In response to the growing market for
larger LCD screens, Applied introduced its latest PECVD system
in fiscal 2003, the sixth-generation AKT-25K PECVD, which
addresses FPD fab requirements for substrates larger than one
square meter.

Mask Making

Masks are used by photolithography systems to
transfer microscopic circuit designs onto wafers. Since any
imperfection will be replicated on the wafer, the mask must be
defect-free with precise imaging. Applied provides systems for
the writing, etching, measurement and inspection of masks.

Customer Service and Support

Applied Global Services plays a critical role in
the Company’s ability to continuously satisfy its
customers’ production requirements. Approximately 3,000
trained customer engineers and process support engineers are
deployed in more than a dozen countries. These engineers are
usually located at or near the customers’ fab sites and
service over 16,000 installed Applied systems.

Applied’s line of service products offers an
innovative approach to maintaining and servicing Applied
equipment in customers’ fabs. With the Applied Total Parts
Management® (TPM) program, the Company



provides an inventory management service for the
spare parts used in Applied’s systems at a customer’s
fab. A second product, called the Applied Total Support
Package® (TSP), is a comprehensive equipment service
solution that includes parts management along with system cost
and performance improvement targets for Applied’s equipment
at the customer’s location. The Applied
SparesSolutions

TM

program is an on-line customer
support service that streamlines the procurement of spare parts.
The Applied Total Kit Management

TM

program provides
customers with a convenient, cost-effective way to manage their
systems’ process kit service requirements. Applied also
refurbishes and sells previously used Applied equipment.

Backlog

Applied’s backlog decreased from
$3.2 billion at October 27, 2002 to $2.5 billion
at October 26, 2003. Applied manufactures its systems based
on order backlog and customer commitments. Backlog includes only
orders for which written authorizations have been accepted,
shipment dates within 12 months have been assigned and
revenue has not been recognized. In addition, backlog includes
service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the
next 12 months. However, customers may delay delivery of
products or cancel orders suddenly prior to shipment, subject to
possible cancellation penalties. Backlog adjustments for fiscal
2003 totaled $553 million, which consisted of
cancellations, currency and other adjustments. Due to possible
customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of
orders, Applied’s backlog at any particular date is not
necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding
period. Delays in delivery schedules and/or a reduction of
backlog during any particular period could have a material
adverse effect on Applied’s business and results of
operations.

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and
Supplies

Applied’s manufacturing activities consist
primarily of assembling various commercial and proprietary
components into finished systems in Austin, Texas. Applied also
has manufacturing operations in Santa Clara, California;
Hillsboro, Oregon; Horsham, England; and Rehovot, Israel.
Production requires some raw materials, including a wide variety
of mechanical and electrical components, to be manufactured to
Applied’s specifications. Applied uses numerous vendors to
supply parts, components and subassemblies (parts) for the
manufacture and support of its products. Although Applied makes
reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from
multiple qualified suppliers, this is not always possible;
accordingly, some key parts may be obtained only from a single
supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Applied has sought,
and will continue to seek, to minimize the risk of production
and service interruptions and/or shortages of key parts by:
1) selecting and qualifying alternative suppliers for key
parts; 2) monitoring the financial condition of key
suppliers; 3) maintaining appropriate inventories of key
parts; and 4) qualifying parts on a timely basis.

Research, Development and
Engineering

Applied’s long-term growth strategy requires
continued development of new manufacturing products.
Applied’s significant investment in research, development
and engineering (RD&E) has generally enabled it to deliver
new products and technologies before the emergence of strong
demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products
into their manufacturing plans at an early stage in the
technology selection cycle. Applied works closely with its
global customers to design systems and processes that meet their
planned technical and production requirements. Product
development and engineering organizations are primarily located
in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom and
Israel, with process support and customer demonstration
laboratories in the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel.

Applied invested $1.2 billion
(16 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2001,
$1.1 billion (21 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2002
and $921 million (21 percent of net sales) for fiscal
2003, in RD&E for product development and engineering
programs to create new product lines and improve existing
technologies. Applied has spent an average of 16 percent of
net sales on RD&E over the last five years. In addition to
RD&E for specific product technologies, Applied maintains
ongoing programs in software, automation control systems,
materials research and environmental control that have
applications to its products. In fiscal 2003, Applied focused on
developing systems for customers’ new chip designs,
including systems to enable faster and denser transistor and
interconnect structures with 65nm and below linewidths.

Marketing and Sales

Because of the highly technical nature of its
products, Applied markets and sells its products worldwide
through a direct sales force. For fiscal 2003, net sales to
customers in each region as a percentage of Applied’s total
net sales were: North America (primarily the United States)
26 percent, Japan 18 percent, Europe



16 percent, Korea 15 percent, Taiwan
13 percent and Asia-Pacific (including China)
12 percent. Applied’s business is usually not seasonal
in nature, but it is cyclical based on the capital equipment
investment patterns of major semiconductor manufacturers. These
expenditure patterns are based on many factors, including
anticipated market demand for integrated circuits, the
development of new technologies and global and regional economic
conditions.

During fiscal 2003, more than 70 percent of
Applied’s net sales were to regions outside the United
States of America. Managing Applied’s global operations
presents challenges and involves uncertainties that may affect
Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
operations. For further discussion, see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Trends, Risks and
Uncertainties — Applied is Exposed to the Risks of
Operating a Global Business.”

Information on net sales to unaffiliated
customers and long-lived assets attributable to Applied’s
geographic regions is included in Note 10 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Net sales to Intel
Corporation represented 12 percent of Applied’s fiscal
2001 net sales, and 10 percent of Applied’s fiscal
2002 net sales. During fiscal 2003, two customers individually
accounted for greater than 10 percent of net sales: net
sales to Intel Corporation represented 13 percent of
Applied’s net sales, and net sales to Samsung America, Inc.
represented 12 percent of Applied’s net sales.

Competition

The global semiconductor equipment industry is
highly competitive and is characterized by increasingly rapid
technological advancements and demanding worldwide service
requirements. Applied’s ability to compete depends on its
ability to commercialize its technology and continually improve
its products, processes and services, as well as its ability to
develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer
requirements. Significant competitive factors for succeeding in
the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market include the
equipment’s technical capability, productivity and
cost-effectiveness, and level of technical service and support
provided by the vendor. The importance of each of these factors
varies depending on the specific customer’s needs and
criteria, including considerations such as the customer’s
process application, product requirements, timing of the
purchase and particular circumstances of the purchasing
decision. The pace of technological change is rapid, with
customers continually moving to smaller critical dimensions and
larger wafer sizes and adopting new materials for fabricating
the chip. Existing technology can be adapted to the new
requirements; however, these requirements sometimes create the
need for an entirely different technical approach. The rapid
pace of technological change continually creates opportunities
for existing competitors and startups, and can quickly diminish
the value of existing technologies.

Substantial competition exists for each of
Applied’s products. Competitors range from small companies
that compete with a single product and/or in a single region to
global companies with multiple lines of semiconductor processing
products. Competitors in a given technology tend to have
different degrees of market presence in the various regional
markets. Management believes that Applied is a strong competitor
and that its competitive position is based on the ability of its
products and services to continue to address customer
requirements. Success for Applied will require a continued high
level of investment in RD&E and in sales, marketing and
customer support activities.

Patents and Licenses

Management believes that Applied’s
competitive position is significantly dependent upon skills in
engineering, manufacturing and marketing, and not just on its
patent position. However, protection of Applied’s
technological assets by obtaining and enforcing patents is
important. Therefore, Applied has a practice to file patent
applications in the U.S. and other countries for inventions
that Applied considers significant. Applied has a number of
patents in the U.S. and other countries, and additional
applications are pending for new developments in its equipment
and processes. Applied does not consider its business materially
dependent upon any one patent, although taken as a whole, the
rights of Applied and the products made and sold under its
patents are a significant element of Applied’s business. In
addition to patents, Applied also possesses other proprietary
intellectual property, including trademarks, knowhow, trade
secrets and copyrights.

Applied enters into patent and technology
licensing agreements with other companies when management
determines that it is in its best interest to do so. Applied
pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the
use, in several of its products, of certain patented
technologies that are licensed to Applied for the life of the
patents. Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted
to third parties. Royalties received from and paid to third
parties have not been and are not expected to be material.



In the normal course of business, Applied
periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible
patent infringement. In dealing with such inquiries, it may
become necessary or useful for Applied to obtain or grant
licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance
that such licenses or rights will be available to Applied on
commercially reasonable terms. If Applied is not able to resolve
a claim, negotiate a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary
licenses on commercially reasonable terms and/or successfully
prosecute or defend its position, Applied’s business,
financial condition and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected.

Environmental Matters

Two of Applied’s locations have been
designated as environmental cleanup sites. In 1987, the United
States Environmental Protection Agency designated one of the
locations, in Santa Clara, California, as a Superfund site and
named Applied as a “Responsible Party.” Cleanup
activities at this site began in 1984 and were substantially
completed in February 2002. The California Regional Water
Quality Control Board has designated Applied as a
“Discharger” with respect to the other site in
Sunnyvale, California. Applied was named a Discharger at the
Sunnyvale site in 1997 as it currently owns the site in
question; however, prior owners and operators are responsible
for performing cleanup and monitoring activities. Applied
maintains a number of environmental, health and safety programs
that are primarily preventive in nature. Neither compliance with
federal, state and local provisions regulating discharge of
materials into the environment, nor remedial agreements or other
actions relating to the environment, has had, or is expected to
have, a material effect on Applied’s capital expenditures,
competitive position, financial condition or results of
operations. The most recent report on Applied’s
environmental, health and safety activities can be found on the
Company’s web site at

Employees

None of Applied’s employees are represented
by a trade union, and management considers its relations with
employees to be good. In the high-technology industry,
competition for highly-skilled employees is intense. Applied
believes that its future success is highly dependent upon its
continued ability to attract and retain qualified employees.
There can be no assurance that Applied will be able to attract,
hire, assimilate and retain a sufficient number of qualified
people. At October 26, 2003, Applied employed 12,050
regular employees.

Item 3:

Legal Proceedings

Novellus

On June 13, 1997, after Varian Associates,
Inc. (Varian) failed to respond to requests by Applied to
discuss certain patent issues, Applied filed a lawsuit against
Varian captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Varian
Associates, Inc. (case no. C-97-20523-RMW) in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
California, alleging infringement of several of Applied’s
patents concerning PVD technology. On July 7, 1997, Applied
amended that action to allege infringement of those same Applied
PVD patents against Novellus Systems, Inc. (Novellus) and to add
Novellus as a defendant, as a result of Novellus’
acquisition of Varian’s thin film systems PVD business. On
June 23, 1997, Novellus filed a separate lawsuit against
Applied captioned Novellus Systems, Inc. v. Applied
Materials, Inc. (case no. C-97-20551-EAI) in the
United States District Court for the Northern District of
California, alleging infringement by Applied of several PVD
technology patents that were formerly owned by Varian. Novellus
seeks damages for past infringement, a permanent injunction,
treble damages for willful infringement, pre-judgment interest
and attorneys’ fees. In September 2000, Applied and Varian
settled their disputes and Applied released all claims with
respect to the Inova system as it was made and sold as of
May 7, 1997. On October 3, 2000, Applied’s claims
against Varian and Varian’s claims and counterclaims
against Applied were dismissed with prejudice. The litigation
with Novellus continues. Discovery has closed in the actions.
The court has rescheduled the previously set trial date from
January 20, 2004 to May 24, 2004. Applied believes the
May trial will involve only infringement and validity issues
regarding Novellus’ patent claims against Applied and
Applied’s declaratory judgment claims against
Novellus’ patents. Applied believes it has meritorious
claims and defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

Axcelis Technologies

On January 8, 2001, Axcelis Technologies,
Inc. (Axcelis), formerly a subsidiary of Eaton Corporation,
filed a lawsuit against Applied in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts, captioned Axcelis
Technologies, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case
no. 01-10029 DPW). The lawsuit alleges that



Applied infringes a patent concerning ion
implantation owned by Axcelis. The complaint also alleges
various Massachusetts state and common law tortious interference
and unfair competition claims. Axcelis seeks a preliminary and
permanent injunction, damages, costs and attorneys’ fees.
On April 12, 2001, Applied answered the complaint by
denying all allegations and counterclaimed for declaratory
judgment of invalidity and non-infringement, and violations of
various unfair and deceptive trade practices laws. Applied seeks
damages, a permanent injunction, costs and attorneys’ fees.
On July 2, 2003, a jury ruled in favor of Applied,
returning a verdict that Applied’s Swift

TM

ion
implantation system does not infringe Axcelis’ patent. The
court has entered judgment in favor of Applied on Axcelis’
patent claim. Axcelis has filed a notice of appeal and the
appeal is proceeding. The state law claims have not yet been
resolved. Applied believes it has meritorious defenses and
counterclaims to the action and intends to pursue them
vigorously.

Linear Technology

On March 2, 2001, Linear Technology Corp.
(LTC) filed a third party complaint against Applied in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,
captioned Texas Instruments, Inc. v. Linear Technology Corp. v.
Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. 2-01-CV4 (DF)). The
complaint against Applied alleged that Applied is obligated to
indemnify LTC and defend LTC for certain claims in the
underlying patent infringement lawsuit brought by Texas
Instruments, Inc. (TI) against LTC. The complaint also alleged
claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, and various
unfair business practices. In the complaint, LTC alleged that,
before LTC purchased certain equipment from Applied, Applied
failed to disclose to LTC that TI previously had won a jury
verdict against Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd.
(Hyundai) for patent infringement based on Hyundai’s use of
certain semiconductor equipment including some Applied tools.
LTC’s Texas lawsuit against Applied sought indemnification
and damages from Applied and an order requiring Applied to
defend LTC in the underlying lawsuit with TI. On
January 15, 2002, the court granted TI’s motion to
sever Applied and the other third party defendants from the
action and dismissed LTC’s action against Applied and the
other third party defendants without prejudice. On
March 12, 2002, LTC filed a complaint against Applied in
the Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara, captioned
Linear Technology Corp. v. Applied Materials, Inc., Novellus
Systems, Inc. and Tokyo Electron Ltd.,
(case no. CV806004) alleging claims for breach of
contract, fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation,
suppression of fact, unfair competition, breach of warranty,
express contractual indemnity, implied equitable indemnity and
declaratory relief. On November 12, 2002, LTC filed an
amended complaint in the Santa Clara action asserting
essentially the same claims as in the original complaint but
adding an additional assertion that LTC and TI have settled
their litigation. In the amended complaint, LTC seeks
compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief and
restitution. LTC also seeks costs and attorneys’ fees
including costs and attorneys’ fees for the TI litigation.
Applied’s motion to dismiss the amended complaint was
granted in part. LTC filed a Second Amended Complaint and
Applied’s motion to dismiss the Second Amended Complaint
was also granted. LTC has filed a Third Amended Complaint
alleging claims for fraud and deceit by suppression of material
fact and violation of Cal. Bus. and Prof. Code 17200.
Applied has filed a motion to dismiss that complaint. Applied
believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to pursue
them vigorously.

Semitool

On June 11, 2001, Semitool, Inc. (Semitool)
filed a lawsuit against Applied in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California, captioned
Semitool, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc.
(case no. CV-01-2277 CRB). The lawsuit alleged
that Applied infringed a patent concerning seed repair and
electroplating owned by Semitool. Semitool sought a preliminary
and permanent injunction, damages, costs and attorneys’
fees. On July 12, 2001, before Applied had answered the
complaint, Semitool voluntarily dismissed its action against
Applied in the Northern District of California. On the same day,
Semitool filed a substantially identical action against Applied
in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon
captioned Semitool, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc.
(case no. CV’01-1066 AS). On July 13,
2001, Applied filed a declaratory judgment action against
Semitool in the Northern District of California captioned
Applied Materials, Inc. v. Semitool, Inc.
(case no. CV-01-2673 BZ). In that action, Applied
sought a declaration that Applied had not infringed the Semitool
patent and that Semitool’s patent is invalid and
unenforceable. Applied also sought costs and attorneys’
fees. The California Court has transferred Applied’s action
against Semitool to the District of Oregon. The actions are
proceeding together in Oregon. Semitool has also asserted
similar claims against certain other semiconductor equipment
manufacturers. The Oregon Court has issued an order interpreting
the patent claims and has scheduled a trial date of
February 3, 2004. Applied believes it has meritorious
claims and defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.



David Scharf

On July 31, 2001, David Scharf, an
individual, filed a lawsuit against Applied in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California, captioned
David Scharf v. Applied Materials, Inc.
(case no. 01-06580 AHM). The lawsuit alleges that
Applied has infringed, has induced others to infringe and has
contributed to others’ infringement of a patent concerning
color synthesizing scanning electron microscope technology.
Mr. Scharf seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction,
damages and costs. Applied has answered the complaint and
counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and
invalidity. On May 10, 2002, Mr. Scharf filed a
request for re-examination of his patent with the Patent and
Trademark Office. On June 26, 2002, the case was removed
from the Court’s active docket after the parties stipulated
to stay the case pending the results of that re-examination. On
July 11, 2002, Applied filed its own request for
re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with the Patent
and Trademark Office. Applied’s request for re-examination
was granted on September 19, 2002. Applied believes it has
meritorious defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue
them vigorously.

ASMI

On August 27, 2002, ASM America, Inc. and
ASM International, N.V. (collectively ASMI) filed a lawsuit
against Applied in the United States District Court for the
District of Arizona, captioned ASM America, Inc. and ASM
International, N.V. v. Applied Materials, Inc.
(case no. Civ’02 1660 PHX SMM).
The lawsuit sought a judicial declaration that ASMI does not
infringe six patents belonging to Applied that relate to remote
cleaning of CVD chambers and to deposition of silicon nitride.
The suit also sought a judicial declaration that two of the six
patents are invalid. Applied moved for a more definitive
statement with respect to two of ASMI’s causes of action.
On September 29, 2003, the court granted Applied’s
motion for a more definitive statement. ASMI filed an amended
complaint on October 31, 2003. The amended lawsuit seeks a
judicial declaration that ASMI does not infringe the six patents
and that the six patents are invalid. On December 15, 2003,
Applied answered the amended complaint by denying the
allegations and counterclaiming for infringement of the six
patents. Applied seeks damages, a preliminary and permanent
injunction, costs and attorney’s fees. No trial date has
been set. Applied believes it has meritorious defenses and
counterclaims and intends to pursue them vigorously.

On October 3, 2003, ASMI filed a lawsuit
against Applied in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas, captioned ASM America, Inc. and ASM
International, N.V. v. Applied Materials, Inc.
(case no. 2 03CV 348 TJW). The lawsuit
alleges infringement of six ASMI patents and seeks damages for
past infringement, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, and
injunctive relief. Applied responded to the complaint by denying
the allegations and counterclaiming for a declaratory judgment
of invalidity, unenforceability and non-infringement of the
patents. Applied also has asserted that ASMI is infringing seven
Applied patents, including the six patents at issue in the
Arizona action plus an additional patent. Applied seeks
injunctive relief, compensatory and enhanced damages, costs and
attorneys’ fees. Applied has filed a motion to transfer the
case from the Eastern District of Texas to the District of
Arizona. Applied believes it has meritorious defenses and
counterclaims and intends to pursue them vigorously.

Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates,
Inc.

On September 13, 2002, Varian Semiconductor
Equipment Associates, Inc. filed a demand for arbitration with
the American Arbitration Association asserting that Applied has
breached a patent license agreement between Varian and Applied
dated January 1, 1992. Varian seeks to recover royalties,
interest and attorneys’ fees. The arbitration hearing on
whether the products are covered by the license agreement has
concluded. On May 2, 2003, the arbitration panel issued an
interim decision finding that some, but not all, of the products
at issue were subject to the agreement. The arbitration panel
next will consider whether the asserted claims of the patents
under which those products were found to be covered are valid.
Applied believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to
pursue them vigorously.

Robert Bosch GmbH

On October 10, 2002, Robert Bosch GmbH
(Bosch), a German company, filed a lawsuit against Applied in
the United States District Court for the District of Delaware,
captioned Robert Bosch GmbH v. Applied Materials, Inc. (civil
action no. 02-1523). The lawsuit alleged that Applied
infringed two patents owned by Bosch related to anisotropic
etching. Bosch sought a preliminary and permanent injunction,
damages, costs and attorneys’ fees. Applied answered the
complaint and counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of non-



infringement and invalidity. The parties have
settled the litigation and on November 4, 2003, all claims
and counterclaims were dismissed with prejudice.

From time to time, Applied receives notification
from customers claiming that such customers are entitled to
indemnification or other obligations from Applied related to
infringement claims made against the customers by third parties.
In addition, Applied is subject to various other legal
proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that
arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome
of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does
not believe that any of these other existing legal matters will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or
results of operations.

Item 7:

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Results of Operations

Applied develops, manufactures, markets and
services integrated circuit fabrication equipment for the
worldwide semiconductor industry. Demand for Applied’s
products can change significantly from period to period as a
result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to,
changes in: 1) global economic conditions; 2) advanced
technology and/or capacity requirements of semiconductor
manufacturers; 3) the profitability of semiconductor
manufacturers; 4) supply and demand for semiconductors; and
5) relative competitiveness of Applied’s products and
services. For this and other reasons, Applied’s results of
operations for fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003 may not
necessarily be indicative of future operating results.

Effective the first fiscal quarter of 2001,
Applied implemented the SEC’s Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101, “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements.” For periods prior to fiscal 2001, data was not
available to provide pro forma information as if the change in
accounting principle were applied retroactively. For further
details, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Net Sales

Applied’s business was subject to cyclical
industry conditions in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003. As a result
of these conditions, there were significant fluctuations in
Applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales, both



within and across fiscal years. Demand for
semiconductor manufacturing equipment has historically been
volatile as a result of sudden changes in semiconductor supply
and demand and other factors, including rapid technological
advances in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication
processes.

Quarterly and full fiscal year financial
information follows:

(1)

Net income/(loss) included an after-tax expense
    of $267 million from a cumulative effect of change in
    accounting principle for the first fiscal quarter of 2001.



Net sales by geographic region, which were
attributed to the location of the customers’ facilities,
were as follows:

*

Primarily the United States.

**

Includes China.

During the first fiscal quarter of 2001, slowing
worldwide demand for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline
in demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Inventory
buildups in telecommunication products, slower than expected
personal computer sales and slower global economic growth caused
semiconductor companies to reduce their capital spending and
reschedule or cancel existing orders. This decline in demand
deepened sequentially throughout fiscal 2001 into a severe
industry downturn due to continued weakness in the
macro-economic climate and consumption of electronic goods,
which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by
Applied’s customers. Included in fiscal 2001 net sales were
$642 million of revenue recognized as part of the
cumulative effect of implementing the SEC’s Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), “Revenue
Recognition in Financial Statements.”

Net sales declined 31 percent from
$7.3 billion for fiscal 2001 to $5.1 billion for
fiscal 2002. The decline in demand for Applied’s products
continued into the first fiscal quarter of 2002. In the second
fiscal quarter of 2002, customers ordered equipment for 200mm
advanced capacity to satisfy demand driven by consumer-related
and wireless devices. Customers ordered 200mm capacity for this
demand increase as their transition to 300mm equipment was not
yet complete. Customers also continued to place technology
orders to invest in 300mm wafer processing, copper and smaller
line-width technologies. However, second quarter demand levels
proved to be unsustainable as the global economic environment
weakened through the middle of the year, and customers reduced
their level of capacity spending accordingly while maintaining
advanced technology spending. Net sales peaked in the third
fiscal quarter of 2002 and flattened in the fourth fiscal
quarter of 2002. Included in fiscal 2002 net sales was the
remaining $9 million of revenue that was recognized as part
of the cumulative effect of implementing SAB 101.

Net sales declined 12 percent from
$5.1 billion for fiscal 2002 to $4.5 billion for
fiscal 2003. Orders declined from $1.6 billion for the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2002 to $1.0 billion for the first
and second fiscal quarters of 2003, reflecting the continued and
prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry. However,
orders increased to $1.1 billion for the third fiscal
quarter and $1.3 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of
2003, reflecting customers’ continued investments in memory
and logic and their transition to 300mm, along with the
increased capacity utilization in both advanced and established
technologies. Following the new order trends, net sales
decreased to approximately $1.1 billion for each of the
first three fiscal quarters of 2003, reflecting the impact of
the prolonged industry downturns and increased to
$1.2 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003,
indicating the beginning of an industry recovery.

Realignment Activities

In response to the continuing difficult business
conditions, Applied implemented a series of activities to better
align Applied’s cost structure with prevailing economic
conditions during early fiscal 2003. Realignment activities
consisted of consolidation of facilities, reductions in
workforce, and refocused product efforts, such as the
electron-beam mask pattern product line and implementation of
the global spare parts distribution system (which included a
closure of a central warehouse). As a result of the realignment
activities, Applied vacated approximately two million square
feet and reduced approximately 3,800 positions. Realignment
activities resulted in charges across multiple categories, as
incurred, including cost of products sold, research, development
and engineering expenses, and restructuring and asset impairment
charges, as discussed below.



Gross Margin

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales
decreased from 44.3 percent for fiscal 2001 to
40.6 percent for fiscal 2002, and to 35.8 percent for
fiscal 2003. In fiscal 2000, Applied experienced unprecedented
new order and revenue growth. Accordingly, Applied expanded its
manufacturing facilities to accommodate anticipated growth. The
decreased business volume in fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, due to
the industry downturn, was insufficient to fully absorb the
overhead costs of these facilities, resulting in lower gross
margins for all respective periods. The continued decline in
gross margin for fiscal 2003 was principally attributable to
under absorption of manufacturing and field service costs as a
result of prolonged lower business volumes, and inventory
writeoffs and charges associated with refocused product efforts,
including an electron-beam mask pattern product and
implementation of the global spare parts distribution system.

Research, Development and
    Engineering

Applied’s future operating results depend,
to a considerable extent, on its ability to maintain a
competitive advantage in the products and services it provides.
Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make
substantial investments in research, development and engineering
(RD&E) to assure the availability of innovative technology
that meets the current and projected requirements of its
customers’ most advanced semiconductor designs. Applied has
historically maintained its commitment to investing in RD&E
in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. As
a result, RD&E expenses were $1.2 billion
(16 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2001,
$1.1 billion (21 percent of net sales) for fiscal
2002, and $921 million (21 percent of net sales) for
fiscal 2003. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months
depending on whether the product is an enhancement of existing
technology or a new product. Most of Applied’s existing
product lines are the result of internal product development
activities. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies
either in existing areas of development or through new product
opportunities to complement its existing technology capabilities
and to reduce time to market for market entry and penetration.
Throughout the periods covered by this report, Applied has
developed products designed to enable our customers to fabricate
chips with 65nm and below feature sizes and new materials such
as copper and low k dielectrics.

During fiscal 2001, Applied continued its
development of technologies for copper and low k-based
chips and 300mm wafers, as well as focused efforts on the core
technologies that would be required for customers to begin
development of 100nm and below generation devices. Areas of
increased investment included maskmaking technology, metrology
and inspection, ion implantation, and products for depositing
and etching new materials.

In fiscal 2002, Applied invested in critical
development activities to meet its customers’ rapid move to
sub-100nm dimensions in their most advanced designs, which were
anticipated to begin entering production in fiscal 2003. This
difficult and challenging dimensional shift was compounded by
the need to provide much of the technology for both 200mm and
300mm wafers, requiring additional process and hardware
development. For the sub-100nm chip generations, inspection and
metrology tools became more important to assure enhanced device
performance as well as adequate manufacturing yields.
Accordingly, Applied focused its RD&E resources on these
technologies. In addition, development of innovations such as
advanced wafer wet cleaning and atomic layer deposition, which
deposits materials in increasingly smaller structures, addressed
new market opportunities for Applied. Within virtually all of
the technology areas, including fab and yield management,
Applied invested in more advanced software capabilities.

In fiscal 2003, Applied refocused product efforts
and made investments in strategic products. Applied focused on
the development of several important processing technologies to
enable the production of new chips using copper and low k
dielectric materials, as well as to meet the challenges of
smaller, 65nm and below, feature sizes. In addition to
interconnect solutions, Applied continued to invest resources in
the development of systems for advanced transistor designs with
smaller gate structures that enable faster signal propagation
and reduced power. Applied also continued the development of its
process diagnostic and control capabilities with systems to
inspect and measure smaller dimensions and defects.

Marketing, Selling, General and
    Administrative

Marketing, selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased from $902 million (12 percent of
net sales) for fiscal 2001 to $709 million (14 percent
of net sales) for fiscal 2002, and to $626 million
(14 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2003. The decreases
from fiscal 2001 to 2002 and 2003 were due primarily to
headcount reductions and cost reduction activities, limiting
discretionary expenditures to align costs to a lower business
volume

.



Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other
    Charges

The restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2001,
2002 and 2003 were intended to better align Applied’s cost
structure with prevailing market conditions due to the prolonged
industry downturn. These actions, which were necessary as a
result of reduced business volume, reduced Applied’s global
workforce and consolidated global facilities.

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges for fiscal 2001 totaled $221 million, consisting of
a charge of $10 million for acquired in-process research
and development and restructuring and asset impairment charges
of $211 million. The restructuring and asset impairment
charges of $211 million consisted of $105 million for
headcount reductions, $45 million for consolidation of
facilities and $61 million for other costs, primarily fixed
asset writeoffs due to facility consolidation. As of
October 26, 2003, the majority of the fiscal 2001
restructuring actions have been completed.

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges for fiscal 2002 totaled $85 million, consisting of
a charge of $8 million for acquired in-process research and
development and restructuring and asset impairment charges of
$77 million. The restructuring and asset impairment charges
consisted of $39 million for headcount reductions,
$16 million for consolidation of facilities and
$22 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset
writeoffs due to facility consolidation. As of October 26,
2003, the majority of the fiscal 2002 restructuring actions have
been completed.

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges for fiscal 2003 totaled $372 million, consisting of
$186 million for headcount reductions, $86 million for
consolidation of facilities and $100 million for other
costs, primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility
consolidation. The fiscal 2003 restructuring activities are
expected to be completed during early 2004, which will result in
additional costs.

For further details, see Note 6 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income was $174 million for
fiscal 2001, $131 million for fiscal 2002 and
$102 million for fiscal 2003. The decrease in net interest
income in fiscal 2002 and 2003 was due primarily to lower
average interest rates.

Income Taxes

Applied’s effective income tax
provision/(benefit) rate was 29.8 percent for fiscal 2001,
21.0 percent for fiscal 2002 and (29.5) percent for fiscal
2003. The actual effective rate for fiscal 2001 of
29.8 percent differed from the anticipated effective rate
of 29.5 percent due to the non-tax deductible nature of
$10 million of acquired in-process research and development
expense and a shift in the geographic composition of
Applied’s pre-tax income. Applied’s actual effective
rate of 21.0 percent for fiscal 2002 differed from the
anticipated effective rate of 29.5 percent primarily due to
significant Foreign Sales Corporation and extraterritorial
income tax benefits, which resulted from an increase in Foreign
Sales Corporation and extraterritorial qualified income. Without
these additional benefits, earnings per share would have been
reduced by $0.02 for fiscal 2002

.

Applied expected and
experienced an actual effective benefit rate of
29.5 percent for fiscal 2003. Applied’s future
effective income tax rate depends on various factors, such as
tax legislation, the geographic composition of Applied’s
pre-tax income and non-tax deductible expenses incurred in
connection with acquisitions.

Business Combinations

On April 18, 2003, Applied acquired Boxer
Cross, Inc., a producer of in-line monitoring systems that
provide customers with critical electrical measurement data for
controlling semiconductor processes, for $14 million in
cash. On April 8, 2002, Applied acquired Electron Vision
Corporation, a designer, manufacturer and seller of e-beam
stabilization and curing tools for the semiconductor, thin film
head and micro-fabrication industries, for $26 million in
cash. On December 3, 2001, Applied acquired Global
Knowledge Services, Inc., a provider of advanced data mining
services to improve semiconductor manufacturing yield and
efficiency, for $16 million in cash. On November 20,
2001, Applied acquired the assets of Schlumberger’s
electron-beam wafer inspection business for $66 million in
cash. On June 27, 2001, Applied acquired Oramir, a supplier
of advanced laser cleaning technology for semiconductor wafer,
for $21 million in cash.

Consolidated Financial Statements.



Recent Accounting Pronouncement

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46
(FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51.”
FIN 46 provides guidance on: 1) the identification of
entities for which control is achieved through means other than
through voting rights, known as “variable interest
entities” (VIEs); and 2) which business enterprise is
the primary beneficiary and when it should consolidate a VIE.
This new requirement for consolidation applies to entities:
1) where the equity investors (if any) do not have a
controlling financial interest; or 2) whose equity
investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s
activities without receiving additional subordinated financial
support from other parties. In addition, FIN 46 requires that
both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with a
significant variable interest in a VIE make additional
disclosures. FIN 46 is effective for all new VIEs created or
acquired after January 31, 2003. For VIEs created or
acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of FIN
46 must be applied for the first interim or annual period ending
after December 15, 2003. Certain disclosures are effective
immediately. Applied holds an interest in a venture fund,
Applied Materials Ventures I, L.P. (Ventures I). Applied will
implement FIN 46 during the first fiscal quarter of 2004 and
will consolidate Ventures I as a VIE. Applied does not expect
the implementation to have a material effect on the financial
condition or results of operations. For additional discussion of
this recent accounting pronouncement and Ventures I, see
Note 1 and Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Applied increased its cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments from $4.9 billion at
October 27, 2002 to $5.5 billion at October 26,
2003. Applied has not undertaken any significant external
financing activities for several years.

Applied generated cash from operating activities
of $1.6 billion for fiscal 2001, $492 million for
fiscal 2002 and $802 million for fiscal 2003. The primary
sources of cash from operating activities have been net income,
as adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, and
changes in working capital levels, including accounts receivable
and inventories. Applied utilized programs to sell accounts
receivable of $1.2 billion for fiscal 2001,
$689 million for fiscal 2002 and $556 million for
fiscal 2003. These accounts receivable sales had the effect of
increasing cash and reducing accounts receivable and days sales
outstanding. Days sales outstanding was 68 days at the end
of fiscal 2003, compared to 66 days at the end of fiscal
2002 and 56 days at the end of fiscal 2001. A portion of
these sold accounts receivable is subject to certain limited
recourse provisions. However, Applied has not experienced any
losses under these programs. For further details regarding
accounts receivable sales, see Note 11 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements

.

Inventories were
reduced by $323 million in fiscal 2003 due to ongoing
inventory reduction and management programs.

Applied used $1.6 billion of cash for
investing activities for fiscal 2001, $693 million for
fiscal 2002 and $731 million for fiscal 2003. Capital
expenditures, net of retirements, were $711 million for
fiscal 2001, $417 million for fiscal 2002 and
$212 million for fiscal 2003, totaling $1.3 billion
for the past three years. Application laboratories, equipment
and related facilities comprised most of the capital spending.
The largest capital expenditure for the last three years was
$153 million for additional construction and fit-up of the
Maydan Process Module Technology Center in Sunnyvale, California
where Applied’s demonstration laboratories for new
technology applications are located. Fiscal 2002 capital
expenditures also included $65 million for the purchase of
properties in Santa Clara, California that were previously held
under a synthetic lease. Fiscal 2003 capital expenditures also
included $52 million for the purchase of facilities in
Hillsboro, Oregon that were previously held under a synthetic
lease. Investing activities also included purchases and sales of
short-term investments and acquisitions of technology or of
other companies to allow Applied to access new market
opportunities or emerging technologies.

Applied used $261 million of cash from
financing activities for fiscal 2001, and generated
$131 million for fiscal 2002 and $8 million for fiscal
2003. During fiscal 2001, net common stock activity used
$169 million of cash as stock repurchases increased and
stock sales to employees decreased. During fiscal 2002 and 2003,
net common stock activity generated $75 million and
$73 million of cash as proceeds received from stock sales
to employees exceeded the amount used for stock repurchases.
Since March 1996, Applied has systematically repurchased shares
of its common stock in the open market to partially fund its
stock-based employee benefit and incentive plans. Financing
activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt. Net
changes in debt used $92 million of cash for fiscal 2001,
generated $56 million of cash for fiscal 2002 and used
$64 million of cash for fiscal 2003.



On March 21, 2002, Applied’s Board of
Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of Applied’s
common stock, which was distributed in the form of a
100 percent stock dividend on or about April 16, 2002
to stockholders of record as of April 1, 2002.

Although cash requirements will fluctuate based
on the timing and extent of these factors, Applied’s
management believes that cash generated from operations,
together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances
and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy
Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next
12 months. For further details regarding Applied’s
operating, investing and financing activities for each of the
three years in the period ended October 26, 2003, see the
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, Applied
provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee
instruments to certain parties as required for certain
transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As
of October 26, 2003, the maximum potential amount of future
payments that Applied could be required to make under these
guarantee agreements was approximately $56 million. Applied
has not recorded any liability in connection with these
guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately
account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied
does not believe, based on historical experience and information
currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will
be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has additional guarantee
arrangements on behalf of certain subsidiaries. As of
October 26, 2003, Applied has not recorded any liability
related to guarantees of subsidiary obligations. Applied does
not expect, based on historical experience and information
currently available, that it is probable any amounts will be
required to be paid under these arrangements. Subsidiary
guarantees as of October 26, 2003 were associated with the
following types of arrangements: short-term borrowings, term
loans, overdrafts and leases. While certain subsidiaries have
short-term borrowing, term loans and overdraft facilities
available totaling approximately $169 million as of
October 26, 2003, no amounts were outstanding as
October 26, 2003. In the event of use and subsequent
default of these facilities by Applied’s subsidiaries, such
arrangements would be guaranteed by Applied. In addition,
certain subsidiaries have lease arrangements guaranteed by
Applied. These leases will expire between 2009 and 2014. In the
event that the subsidiaries do not make the required payments,
Applied could be required to pay the leases on behalf of the
subsidiaries. As of October 26, 2003, annual lease
obligations under these arrangements approximated
$12 million.

Ventures I invests in privately-held, early-stage
companies engaged in developing systems, components and devices
based on nanotechnology for specific applications and products.
Ventures I is a limited partnership with Applied as the sole
limited partner and an independent party as the general partner.
Applied has committed to fund $50 million in capital
contributions, but has reserved the option to discontinue
capital contributions at $25 million. Applied’s
capital contributions to Ventures I totaled approximately
$9 million through October 27, 2002 and
$16 million through October 26, 2003. See Note 3
of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further
details on Ventures I.

Applied also has operating leases for various
facilities. Total rental expense for operating leases was
$153 million for fiscal 2001, $140 million for fiscal
2002 and $134 million for fiscal 2003.

The following table summarizes the effect on
Applied’s liquidity and cash flows from contractual
obligations of debt arrangements and non-cancelable operating
leases as of October 26, 2003:

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of financial statements and
related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that
affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant
accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting
policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as
defined below.



A critical accounting policy is defined as one
that is both material to the presentation of Applied’s
financial statements and requires management to make difficult,
subjective or complex judgments that could have a material
effect on Applied’s financial condition and results of
operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the
following attributes: 1) Applied is required to make
assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time
of the estimate; and 2) different estimates Applied could
reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are
reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on
Applied’s financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and
their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the
circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur,
as additional information is obtained and as Applied’s
operating environment changes. These changes have historically
been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial
statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management
is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which
are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged
periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the
section below entitled “Trends, Risks and
Uncertainties.” Based on a critical assessment of its
accounting policies and the underlying judgments and
uncertainties affecting the application of those policies,
management believes that Applied’s consolidated financial
statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
and provide a meaningful presentation of Applied’s
financial condition and results of operations.

Management believes that the following are
critical accounting policies:

Warranty Costs

Applied provides for the estimated cost of
warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs
are determined by analyzing specific product and historical
configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs.
Applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product
failure rates, material usage, and labor costs incurred in
correcting product failures during the warranty period. As
Applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers
are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is
a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity
and availability of critical replacement parts is another
significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen
component failures or exceptional component performance can also
result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs
differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to
the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could
have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Inventories

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of
cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out
basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated
obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the
estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for
potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing
historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are
evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known
and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If
actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated,
additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete
inventory might be required, which could have a material adverse
effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Goodwill and Intangible
    Assets

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be
recoverable, and also reviews goodwill annually in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS)
No. 142 (SFAS 142), “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets.” Intangible assets, such as purchased technology,
are generally recorded in connection with a business
acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually
based on estimates and judgment regarding expectations for the
success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If
actual product acceptance differs significantly from the
estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment
charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. The fair
value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market
multiples approach, and is dependent on market values for
companies in a similar industry. A severe decline in market
value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for
impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on
Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.



Income Taxes

Applied accounts for income taxes in accordance
with SFAS No. 109, (SFAS 109) “Accounting for Income
Taxes,” which requires that deferred tax assets and
liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect
of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of
recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires that
deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is
more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset
will not be realized. Management has determined that it is more
likely than not that its future taxable income will be
sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets.

Applied provides for income taxes based upon an
annual estimated effective income tax rate. The effective tax
rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of
worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region,
non-tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with
acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management
carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the
effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results
differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record
a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its
effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse
effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Legal Matters

Applied is subject to various legal proceedings
and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the
ordinary course of business. Applied evaluates, among other
factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and
reasonably estimates the amount of the loss. Significant
judgment is required in both the determination of the
probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably
estimated. When Applied determines that it is probable that a
loss has been incurred, the effect is recorded promptly in the
consolidated financial statements. Although the outcome of these
claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not
believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a
material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations. However, significant changes in legal proceedings
and claims or the factors considered in the evaluation of those
matters could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Trends, Risks and Uncertainties

The industry that Applied serves is highly
    volatile and unpredictable.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor
industry, Applied is subject to the industry’s business
cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which are difficult
to predict. The semiconductor industry has historically been
cyclical because of sudden changes in demand for semiconductors
and manufacturing capacity, including capacity utilizing the
latest technology. The rate of changes in demand, including end
demand, is accelerating, and the effect of these changes on
Applied is occurring sooner, exacerbating the volatility of
these cycles. These changes have affected the timing and amounts
of customers’ capital equipment purchases and investments
in new technology, and continue to affect Applied’s net
sales, gross margin and results of operations. In addition to
affecting Applied’s customers and suppliers, these business
cycles also challenge key management, engineering and other
employees of Applied.

During periods of increasing demand for
semiconductor manufacturing equipment, Applied must have
sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer
demand, and must be able to attract, hire, assimilate and retain
a sufficient number of qualified individuals. The semiconductor
industry appears to be in the early stages of an upturn.
However, management cannot predict the sustainability of a
recovery, if any, and/or the industry’s rate of growth in
such a recovery, both of which will be affected by many factors,
including the global uncertainties discussed below. If Applied
is unable to effectively manage its resources and production
capacity during an industry upturn, there could be a material
adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results
of operations. Conversely, in downturns, Applied must be able to
appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market
conditions and effectively motivate and retain key employees. In
response to the downturn that began in fiscal 2001, Applied
continues the implementation of realignment activities in order
to align its cost structure with business conditions and to
enable Applied to focus resources on core research and
development programs. If Applied is unable to implement these
realignment activities according to the timetable and to the
extent anticipated, if implementation negatively affects
Applied’s operations, net sales or profitability, or if
Applied does not maintain effective cost controls,
Applied’s business, financial condition, or results of
operations may be negatively affected.



Applied operates in a highly competitive
    industry characterized by increasingly rapid

technological changes.

Because it operates in a highly competitive
environment, Applied’s future success is heavily dependent
upon effective development, commercialization and customer
acceptance of its new products and services over those of its
competitors. Specifically, these risks may include, but are not
limited to, Applied’s ability to timely and
cost-effectively: 1) develop new products, services and
technologies, including those utilizing new materials, such as
copper and low-k materials; 2) improve existing products,
services and technologies; 3) develop new markets in the
semiconductor industry for Applied’s products and services;
4) introduce new products and services to the marketplace;
5) achieve market acceptance and accurately forecast demand
for its products and services; 6) transition from 200mm
systems to 300mm systems; 7) qualify new or improved
products for volume manufacturing with its customers;
8) commence and adjust production to meet customer demands;
9) price products and services appropriately; and
10) lower customers’ cost of ownership. The
development, introduction and support of an increasingly broad
set of new or improved products, services and technologies,
including those enabling the transition to smaller device
feature sizes, new materials and 300mm wafers, grow increasingly
complex and expensive over time. Such new or improved products
and services may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies
compared to Applied’s more established products and
services and could adversely affect Applied’s gross
margins. If Applied does not develop and introduce new or
improved products, services and technologies in a timely and
cost-effective manner in response to changing market conditions
or customer requirements, its competitive position, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected.

Applied is exposed to risks as a result of
    ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
rapid ongoing changes, including: 1) more complex
technology requirements, 2) the changing information
technology cost structure and the importance of driving down
cost of ownership, 3) the increasing significance of
consumer electronics as a driver for chip demand and the related
focus on lower prices, 4) the growing type and variety of
integrated circuits and applications, 5) an increasing
number of applications across multiple substrate sizes in the
semiconductor industry, resulting in divergent interests among
semiconductor manufacturers, 6) a rising percentage of
business from customers in Asia and emergence of customers and
competitors in new geographical regions, 7) customer
demands for increasingly shorter lead times for the manufacture
and installation of semiconductor manufacturing equipment and
8) higher capital requirements for new semiconductor
fabrication plants. These factors are increasing the need for
customer partnering, use of foundries, collective research and
development efforts and process integration support. These
trends also heighten the importance of spare parts and services
as a competitive advantage for semiconductor equipment
manufacturers. In addition, key integrated circuit manufacturers
have become influential in technology decisions made by their
global partners. If Applied does not successfully manage the
risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the
semiconductor industry, its business, financial condition and
results of operation could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with
    a highly concentrated customer base.

Applied’s customer base is and has been
highly concentrated. Orders from a relatively limited number of
manufacturers of integrated circuits have accounted for, and
likely will continue to account for, a substantial portion of
Applied’s net sales, which may lead customers to demand
pricing and other terms less favorable to Applied. In addition,
sales to any single customer may vary significantly from quarter
to quarter. If current customers delay, cancel or do not place
orders, Applied may not be able to replace these orders with new
orders. As Applied’s products are configured to customer
specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may
result in significant and often non-recoverable costs. The
resulting fluctuations in the amount of and terms of orders
could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Applied is exposed to the risks of
    operating a global business.

During fiscal 2003, more than 70 percent of
Applied’s net sales were to regions outside the United
States. Certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers of
Applied are also located outside the United States. Managing
Applied’s global operations presents challenges, including
those arising from periodic regional economic downturns, trade
balance issues, varying business conditions and demands,
variations in enforcement of intellectual property and contract
rights in different jurisdictions, differences in the ability to
develop relationships with suppliers and other local businesses,
changes in U.S. and international laws and regulations
including U.S. export restrictions, fluctuations in
interest and currency exchange rates, the need to provide



sufficient levels of technical support in
different locations, cultural differences and shipping delays,
among other risks. Many of these challenges are present in
China, a large potential market for semiconductor equipment and
an area that Applied anticipates will present a significant
opportunity for growth. These challenges, as well as global
uncertainties with respect to: 1) economic growth rates in
various countries; 2) sustainability of demand for
electronics products; 3) capital spending by semiconductor
manufacturers; 4) price weakness for certain semiconductor
devices; and 5) political instability, terrorism, acts of
war, or epidemics in regions where Applied has operations or
sales, including Asia and Israel, may affect Applied’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

The ability to attract, retain, and
    motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s
    success.

Applied’s success depends in large part on
its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees,
including those in managerial, technical, marketing and support
roles. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to changes
in the global economy, the industry, Applied’s workforce
actions and realignment activities, and its changes in
management. If Applied does not successfully attract, retain and
motivate key employees, the Company’s operating results and
ability to capitalize on its opportunities may be materially and
adversely affected.

Manufacturing interruptions or delays could
    affect Applied’s ability to meet customer
    demand.

Applied’s business depends on its ability to
supply products that meet the rapidly changing demands of its
customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of
parts, components, and subassemblies (parts) from suppliers.
Some key parts may be obtained only from a single supplier or a
limited group of suppliers. In addition, Applied outsources
certain manufacturing activities. Significant interruptions of
manufacturing operations as a result of the failure or inability
of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts, outsourcing
difficulties, natural disasters (such as earthquakes or
tornadoes), or other causes (such as information technology or
infrastructure failures, regional economic downturns, political
instability, terrorism, acts of war, or epidemics) could result
in delayed product deliveries or manufacturing inefficiencies.
Any or all of these factors could materially and adversely
affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with
    acquisitions.

Applied has made, and may in the future make,
acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with
complementary products, services and/or technologies.
Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited
to: 1) diversion of management’s attention from other
operational matters; 2) the inability to realize expected
synergies resulting from the acquisition; 3) failure to
commercialize purchased technology; 4) impairment of
acquired intangible assets as a result of technological
advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired
company; 5) integration and retention of key employees; and
6) integration of operations. Mergers and acquisitions are
inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to
effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely
affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Applied is subject to risks of
    non-compliance with environmental and safety
    regulations.

Applied is subject to environmental and safety
regulations in connection with its business operations,
including but not limited to regulations related to the
development, manufacture and use of its products. Failure or
inability to comply with existing or future environmental and
safety regulations could result in significant remediation
liabilities, the imposition of fines and/or the suspension or
termination of development, manufacture or use of certain of its
products, each of which could have a material adverse effect on
Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Applied is exposed to various risks related
    to the regulatory environment.

Applied is subject to various risks related to:
1) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws,
rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies
and/or regulatory agencies in the regions in which Applied
operates and with which Applied must comply; and
2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional
regulatory agencies related to international trade.

For example, the World Trade Organization (WTO)
has determined that the U.S. Foreign Sales Corporation
(FSC) and Extraterritorial Income (ETI) exclusion constitute
prohibited export subsidies warranting the possible imposition
of trade sanctions on certain goods. Applied has benefited from
FSC and ETI tax provisions, and the elimination of these tax
benefits could materially and adversely affect Applied’s
financial condition and results of operations.



During fiscal 2002, Applied filed an application
with the SEC for an exemptive order confirming that it is not
subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the Act), which
requires companies primarily engaged in the business of
investing in securities to comply with additional rules and
regulations. Largely due to the industry downturn,
Applied’s ratios of investments to total assets and of
interest income to net income have increased, resulting in the
risk that Applied could be deemed to be covered by the Act. If
the SEC does not grant the exemption, Applied may have to take
other actions that could adversely affect its results of
operations in order not to be subject to the Act.

Applied is exposed to various risks related
    to legal proceedings or claims.

Applied from time to time is, and in the future
may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent
infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust,
environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product
performance, product liability, employment and other matters. In
addition, Applied on occasion receives notification from
customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or
other obligations related to infringement claims made against
the customers by third parties. These legal proceedings and
claims, whether with or without merit, are time-consuming and
expensive to prosecute or defend and divert management’s
attention and resources. There can be no assurance regarding the
outcome of current or future legal proceedings or claims. In
addition, Applied’s intellectual property rights may not
provide significant competitive advantages if they are
circumvented, invalidated or rendered obsolete by the rapid pace
of technological change. Furthermore, the laws of other
countries permit the protection of Applied’s proprietary
rights to varying extents, compared to U.S. laws.
Applied’s success is dependent in part upon the protection
of its intellectual property rights. Infringement of
Applied’s rights by a third party could result in
uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied.
If Applied is not able to resolve a claim, negotiate a
settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses on
commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or
defend its position, Applied’s business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected.

Item 7a:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    about Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

At October 26, 2003, Applied’s
investment portfolio included fixed-income securities with a
fair value of approximately $5.0 billion. These securities
are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if
interest rates increase. Due to the short duration of
Applied’s investment portfolio, an immediate
10 percent change in interest rates is not expected to have
a material effect on Applied’s near-term financial
condition or results of operations.

Applied’s long-term debt bears interest
primarily at fixed rates; therefore, Applied’s results of
operations would be affected by interest rate changes only to
the extent that variable rate short-term notes payable are
outstanding. Due to the short-term nature and relatively
insignificant amount of Applied’s short-term notes payable,
an immediate 10 percent change in interest rates is not
expected to have a material effect on Applied’s near-term
financial condition or results of operations.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in
foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, the euro, Israeli
shekel and British pound. Applied enters into forward exchange
and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not
all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated
transactions expected to occur within 12 months. Gains and
losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that the
related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the
effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward
exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the
related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these
financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to
risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency
exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign
currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on
Applied’s results of operations for fiscal 2001, 2002 or
2003.

Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the
same currency as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese
yen, the euro, Israeli shekel and British pound), and the terms
of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of
the underlying transactions. Applied’s outstanding forward
exchange contracts are marked-to-market (see Note 2 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as are the majority
of the related underlying transactions being hedged; therefore,
the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange
contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect
of these changes on the



underlying transactions. The effect of an
immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward
exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not
expected to be material to Applied’s near-term financial
condition or results of operations. Applied’s downside risk
with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the
premium paid for the right to exercise the option. Premiums paid
for options outstanding at October 26, 2003 were not
material.

Item 9a:

Control and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15(b), Applied
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the
period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of
Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. As
required by Rule 13a-15(d), Applied management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also
conducted an evaluation of Applied’s internal control over
financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred
during the fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Applied’s
internal control over financial reporting. Based on that
evaluation, there has been no such change during the fourth
fiscal quarter.

It should be noted that any system of controls,
however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system
will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events.

Note 1

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of
Presentation

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Applied Materials,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied or the Company) after
elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. All
references to fiscal year apply to Applied’s fiscal year
which ends on the last Sunday in October.

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ materially from those estimates.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
Investments

All highly-liquid
investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at
the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. All
of Applied’s short-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates.
Investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at
fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any material
temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an
investment is presented as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income. The specific identification method
is used to determine the realized gains and losses on
investments.

Inventories

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market,
with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

Property, plant and
equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the
estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line
method. Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes
are as follows: buildings and improvements, five to
33 years; demonstration and manufacturing equipment, three
to five years; software, three to five years; and furniture,
fixtures and other equipment, three to 15 years. Land
improvements are amortized over the shorter of 15 years or
the estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized
over the shorter of five years or the lease term. During fiscal
2003, Applied reviewed the estimated useful lives of its fixed
assets. This analysis indicated that estimated useful lives for
certain assets should be increased based on historical
experience and other considerations. This change in estimate
resulted in approximately $23 million less depreciation
expense in fiscal 2003 than would have been recognized under
previous estimates.

Intangible Assets

Applied adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 142 (SFAS 142), “Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets,” in the first fiscal quarter of 2002.
SFAS 142 supersedes Accounting Principles Board (APB)
Opinion No. 17, “Intangible Assets,” and
discontinues the amortization of goodwill. In accordance with
SFAS 142, beginning October 29, 2001, goodwill is no
longer amortized, but is reviewed annually during the fourth
fiscal quarter for impairment. Purchased technology and other
intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated
amortization, and are amortized over their estimated useful
lives of five to 10 years using the straight-line method.

Long-Lived Assets

Applied reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
these assets may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these
assets for impairment based on estimated future cash flows from
these assets.

Research, Development and Engineering
Costs

Research, development and
engineering costs are expensed as incurred.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs
were not material for all periods presented.

Revenue Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition
criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement
exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

seller’s price to buyer is fixed or
determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. At
Applied, this policy generally results in revenue recognition at
the following points: 1) for all transactions where legal
title passes to the customer upon shipment, Applied recognizes
revenue upon shipment for all products that have been
demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment.
However, a portion of revenue associated with certain
installation-related tasks, is recognized based on the estimated
fair value of the tasks, when the tasks are completed;
2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet
product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized
at customer technical acceptance; 3) for transactions where
legal title does not transfer at shipment, revenue is recognized
when legal title passes to the customer, which is typically at
customer technical acceptance; and 4) for transactions
containing multiple deliverables, the unearned portion is
deferred until all four revenue recognition criteria have been
met. Applied allocates revenue from multiple element
arrangements to the various elements based upon relative fair
values, which are generally determined from price lists. A
provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded when
revenue is recognized. Applied’s shipping terms are
customarily FOB Applied shipping point or equivalent terms.
Spare parts revenue is generally recognized upon shipment.
License fees on software marketed as standalone products are
recognized upon shipment when all four revenue recognition
criteria have been met. Service revenue and software maintenance
fees are generally recognized ratably over the period of the
related contract. Prior to the implementation of the Securities
and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin
No. 101 (SAB 101), “Revenue Recognition in Financial
Statements,” in fiscal 2001, Applied generally recognized
revenue for established equipment upon shipment.

Change in Accounting
Policy

Applied implemented SAB 101
during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2001, retroactively
effective to the beginning of fiscal 2001. Since the
implementation of SAB 101 was retroactively effective to the
beginning of fiscal 2001, the first three fiscal quarters of
2001 were restated in the fiscal 2001 Annual Report on
Form 10-K. Applied recorded a cumulative effect of change
in accounting principle of $267 million (net of income tax
benefit of $112 million), or $0.16 per share, for the
restated first fiscal quarter of 2001. This charge represents
the after-tax difference between the new and previous revenue
recognition policies prior to fiscal 2001 as of the
implementation date at the beginning of fiscal 2001. Therefore,
no restatement of years prior to fiscal 2001 was required. For
periods prior to fiscal 2001, data was not available to provide
pro forma information as if the change in accounting principle
were applied retroactively. SAB 101 had no effect on
Applied’s revenue recognition policy for spare parts,
service, license fees on software marketed as standalone
products and software maintenance fees. The cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle of $267 million included
$651 million of revenue recognized prior to fiscal 2001, of
which $642 million was recognized during fiscal 2001. The
remaining $9 million of revenue was recognized during the
first fiscal quarter of 2002.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

Applied uses financial
instruments, such as forward exchange and currency option
contracts, to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and
anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected
to occur within 12 months. The terms of currency
instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent
with the timing of the transactions being hedged. The purpose of
Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the
effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. All of
Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at
fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable
instruments. For derivative instruments designated and
qualifying as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency
denominated transactions, the effective portion of the gain or
loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated
other comprehensive income in stockholders’ equity, and is
reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects
earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if
a portion of any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on
the associated financial instrument is recorded immediately in
earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing
foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or
loss on these hedges is recorded immediately in earnings to
offset the changes in the fair value of



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the assets or liabilities being hedged. Applied
does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or
speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency
Translation

Applied’s
subsidiaries, with the exception of the subsidiary located in
the United Kingdom, use the U.S. dollar as their functional
currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these
subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at
the end of the period, except for non-monetary assets, such as
inventories and property, plant and equipment, that are
translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs
are translated using average exchange rates for the period,
except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are
translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting
translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations as incurred. Applied’s subsidiary
located in the United Kingdom operates primarily using the
British pound, and therefore, the British pound has been
determined to be the functional currency for the United Kingdom.
Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of this subsidiary are
translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the
period, and revenues and costs are translated using average
exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation
adjustments are presented as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Prior to the second fiscal quarter of 2003,
Applied’s subsidiaries located in Japan and Europe operated
primarily using local currencies as their functional currencies.
During the second fiscal quarter of 2003, Applied reviewed the
functional currencies of its subsidiaries and determined that
the U.S. dollar was most appropriate for its subsidiaries
with the exception of its subsidiary located in the United
Kingdom. This determination was made as a result of changes in
facts, circumstances, scope of operations and business
practices. The change in the functional currencies did not have
a material effect on Applied’s business, results of
operations and financial position for fiscal 2003.

Stock-Based
Compensation

During the second fiscal
quarter of 2003, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
No. 148 (SFAS 148), “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation — Transition and Disclosure —
An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123” became
effective for Applied.

Applied measures compensation expense for its
stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method. As the exercise price of all options granted under
these plans was equal to the fair market price of the underlying
common stock on the grant date, no stock-based employee
compensation cost is recognized in the Consolidated Statements
of Operations.

In accordance with SFAS 148 and SFAS
No. 123 (SFAS 123), “Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation,” Applied’s pro forma option expense is
computed using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This
model was developed for use in estimating the value of publicly
traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully
transferable. Applied’s employee stock options have
characteristics significantly different from those of traded
options; therefore, in the opinion of management, the
Black-Scholes option pricing model generally used to comply with
SFAS 148 and SFAS 123 does not necessarily provide a reliable
measure of the fair value of Applied’s options.

To comply with SFAS 148, Applied is
presenting the following table to illustrate the effect on the
net income/(loss) and earnings/(loss) per share if it had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123,
as amended, to options granted under the stock-based employee
compensation plans. For purposes



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

of this pro forma disclosure, the estimated value
of the options is amortized ratably to expense over the
options’ vesting periods.

Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
the weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock
option grants was $8.98 for fiscal 2001, $10.87 for fiscal 2002
and $6.85 for fiscal 2003. The weighted average estimated fair
value of purchase rights granted under the Employees’ Stock
Purchase Plans (ESPP) was $6.26 for fiscal 2001, $6.29 for
fiscal 2002 and $5.31 for fiscal 2003. In calculating pro forma
compensation, the fair value of each stock option grant and
stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted
average assumptions:

For additional information on Applied’s
employee benefit plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Concentrations of Credit
Risk

Financial instruments that
potentially subject Applied to significant concentrations of
credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term
investments, trade accounts receivable and derivative financial
instruments used in hedging activities. Applied invests in a
variety of financial instruments, such as, but not limited to,
certificates of deposit, corporate and municipal bonds, and
U.S. Treasury and agency securities, and, by policy, limits
the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution
or commercial issuer. Applied’s customers consist of
semiconductor manufacturers located throughout the world.
Applied performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers’ financial condition and generally requires no
collateral to secure accounts receivable. Applied maintains a
reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based
on its assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable.
In addition, Applied may utilize letters of credit to mitigate
credit risk when considered appropriate. Applied is exposed to
credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but does not
expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is determined using the weighted
average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted
average number of common shares and equivalents (representing
the dilutive effect of stock options) outstanding during the
period.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

For purposes of computing diluted earnings per
share, weighted average common share equivalents do not include
stock options with an exercise price that exceeded the average
fair market value of Applied’s common stock for the period
as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options to purchase shares
of common stock that were excluded from the computation were as
follows:

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncement

In January 2003, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46
(FIN 46), “Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51.”
FIN 46 provides guidance on: 1) the identification of
entities for which control is achieved through means other than
through voting rights, known as “variable interest
entities” (VIEs); and 2) which business enterprise is
the primary beneficiary and when it should consolidate a VIE.
This new requirement for consolidation applies to entities:
1) where the equity investors (if any) do not have a
controlling financial interest; or 2) whose equity
investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s
activities without receiving additional subordinated financial
support from other parties. In addition, FIN 46 requires
that both the primary beneficiary and all other enterprises with
a significant variable interest in a VIE make additional
disclosures. FIN 46 is effective for all new VIEs created
or acquired after January 31, 2003. For VIEs created or
acquired prior to February 1, 2003, the provisions of
FIN 46 must be applied for the first interim or annual
period ending after December 15, 2003. Certain disclosures
are effective immediately. Applied will implement FIN 46
during the first fiscal quarter of 2004 and will consolidate
Applied Ventures I (Ventures I) as a VIE. Applied
does not expect its implementation to have a material effect on
its financial condition or results of operations. For additional
discussion of Ventures I, see Note 3 of the Notes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Investments

Short-term investments by security type at
October 26, 2003 were as follows:



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Short-term investments by security type at
October 27, 2002 were as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents included investments in
debt and other securities of $542 million at
October 27, 2002 and $884 million at October 26,
2003.

Contractual maturities of short-term investments
at October 26, 2003 were as follows:

For fiscal 2002, gross realized gains on sales of
short-term investments were $27 million, and gross realized
losses were not material. For fiscal 2003, gross realized gains
on sales of short-term investments were $44 million, and
gross realized losses were $8 million. Applied manages its
cash equivalents and short-term investments as a single
portfolio of highly marketable securities that is intended to be
available to meet Applied’s current cash requirements.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

Applied adopted SFAS
No. 133 (SFAS 133) “Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended, in the
first fiscal quarter of 2001. SFAS 133 established new standards
of accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and
hedging activities, and requires that all derivatives, including
foreign currency exchange contracts, be recognized on the
balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as
the ineffective portion of any hedges, must be recognized
currently in earnings. All of Applied’s derivative
financial instruments are recorded at their fair value in other
current assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses. The
transition adjustment upon adoption of SFAS 133 was not material.

Applied conducts business in a number of foreign
countries, with certain transactions denominated in local
currencies, such as Japanese yen, the euro, Israeli shekel and
British pound. The purpose of Applied’s foreign currency
management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues,
costs and eventual cash flows. The terms of currency instruments
used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the
timing of the transactions being hedged.

Applied uses derivative financial instruments,
such as forward exchange contracts and currency option
contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
denominated transactions expected to occur within the next
12 months. Hedges related to anticipated transactions are
designated and documented at the inception of



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

the hedge as cash flow hedges, and are evaluated
for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of the gain
or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’
equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged
transaction affects earnings. All such amounts included in
accumulated other comprehensive income at October 26, 2003
will be reclassified to earnings within 12 months. Changes
in the fair value of currency option contracts due to changes in
time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness,
and are recognized in cost of products sold. The change in
option time value was not material for fiscal 2001, 2002 or
2003. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a
portion of any derivative is ineffective, Applied immediately
recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial
instrument in general and administrative expenses. The amounts
recognized due to anticipated transactions failing to occur were
not material for all periods presented.

Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge
certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities.
These derivatives are not designated for SFAS 133 hedge
accounting treatment. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of
these hedges are recorded immediately in earnings to offset the
changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being
hedged.

Derivative-related activity in accumulated other
comprehensive income was as follows:

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

The carrying amounts of
Applied’s financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable, and accounts
payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to the
short maturities of these financial instruments. At
October 27, 2002, the carrying amount of long-term debt was
$583 million, and the estimated fair value was
$633 million. At October 26, 2003, the carrying amount
was $562 million, and the estimated fair value was
$625 million. The estimated fair value of long-term debt is
based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues.

Balance Sheet Detail

Goodwill, Purchased Technology and Other
    Intangible Assets

Details of unamortized intangible assets, which
consisted solely of goodwill, were as follows:

In connection with the adoption of SFAS 142,
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” as of the
beginning of fiscal 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized but
reviewed annually during the fourth fiscal quarter for
impairment. Applied conducted goodwill impairment tests in
fiscal 2002 and fiscal 2003, and the results of these tests
indicated that Applied’s goodwill assets were not impaired.
From October 27, 2002 to October 26, 2003, the change
in goodwill was $21 million, which primarily consisted of
$18 million for the acquisition of

Details of amortized intangible assets were as
follows:

Purchased technology and other intangible assets
are amortized over their estimated useful lives of five to
10 years using the straight-line method. Aggregate
amortization expense was $52 million and $48 million
for the fiscal 2002 and 2003, respectively. As of
October 26, 2003, future estimated amortization expense is
expected to be $49 million for fiscal 2004,
$20 million for fiscal 2005, $14 million for fiscal
2006, $5 million for fiscal 2007, $3 million for
fiscal 2008 and $2 million thereafter.

Applied Materials Venture Capital
    Fund

Ventures I invests in privately-held,
early-stage companies engaged in developing systems, components
and devices based on nanotechnology for specific applications
and products. Ventures I is a limited partnership with
Applied as the sole limited partner and an independent party as
the general partner. Applied has committed to fund
$50 million in capital contributions, but has reserved the
option to discontinue capital contributions at $25 million.
Applied’s capital contributions to Ventures I totaled
approximately $9 million through October 27, 2002 and
$16 million through October 26, 2003. As provided for
in the partnership agreement, the general partner has control
over investment decisions and operations of Ventures I.
Accordingly, Applied accounts for its investment using the
equity method. Capital contributions, net of the pro rata share
of Ventures I’s results of operations, have been
included in other assets and totaled $6 million at
October 27, 2002 and $11 million at October 26,
2003.

In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46 which
provides guidance on the identification, classification and
accounting of variable interest entities. Applied has determined
that Ventures I qualifies for consolidation as a variable
interest entity under FIN 46. Applied will implement FIN 46 by
consolidating Ventures I during the first fiscal quarter of 2004
in accordance with the effective date of FIN 46, as amended.
Applied does not expect the consolidation of Ventures I to have
a material impact on its financial condition or results of
operations.

Notes Payable

Applied has credit facilities for unsecured
borrowings in various currencies up to approximately
$674 million, of which $500 million is comprised of
two revolving credit agreements in the U.S. with a group of
banks. One agreement is a $250 million line of credit that
expires in September 2004, and is expected to be renewed, and
the other is a $250 million line of credit that expires in
September 2006. The agreements provide for borrowings at various
rates, including the lead bank’s prime reference rate, and
include financial and other covenants with which Applied was in
compliance at October 26, 2003. No amounts were outstanding
under these agreements at the end of fiscal 2003. The remaining
credit facilities of approximately $174 million are with
Japanese banks at rates indexed to their prime reference rate.
No amounts were outstanding under



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Japanese credit facilities at October 26,
2003. At October 27, 2002, $40 million was outstanding
under Japanese credit facilities at an average annual interest
rate of 0.30 percent.

Note 5

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt outstanding was as follows:

At October 26, 2003, $19 million of
Japanese debt was collateralized by property and equipment with
a net book value of $46 million.

Applied has debt agreements that contain
financial and other covenants. These covenants require Applied
to maintain certain minimum financial ratios. At
October 26, 2003, Applied was in compliance with all
covenants.

Aggregate debt maturities at October 26,
2003 were: $105 million in fiscal 2004; $46 million in
fiscal 2005; $2 million in fiscal 2006; $202 million
in fiscal 2007; $2 million in fiscal 2008; and
$205 million thereafter.

Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other
    Charges

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges included the following:

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges for fiscal 2001 totaled $221 million, consisting of
a charge of $10 million for acquired in-process research
and development expense, and restructuring and asset impairment
charges of $211 million. The restructuring and asset
impairment charges of $211 million consisted of
$105 million for headcount reductions, $45 million for
consolidation of facilities and $61 million for other
costs, primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility
consolidation. As of October 26, 2003, the majority of the
fiscal 2001 restructuring actions have been completed.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges for fiscal 2002 totaled $85 million, consisting of
a charge of $8 million for acquired in-process research and
development expense, and restructuring and asset impairment
charges of $77 million. The restructuring and asset
impairment charges consisted of $39 million for headcount
reductions, $16 million for consolidation of facilities and
$22 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset
writeoffs due to facility consolidation. As of October 26,
2003, the majority of the fiscal 2002 restructuring actions have
been completed.

Restructuring and asset impairment charges for
fiscal 2003 totaled $372 million, consisting of
$186 million for headcount reductions, $86 million for
consolidation of facilities and $100 million for other
costs, primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility
consolidation. The fiscal 2003 restructuring activities are
expected to be completed during early 2004, which will result in
additional costs.

The restructuring actions in fiscal 2001, 2002
and 2003 were taken to better align Applied’s cost
structure with prevailing market conditions due to the prolonged
industry downturn. These actions, which were necessary as a
result of reduced business volume, reduced Applied’s global
workforce and consolidated Applied’s global facilities.

Changes in restructuring reserves for fiscal 2002
and 2003 were as follows:

Stock Repurchase
Program

Since March 1996, Applied has
systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the
open market to partially fund its stock-based employee benefit
and incentive plans. Upon the expiration of the previous
authorization on March 22, 2001, the Board of Directors
extended the share repurchase program and authorized the
repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of Applied’s common
stock in the open market over the succeeding three years. In
fiscal 2001, there were 18,970,000 shares repurchased at an
average price of $19.58 per share. In fiscal 2002, there were
6,795,000 shares repurchased at an average price of $18.40 per
share. In fiscal 2003, there were 15,588,000 shares repurchased
at an average price of $16.03 per share.

Employee Benefit Plans

Stock Options

Applied grants options to employees and non-employee directors
to purchase shares of its common stock, at future dates, at the
fair market value on the date of grant. Options generally vest
over one to four years, and generally expire no later than seven
years from the date of grant. There were 83,946,000 shares
available for grant at October 28, 2001, 96,874,000 at
October 27, 2002 and 74,793,000 at October 26, 2003.

The following table summarizes information with
respect to options outstanding and exercisable at
October 26, 2003:

Employees’ Stock Purchase
Plan

Applied sponsors two
employees’ stock purchase plans for the benefit of
U.S. and international employees. The U.S. plan is
qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase
Applied’s common stock through payroll deductions at a
price equal to 85 percent of the lower of the fair market
value at the beginning of the offering period or at the end of
each applicable purchase period. Beginning in December 2002,
Applied amended the



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

ESPP to extend the offering period from six
months to 24 months composed of four six-month purchase
periods. ESPP contributions are limited to a maximum of
10 percent of an employee’s eligible compensation, up
to a maximum of $6,500, per six-month purchase period. ESPP
participants are also limited to purchasing a maximum of 1,000
shares per purchase period. Shares issued under the ESPP were
4,306,000 for fiscal 2001, 4,127,000 for fiscal 2002 and
6,212,000 for fiscal 2003. At October 26, 2003, there were
24,923,000 shares reserved for future issuance under the ESPP.

Stock-Based
Compensation

See Note 1 to Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Restricted Stock

During fiscal 2003, Applied issued 307,500 shares of restricted
stock to two individuals, which consisted principally of an
initial compensation package for Applied’s new President
and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). On May 20, 2003, Applied
issued 300,000 shares of restricted common stock at $0.01 per
share to the new President and CEO. The closing market price of
Applied’s common stock was $13.76 per share on May 20,
2003. One half of the shares vested on October 1, 2003,
with the remaining shares vesting on October 1, 2004. The
stock is subject to forfeiture if employment terminates prior to
vesting. Deferred compensation was charged for the difference
between the market value of the restricted shares and the sales
price, and was presented as a reduction of stockholders’
equity in Applied’s consolidated balance sheet. Deferred
compensation is amortized as compensation expense over the
vesting period. During fiscal 2003, Applied recognized general
and administrative expenses of approximately $2.7 million
in amortization expense related to restricted stock issuances.

Employee Bonus Plans

Applied has various employee bonus plans. A profit sharing plan
provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax profits
to substantially all Applied employees not eligible for other
performance-based incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of
compensation. Other plans award annual bonuses to Applied’s
executives and key contributors based on the achievement of
profitability and other specific performance criteria. Applied
also has agreements with key technical employees that provide
for additional compensation related to the success of new
product development and achievement of specified profitability
criteria. Charges to expense under these plans were
$56 million for fiscal 2001, $99 million for fiscal
2002 and not material for fiscal 2003.

Employee Savings and Retirement
Plan

The Employee Savings and
Retirement Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and
(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Applied contributes a
percentage of each participating employee’s salary deferral
contributions. These matching contributions become
20 percent vested at the end of an employee’s second
year of service with Applied, and vest 20 percent per year
of service thereafter until becoming fully vested at the end of
six years of service. Prior to January 1, 2002, company
matching contributions vested beginning at the end of an
employee’s third year of service and became fully vested at
the end of seven years of service. Effective January 1,
2004, each participant may elect to have his or her Company
matching contributions in any of the diversified investment
funds available under the plan or in Applied’s common
stock. Applied’s matching contributions under this plan
were $31 million for fiscal 2001, $27 million for
fiscal 2002, and $13 million, net of $12 million in
forfeitures for fiscal 2003. Forfeitures were not material for
fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2002.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign
Subsidiaries

Several of Applied’s
foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all of their eligible employees. Benefits under
these plans are based on years of service and final average
compensation levels. Applied has funded its plans in accordance
with the terms of the plans and local statutory requirements,
which differ for each of the countries in which the subsidiaries
are located. Expenses under these plans, consisting principally
of service cost, were $12 million for fiscal 2001,
$16 million for fiscal 2002 and $18 million for fiscal
2003. At October 26, 2003, the aggregate accumulated
benefit obligation was $102 million, the projected benefit
obligation was $123 million, and the fair value of plan
assets was $33 million. The difference between the
aggregate accumulated benefit obligation and aggregate plan
assets has been recorded as a liability by Applied.

Post-Retirement
Benefits

On January 1, 1999,
Applied adopted a plan that provides medical and vision benefits
to retirees who are at least age 55 and whose age plus years of
service is at least 65 at date of retirement. An eligible
retiree may elect coverage for a spouse or domestic partner
under the age of 65. Coverage under the plan generally ends for
both the retiree and spouse or domestic partner upon reaching
age 65. This plan has not had, and is not expected to have, a
material effect on Applied’s financial condition or results
of operations.

APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Applied’s effective income tax rate was
lower in fiscal 2002 due primarily to significant Foreign Sales
Corporation and extraterritorial income tax benefits, which
resulted from an increase in Foreign Sales Corporation and
extraterritorial qualified income.

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects
of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for income tax purposes. The components of net deferred
income tax assets were as follows:

U.S. income taxes have not been provided for
approximately $291 million of cumulative undistributed
earnings of several non-U.S. subsidiaries. Applied intends
to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of
the U.S.

At October 26, 2003, Applied’s federal
and state net operating loss carryforwards for tax return
purposes was $642 million and $174 million,
respectively. Management believes that net operating losses will
be utilized in future periods. If not utilized, the federal net
operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2023
and the state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to
expire in fiscal 2008. As of October 26, 2003,
Applied’s federal tax credit carryforwards for tax return
purposes were $97 million. If not utilized, the federal tax
credit carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2006.

Applied’s income taxes payable have been
reduced, and deferred tax assets have been increased, by the tax
benefits associated with employee stock option transactions.
These benefits, credited directly to stockholders’ equity,
amounted to $75 million for fiscal 2002 and
$124 million for fiscal 2003. Benefits reducing taxes
payable amounted to $75 million for fiscal 2002, and
benefits increasing deferred tax assets amounted to
$124 million for fiscal 2003.

Industry Segment and Foreign
    Operations

Applied operates in one segment for the
manufacture, marketing and servicing of integrated circuit
fabrication equipment. In accordance with SFAS No. 131
(SFAS 131), “Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,” Applied’s chief
operating decision-maker has been identified as the President
and Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to
make decisions about allocating

resources and assessing performance for the
entire company. All material operating units qualify for
aggregation under SFAS 131 due to their identical customer base
and similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of
products and services; and procurement, manufacturing and
distribution processes. Since Applied operates in one segment
and in one group of similar products and services, all financial
segment and product line information required by SFAS 131
can be found in the consolidated financial statements.

For geographical reporting, revenues are
attributed to the geographic location in which the
customers’ facilities are located. Long-lived assets
consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, and are
attributed to the geographic location in which they are located.
Net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region were as
follows:

Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

Applied leases some of its facilities and
equipment under non-cancelable operating leases and has options
to renew most leases, with rentals to be negotiated. At
October 27, 2002, Applied leased office and general
operating facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon under a synthetic
lease agreement. Applied purchased these facilities for
$52 million during fiscal 2003.

Total rent expense was $153 million for
fiscal 2001, $140 million for fiscal 2002 and
$134 million for fiscal 2003. Future minimum lease payments
at October 26, 2003 were: $111 million for fiscal
2004; $82 million for fiscal 2005; $60 million for
fiscal 2006; $43 million for fiscal 2007; $35 million
for fiscal 2008; and $147 million thereafter.

Accounts Receivables Sales

Applied has several agreements that allow it to
sell accounts receivable from selected customers at a discount
to various financial institutions. Receivable sales have the
effect of increasing cash and reducing accounts receivable and
days sales outstanding. Discounting fees were recorded in
interest expense and were not material for fiscal 2001, 2002 or
2003. Accounts receivable sales under these agreements were
$1.2 billion for fiscal 2001, $689 million for fiscal
2002 and $556 million for fiscal 2003. At October 26,
2003, $168 million of sold receivables remained outstanding
under these agreements. A portion of these sold receivables is
subject to certain limited recourse provisions. However, Applied
has not experienced any losses under these recourse provisions.

Guarantees

Applied adopted FASB Interpretation No. 45
(FIN 45), “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure
Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Indebtedness of
Others,” during the first fiscal quarter of 2003. FIN 45
requires disclosures concerning Applied’s obligations under
certain guarantees.

Pursuant to FIN 45, Applied is required to
disclose the changes in product warranty reserves. Applied
products are generally sold with a 12-month warranty period
following installation. Parts and labor are covered under the
terms of the warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based
on historical experience by product, configuration and
geographic region.

Changes in the warranty reserves were as follows
(in thousands):

As noted above, Applied’s products are
generally sold with a 12-month warranty. Accordingly, current
warranty provisions are related to the current year’s net
sales, and warranty consumption is associated with current and
prior year’s net sales.

During the ordinary course of business, Applied
also provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee
instruments to certain parties as required for certain
transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

As of October 26, 2003, the maximum
potential amount of future payments that Applied could be
required to make under these guarantee agreements was
approximately $56 million. Applied has not recorded any
liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond
that required to appropriately account for the underlying
transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on
historical experience and information currently available, that
it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid
under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has additional guarantee
arrangements on behalf of certain subsidiaries. As of
October 26, 2003, Applied has not recorded any liability
related to guarantees of subsidiary obligations. Applied does
not expect, based on historical experience and information
currently available, that it is probable any amounts will be
required to be paid under these arrangements. Subsidiary
guarantees as of October 26, 2003 were associated with the
following types of arrangements: short-term borrowings, term
loans, overdrafts and leases. While certain subsidiaries have
short-term borrowing, term loans and overdraft facilities
available totaling approximately $169 million as of
October 26, 2003, no amounts were outstanding as of
October 26, 2003. In the event of use and subsequent
default of these facilities by Applied’s subsidiaries, such
arrangements would be guaranteed by Applied. In addition,
certain subsidiaries have lease arrangements guaranteed by
Applied. These leases will expire between 2009 and 2014. In the
event that the subsidiaries do not make the required payments,
Applied could be required to pay the leases on behalf of the
subsidiaries. As of October 26, 2003, annual lease
obligations under these arrangements approximated
$12 million.

Legal Matters

On June 13, 1997, after Varian Associates,
Inc. (Varian) failed to respond to requests by Applied to
discuss certain patent issues, Applied filed a lawsuit against
Varian alleging infringement of several of Applied’s
patents concerning physical vapor deposition (PVD) technology.
On July 7, 1997, Applied amended that action to allege
infringement of those same Applied PVD patents against Novellus
Systems, Inc. (Novellus) and to add Novellus as a defendant, as
a result of Novellus’ acquisition of Varian’s thin
film systems PVD business. On June 23, 1997, Novellus filed
a separate lawsuit against Applied, alleging infringement by
Applied of several PVD technology patents that were formerly
owned by Varian. Novellus seeks damages for past infringement, a
permanent injunction, treble damages for willful infringement,
pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees. In September
2000, Applied and Varian settled their disputes, and Applied
released all claims with respect to the Inova System as it was
made and sold as of May 7, 1997. On October 3, 2000,
Applied’s claims against Varian and Varian’s claims
and counterclaims against Applied were dismissed with prejudice.
The litigation with Novellus continues. Discovery has closed in
the actions. The court has rescheduled the previously set trial
date from January 20, 2004 to May 24, 2004. Applied
believes the May trial will involve only infringement and
validity issues regarding Novellus’ patent claims against
Applied and Applied’s declaratory judgment claims against
Novellus’ patents. Applied believes it has meritorious
claims and defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

On January 8, 2001, Axcelis Technologies,
Inc. (Axcelis), formerly a subsidiary of Eaton Corporation,
filed a lawsuit alleging that Applied infringes a patent
concerning ion implantation owned by Axcelis. The complaint also
alleges various Massachusetts state and common law tortious
interference and unfair competition claims. Axcelis seeks a
preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, costs and
attorneys’ fees. On April 12, 2001, Applied answered
the complaint by denying all allegations and counterclaimed for
declaratory judgment of invalidity and non-infringement, and
violations of various unfair and deceptive trade practices laws.
Applied seeks damages, a permanent injunction, costs and
attorneys’ fees. On July 2, 2003, a jury ruled in
favor of Applied, returning a verdict that Applied’s
Swift

TM

ion implantation system does not infringe
Axcelis’ patent. The court has entered judgment in favor of
Applied on Axcelis’ patent claim. Axcelis has filed a
notice of appeal and the appeal is proceeding. The state law
claims have not yet been resolved. Applied believes it has
meritorious defenses and counterclaims to the action and intends
to pursue them vigorously.

(LTC) filed a lawsuit against Applied alleging claims for breach
of contract, fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation,
suppression of fact, unfair competition, breach of warranty,
express contractual indemnity, implied equitable indemnity and
declaratory relief. After the court dismissed many of its
claims, LTC amended its complaint to allege claims only for
fraud and deceit and violation of California Business and
Professions Code §17200. In the amended complaint, LTC
seeks compensatory damages, punitive damages, injunctive relief
and restitution. LTC also seeks costs and attorneys’ fees,
and also asserts similar claims against certain other

On June 11, 2001, Semitool, Inc. (Semitool)
filed a lawsuit in California alleging that Applied infringes a
patent concerning seed repair and electroplating owned by
Semitool. Semitool sought a preliminary and permanent
injunction, damages, costs and attorneys’ fees. On
July 12, 2001, Semitool dismissed the California action and
filed a substantially identical lawsuit in Oregon. On
July 13, 2001, Applied filed a declaratory judgment action
against Semitool seeking a declaration that Applied has not
infringed the Semitool patent and that Semitool’s patent is
invalid and unenforceable. Applied also seeks costs and
attorneys’ fees. The actions are proceeding together in
Oregon. Semitool has also asserted similar claims against
certain other semiconductor equipment manufacturers. The Oregon
Court has issued an order interpreting the patent claims and has
scheduled a trial date of February 3, 2004. Applied
believes it has meritorious claims and defenses and intends to
pursue them vigorously.

On July 31, 2001, David Scharf, an
individual, filed a lawsuit against Applied alleging that
Applied has infringed, has induced others to infringe and has
contributed to others’ infringement of a patent concerning
color synthesizing scanning electron microscope technology.
Mr. Scharf seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction,
damages and costs. Applied has answered the complaint and
counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and
invalidity. On May 10, 2002, Mr. Scharf filed a
request for re-examination of his patent with the Patent and
Trademark Office. On June 26, 2002, the case was removed
from the Court’s active docket after the parties stipulated
to stay the case pending the results of that re-examination. On
July 11, 2002, Applied filed its own request for
re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with the Patent
and Trademark Office. Applied’s request for re-examination
was granted on September 19, 2002. Applied believes it has
meritorious defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue
them vigorously.

On August 27, 2002, ASM America, Inc. and
ASM International, N.V. (collectively ASMI) filed a lawsuit
against Applied seeking a judicial declaration that ASMI does
not infringe six patents belonging to Applied that relate to
remote cleaning of CVD chambers and to deposition of silicon
nitride. The suit also seeks a judicial declaration that the six
patents are invalid. Applied responded to the complaint by
denying the allegations and asserting counterclaims for
infringement of the six parents. No trial date has been set.
Applied believes it has meritorious defenses and counterclaims
and intends to pursue them vigorously.

On October 3, 2003, ASMI filed a lawsuit
against Applied claiming that Applied infringes six ASMI
patents. ASMI seeks damages for past infringement, enhanced
damages, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys’ fees.
Applied responded to the complaint by denying the allegations
and asserting counterclaims for invalidity, unenforceability and
non-infringement of the ASMI patents. Applied also asserted
counterclaims for infringement of the six Applied patents at
issue in the ASMI-Arizona case and one additional patent.
Applied seeks injunctive relief, compensatory and enhance
damages, costs and attorneys’ fees. No trial date has been
set. Applied believes it has meritorious defenses and
counterclaims and intends to pursue them vigorously.

On September 13, 2002, Varian Semiconductor
Equipment Associates, Inc. filed a demand for arbitration with
the American Arbitration Association asserting that Applied has
breached a patent license agreement between Varian and Applied
dated January 1, 1992. Varian seeks to recover royalties,
interest and attorneys’ fees. The arbitration hearing on
whether the products are covered by the license agreement has
concluded. On May 2, 2003, the arbitration panel issued an
interim decision finding that some, but not all, of the products
at issue were subject to the agreement. The arbitration panel
next will consider whether the

products were found to be covered are valid. Applied believes
that it has meritorious defenses and intends to pursue them
vigorously.

On October 10, 2002, Robert Bosch GmbH
(Bosch), a German company, filed a lawsuit against Applied
alleging that Applied infringed two patents owned by Bosch
related to anisotropic etching. Bosch sought a preliminary and
permanent injunction, damages, costs and attorneys’ fees.
Applied answered the complaint and counterclaimed for
declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. The
parties have settled the litigation and all claims and
counterclaims have been dismissed with prejudice.

From time to time, Applied receives notification
from customers claiming that such customers are entitled to
indemnification or other obligations from Applied related to
infringement claims made against the customers by third parties.
In addition, Applied is subject to various other legal
proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that
arise in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome
of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does
not believe that any of these other existing legal matters will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or
results of operations.

Business Combinations

On April 18, 2003, Applied acquired Boxer
Cross, Inc., a producer of in-line monitoring systems that
provide customers with critical electrical measurement data for
controlling semiconductor processes, for $14 million in
cash. In connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded
goodwill of $18 million, net of adjustments to the initial
purchase price allocation, and purchased technology of
$3 million, partially offset by other items of
$7 million, primarily for deferred tax assets and other
liabilities. The in-process research and development expense was
insignificant.

On April 8, 2002, Applied acquired Electron
Vision Corporation, a designer, manufacturer and seller of
e-beam stabilization and curing tools for the semiconductor,
thin film head and micro-fabrication industries, for
$26 million in cash. In connection with this acquisition,
Applied recorded goodwill of $13 million, net of
adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation, and
purchased technology of $16 million, partially offset by
other items of $3 million, primarily for deferred tax
liabilities.

On December 3, 2001, Applied acquired Global
Knowledge Services, Inc., a provider of advanced data mining
services to improve semiconductor manufacturing yield and
efficiency, for $16 million in cash. In connection with
this acquisition, Applied recorded acquired in-process research
and development expense of $2 million, goodwill of
$6 million, purchased technology of $4 million and
other items of $4 million. The amount of acquired
in-process research and development expense was determined by
identifying research projects for which technological
feasibility had not been established and for which no
alternative future use existed. The value of the projects
identified as in-process was determined by estimating the future
cash flows from the projects once commercially feasible,
discounting the net cash flows back to their present value at a
rate commensurate with the level of risk and maturity of the
projects, and then applying a percentage of completion to the
calculated value.

On November 20, 2001, Applied acquired the
assets of Schlumberger’s electron-beam wafer inspection
business for $66 million in cash. In connection with this
acquisition, Applied recorded acquired in-process research and
development expense of $6 million and goodwill of
$81 million, net of adjustments to the initial purchase
price allocation, partially offset by net liabilities acquired
of $21 million. The amount of acquired in-process research
and development expense was determined by identifying research
projects for which technological feasibility had not been
established and for which no alternative future use existed. The
value of the projects identified as in-process was determined by
calculating the total development costs incurred, estimating the
portion of development costs related to the aspect of the
project that Applied expects to utilize, and then calculating
the current value of these historical development costs using a
Consumer Price Index adjustment.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On June 27, 2001, Applied acquired Oramir, a
supplier of advanced laser cleaning technologies for
semiconductor wafers, in a purchase business combination for
$21 million in cash. In connection with this acquisition,
Applied recorded acquired in-process research and development
expense of $10 million and goodwill of $12 million.
The amount of acquired in-process research and development
expense was determined by identifying research projects for
which technological feasibility had not been established and for
which no alternative future uses existed. The value of the
projects identified to be in-process was determined by
estimating the future cash flows from the projects once
commercially feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to
their present value at a rate commensurate with the level of
risk and maturity of the projects, and then applying a
percentage of completion to the calculated value.

For all of the purchase business combinations
discussed above, the results of operations prior to the
acquisition dates were not material in relation to those of
Applied for any of the periods presented herein. Goodwill is not
amortized but is reviewed periodically for impairment, in
accordance with SFAS 142, and purchased technology is
amortized over its useful life of five to ten years. These
acquisitions have not had, and are not expected to have, a
material effect on Applied’s financial condition or results
of operations.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

Management is responsible for the preparation and
integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial statements
were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America appropriate under the
circumstances and, accordingly, include some amounts based on
management’s best judgments and estimates. Financial
information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is
consistent with that in the financial statements.

Management is responsible for maintaining a
system of internal business controls and procedures to provide
reasonable assurance, at an appropriate cost/benefit
relationship, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions
are authorized, recorded and reported properly. The internal
control system is augmented by appropriate reviews by
management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection
and training of qualified personnel and a written code of
business ethics applicable to all employees of Applied and its
subsidiaries. Management believes that Applied’s internal
controls provide reasonable assurance that assets are
safeguarded against material loss from unauthorized use or
disposition and that the financial records are reliable for
preparing financial statements and other data and maintaining
accountability for assets.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors,
composed solely of Directors who are not employees or officers
of Applied, meets on a regular periodic basis with the
independent auditors, internal auditors and management to
discuss internal business controls, auditing and financial
reporting matters. The Committee reviews with the independent
auditors the scope and results of the audit effort. The
Committee also meets with the independent auditors without
management present to ensure that the independent auditors have
free access to the Audit Committee.

The independent auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP, are engaged to audit the consolidated financial statements
of Applied and to conduct such tests and related procedures as
they deem necessary in accordance with generally accepted
auditing standards. The opinion of the independent auditors,
based upon their audits of the consolidated financial
statements, is contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,

significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
