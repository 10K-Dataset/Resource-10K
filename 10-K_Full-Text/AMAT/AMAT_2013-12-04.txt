APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

FORM 10-K FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 27, 2013




PART I

Item 1:

Business

Incorporated in 1967, Applied, a Delaware corporation, provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar photovoltaic (PV) and related industries. Applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, flat panel liquid crystal and other displays, solar PV cells and modules, and other electronic devices. These customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. Applied’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October.

Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. Applied manages its business based upon these segments. A summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that could affect operations is set forth under “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

In November 2011, Applied completed the acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian), a leading supplier of ion implantation equipment to the semiconductor and solar industries. The acquisition expanded Applied's technologies for chip and solar module manufacturing. The acquired business is primarily included in consolidated results of operations and the results of the Silicon Systems Group and Applied Global Services segments.

Net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Silicon Systems Group Segment

The Silicon Systems Group segment develops, manufactures and sells manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips, also referred to as integrated circuits (ICs). Most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of circuit components, such as transistors and other devices, that are connected by multiple layers of wiring (interconnects). Applied offers systems that perform various processes used in chip fabrication, including atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), electrochemical deposition (ECD), rapid thermal processing (RTP), ion implantation, chemical mechanical planarization (CMP), wet cleaning, and wafer metrology and inspection, as well as systems that etch or inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process. Applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are used by integrated device manufacturers and foundries to build and package memory, logic and other types of chips.

The majority of the Company's new equipment sales are for leading-edge technology for advanced nodes using 28 nanometer (nm) and smaller dimensions. To build a chip, the transistors, capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively remove portions of successive film layers. Similar processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer. As the density of the circuit components increases to enable greater computing capability in the same or smaller physical area, the complexity of building the chip also increases, necessitating more process steps to form smaller transistor structures and more intricate wiring schemes. Advanced chip designs require more than 500 steps involving these and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle.

Today's advanced interconnects are made using copper as the main wiring material. Copper has low resistance and can carry a large amount of current in a small area, which allows signals to travel quickly. Applied is a leading supplier of systems for manufacturing copper-based interconnects, including equipment for depositing, etching and planarizing these multi-layer structures.



To increase the speed of interconnect signals even further, low dielectric constant (low k) films are used to insulate the copper wiring. Applied provides systems for depositing low k dielectric films that enable higher device performance and longer battery life.

The transistor is another key area of the chip where semiconductor manufacturers are improving their device designs to enhance performance. Applied has technically advanced products for building smaller and faster transistors. One method of enhancing chip performance is strain engineering, a technique that stretches or compresses the space between atoms, allowing electrical current to flow more quickly. Multiple strain films are typically used in advanced devices since they have an additive effect on increasing transistor speed. Applied has systems to enable these applications using CVD and epitaxial deposition technologies.

Major chipmakers are integrating high dielectric constant (high-k) and metal materials and processes in their transistor gate structures to increase chip performance and reduce power consumption. Applied has fully characterized processes for building these high-k/metal gates. These solutions include an integrated dielectric gate stack tool that combines four critical processes in a single system, a portfolio of metallization technologies using ALD and PVD, and an innovative high temperature etch system.

To address the need for higher performance in a smaller space driven by new consumer products, a new type of chip packaging at wafer level is emerging, which enables three-dimensional (3D) ICs. Providing greater functionality in a smaller footprint, 3D ICs stack multiple chips together and electrically connect them using deep holes, called through-silicon via (TSV) structures. Applied has production-proven systems and processes required for advanced packaging manufacturing, including etch, CVD, PVD, ECD, wafer cleaning and CMP systems.

Most of Applied’s semiconductor equipment products are single-wafer systems with multiple process chambers attached to a base platform. This enables each wafer to be processed separately in its own environment, allowing precise process control, while the system’s multiple chambers enable simultaneous, high productivity manufacturing. Applied sells most of its single-wafer, multi-chamber systems on six basic platforms: the Endura

®,

, Centura

®

, Producer

®

, Raider

®

, VIISta

®

and Vantage

®

platforms. These platforms support ALD, CVD, ECD, PVD, etch, ion implantation, and RTP technologies.

Over time, the semiconductor industry has migrated to increasingly larger wafers to build chips. The predominant or common wafer size used today for volume production of advanced chips is 300 millimeter (mm), or 12-inch, wafers. Applied offers 300mm systems through its Silicon Systems Group segment. The Company also offers earlier-generation 200mm systems, as well as products and services to support all of its systems, which are reported under its Applied Global Services segment.

The following discusses in more detail the portfolio of products and their associated process technology areas reported under the Silicon Systems Group segment.

Deposition

Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a chip. During deposition, layers of dielectric (an insulator), barrier, or electrically conductive (typically metal) films are deposited or grown on a wafer. Applied provides equipment to perform four types of deposition: ALD, CVD, ECD and PVD. In addition, Applied’s RTP systems can be used to perform certain types of dielectric deposition.

Atomic Layer Deposition

ALD is an advanced technology in which atoms are deposited one layer at a time to build chip structures. This technology enables customers to fabricate thin films of either conducting or insulating material with uniform coverage in nanometer-sized structures. One of the most critical areas of the transistor is its gate, which is built by depositing layers of dielectric films. At the 22nm node and below, these film layers are so thin that they must be atomically engineered. The Applied Centura Integrated Gate Stack system features advanced ALD technology that builds ultrathin high-k film layers less than 2nm in thickness — about one hundred thousandth the width of a human hair.



Chemical Vapor Deposition

CVD is used to deposit dielectric and metal films on a wafer. During the CVD process, gases that contain atoms of the material to be deposited react on the wafer surface, forming a thin film of solid material. Films deposited by CVD may be silicon oxide, single-crystal epitaxial silicon, amorphous silicon, silicon nitride, dielectric anti-reflective coatings, low k dielectric (for highly-efficient insulating materials), aluminum, titanium, titanium nitride, polysilicon, tungsten, refractory metals or silicides. Applied offers the following CVD products and technologies:

The Applied Producer CVD platform

— The Producer high-throughput platform features Twin-Chamber

®

modules that have two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up to three Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer platform, giving it a simultaneous processing capacity of six wafers. Many dielectric CVD processes can be performed on this platform. The highest productivity model of this system is the Applied Producer GT, which features fast wafer handling performance and compact design.

Low k Dielectric Films

— Low k dielectric materials are used in copper-based chip designs to further improve interconnect speed. Using conventional CVD equipment, the Applied Producer Black Diamond

®

family of low k systems provides customers with a proven, cost-effective way to integrate a variety of low k films into advanced interconnect structures. The Company's latest third-generation low k technologies are featured on the Applied Producer Black Diamond 3 system and Applied Producer Nanocure 3 system. In addition, the Company offers its Applied Producer

®

Onyx

TM

process, an innovative film treatment that optimizes the molecular structure of low k films. Together, these products are designed to enable smaller, higher performance and more power-efficient devices at 22nm and below.

Lithography-Enabling Solutions

— Applied offers several technologies on the Producer system to help chipmakers extend their current 193nm lithography tools, including a line of Applied APF

®

(advanced patterning film) films and Applied DARC

®

(dielectric anti-reflective coating) films. Together, they provide a film stack with the precise dimensional control and compatibility needed to cost-effectively pattern nano-scale features without additional integration complexity.

Gap Fill Films

— There are many steps during the chipmaking process in which extremely small and deep, or high aspect ratio (HAR), structures must be filled void-free with a dielectric film. Many of these applications include the deposition of silicon oxides in substrate isolation structures, contacts and interconnects. Applied's most advanced gap fill system is its Applied Producer Eterna™ FCVD™ system. Targeted for 20nm and below chips, the Eterna system delivers a liquid-like film that flows freely into virtually any structure to provide void-free dielectric fill.

Strain Engineering Solutions

— The Applied Producer HARP™ system plays a key role in enhancing transistor performance, enabling chipmakers to boost chip speed by depositing strain-inducing dielectric films. Offering the industry’s first integrated stress nitride deposition and ultraviolet (UV) cure solution, the Applied Producer Celera CVD delivers benchmark levels of high-stress tensile silicon nitride films. The Company also offers the Applied Centura SiNgenPlus low pressure CVD system for low temperature silicon nitride films. Used together, and in conjunction with silicon germanium (SiGe) films using Applied’s epitaxial deposition technologies, these systems can provide additive strain engineering benefits.

Through-Silicon Via Films

— Applied offers products for TSV fabrication, including the Applied Producer InVia™ system. This product uses an innovative process to deposit the critical oxide liner film layer in HAR TSV structures, enabling robust electrical isolation of the TSV, which is vital for reliable device performance. For applications where higher temperatures can damage the manufacturing process, the Applied Producer Avila™ CVD system and Applied Producer Optiva CVD system allow high quality dielectric film deposition at stable substrate temperatures at a low cost of ownership.

Epitaxial Deposition

— Epitaxial silicon (epitaxy or epi) is a layer of pure silicon grown in a uniform crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high quality base for the device circuitry. Epi technology is used in an increasing number of IC devices in both the wafer substrate and transistor areas of a chip to enhance speed. The Applied Centura Epi system integrates pre- and post-epi processes on the same system to improve film quality and reduce production costs. This system is also used for SiGe epi technology, which reduces power usage and increases speed in certain types of advanced chips. For emerging transistor designs, the Applied Centura RP Epi system offers selective epi processes to enable faster transistor switching through strain engineering techniques.



Polysilicon Deposition

— Polysilicon is a type of silicon used to form portions of the transistor structure within the IC device. The Applied Centura Polygen™ LPCVD system is a single-wafer, multi-chamber product that deposits thin polysilicon films at high temperatures to create transistor gate structures. To address the challenging requirements of shrinking gate dimensions, the Applied Centura DPN Gate Stack system integrates chambers for decoupled plasma nitridation (DPN), RTP anneal, and polysilicon deposition on one platform to enable superior film quality and material properties.

Tungsten Deposition

— Tungsten is used in the contact area of a chip that connects the transistors to the wiring circuitry. In aluminum-based devices, tungsten is also used in the structures that connect the multiple layers of aluminum wiring. Applied has two products for depositing tungsten: the Applied Centura Sprint

®

Tungsten CVD system and the Applied Centura iSprint ALD/CVD system which provide tungsten filling capability to 20nm and below.

Electrochemical Deposition

ECD is a process by which metal atoms from a chemical fluid (an electrolyte) are deposited on the surface of an immersed object. One application is to deposit copper in interconnect wiring structures. This process step follows the deposition of barrier and seed layers which prevent the copper from contaminating other areas of the device, improve the adhesion of the copper film and enable electrodeposition to occur. Another application is wafer level packaging for deposition of copper to fill TSV 3D chip-to-chip connections. Applied offers special configurations of the Applied Raider system for these ECD applications.

Physical Vapor Deposition

PVD is a physical process in which atoms of a gas, such as argon, are accelerated toward a metal target. The metal atoms chip off, or sputter away, and are then deposited on the wafer. The Applied Endura PVD system offers various advanced metal deposition processes, including aluminum, aluminum alloys, cobalt, titanium/titanium nitride, tantalum/tantalum nitride, tungsten/tungsten nitride, nickel, vanadium and copper. Introduced 23 years ago, the Company's Applied Endura platform is the most successful metal deposition system in the history of the semiconductor industry.

The Applied Endura CuBS (copper barrier/seed) PVD system is widely used by customers for fabricating copper-based chips. Using PVD technology, the system deposits a tantalum-based barrier film that prevents copper material from entering other areas of the device and then a copper seed layer that primes the structure for the subsequent deposition of bulk copper. The Applied Endura CuBS RFX PVD system extends cost-effective CuBS technology to the 22nm node. The Applied Endura Avenir™ RF PVD system sequentially deposits the multiple metal film layers that form the heart of the industry’s new, faster, metal gate transistors. The Applied Endura iLB PVD/ALD system advances the state-of-the-art in ALD technology, enabling customers to shrink their speed-critical contact structures for 20nm and below devices. The Applied Endura Amber

TM

PVD system uses copper reflow technology to achieve rapid, void-free fill of interconnect structures at virtually any device node.

Applied’s Endura system has also been used for many years in back-end applications to deposit metal layers before final bump or wire bonding packaging steps are performed. Additionally, the Applied Charger

®

UBM PVD system, which is specifically designed for under-bump metallization (UBM) and other back-end processes, features linear architecture for reliable performance and very high productivity at a low cost per wafer.

Etch

Etching is used many times throughout the IC manufacturing process to selectively remove material from the surface of a wafer. Before etching begins, the wafer is coated with a light-sensitive film, called photoresist. A photolithography process then projects the circuit pattern onto the wafer. Etching removes material only from areas dictated by the photoresist pattern. Applied offers systems for etching dielectric, metal, and silicon films to meet the requirements of advanced processing.

For etching silicon, the Applied Centris AdvantEdge™ Mesa™ system features eight process chambers for high wafer output and proprietary system intelligence software to assure every process on every chamber precisely matches. The system also saves on power, water and gas consumption, helping customers to lower operating costs and support their sustainable manufacturing initiatives. Chip manufacturers are also beginning to employ 3D architectures in advance memory chips to provide higher-density storage capacity. These structures require the precise etching of exceptionally deep and narrow structures. To meet this industry requirement, Applied offers its Applied Centura Avatar

TM

dielectric etch system that can etch holes and trenches up to 80:1 depth-to-width aspect ratios. Also for 3D chip manufacturing, the Applied Centura Silvia

®

system is specifically designed for etching small, deep holes for TSV applications.



Rapid Thermal Processing

RTP is a process in which a wafer is subjected to rapid bursts of intense heat that can take the wafer from room temperature to more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in less than 10 seconds. A rapid thermal process is used mainly for annealing, which modifies the properties of deposited films. The Applied Centura Radiance

®

Plus

and Applied Vantage RadOx™ RTP systems feature advanced RTP technology with differing platform designs. While the multi-chamber Centura platform offers exceptional process flexibility, the streamlined two-chamber Vantage platform is designed for dedicated high-volume manufacturing. These single-wafer RTP systems are also used for growing high quality oxide and oxynitride films, deposition steps that traditional large batch furnaces can no longer achieve with the necessary precision and control.

Applied’s latest RTP systems address the critical need for controlling wafer temperature to increase chip performance and yield. The laser-based Applied Vantage Astra™ millisecond anneal system abruptly raises the surface temperature of the wafer locally to modify material properties at the atomic level. The Applied Vantage Vulcan system, the first RTP system to heat the wafer entirely from the backside, brings a new level of precision and control to the anneal process, allowing chipmakers to produce more high performance devices per wafer.

Ion Implantation

Ion implantation is a key technology for forming transistors and is used many times during chip fabrication. During ion implantation, wafers are bombarded by a beam of electrically-charged ions, called dopants, which change the electrical properties of the exposed surface films. These dopants are accelerated to an energy that permits them to penetrate the substrate at a precise quantity and depth. Dopant concentration is determined by controlling the number of ions in the beam and the number of times the wafer passes through the beam; the depth of the dopants is determined by the energy of beam. Ion implantation systems may also be used in other areas of IC manufacturing to modify the material properties of the semiconductor devices, as well as in manufacturing crystalline-silicon solar cells.

Applied offers a line of single-wafer ion implantation equipment that covers the entire energy and current range required to manufacture advanced devices. The VIISta 3000XP implanter delivers the angle precision required for advanced high-energy applications, while the VIISta 900XP implanter provides medium current precision doping. The VIISta PLAD implanter enables manufacturers to rapidly implant high dopant concentrations over the entire wafer using a low-energy process that preserves sensitive circuit features in next-generation devices. The VIISta Trident high current ion implanter provides the precise dose and angle control needed for advanced transistor structures.

Chemical Mechanical Planarization

The CMP process removes material from a wafer to create a flat (planarized) surface. This process allows subsequent photolithography patterning and material deposition steps to occur with greater accuracy, resulting in more highly uniform film layers with minimal thickness variations. Applied has led the industry with its 300mm Applied Reflexion

®

LK system, with features such as integrated cleaning, film measurement and process control capabilities. Applied’s latest CMP product, the Applied Reflexion GT system, has an innovative dual-wafer design that increases performance while lowering system cost of ownership in fabricating copper interconnects and tungsten contacts.



Metrology and Wafer Inspection

Applied offers several products for measuring features and inspecting defects on the wafer during various stages of the fabrication process. These systems enable customers to characterize and control critical dimension (CD) and defect issues, especially at advanced generation technology nodes.

Critical Dimension and Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscopes (CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs) —

Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an electron beam to form images of microscopic features of a patterned wafer at extremely high magnification. Applied’s SEM products provide customers with full automation, along with the high accuracy and sensitivity needed for measuring very small CDs. The Applied VeritySEM

®

4i+ metrology system uses proprietary SEM imaging technology to enable precise control of the lithography and etching processes, measuring CDs at a precision of less than 0.3nm. Applied’s OPC Check™ software for the VeritySEM system performs automated qualification of OPC-based (optical proximity correction) chip designs, significantly reducing mask verification time over conventional manual methods.

DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (such as particles, scratches or residues) that are first located by a defect detection system and then classify the defects to identify their source. The high-throughput, fully automatic Applied SEMVision™ Defect Analysis products enable customers to use this technology as an integral part of their production lines to analyze critical defects with industry-leading throughput. In 2013, Applied introduced the latest generation of defect review and classification technology with its Applied SEMVision G6 system, designed to accelerate time-to-yield for leading-edge chip manufacturing at the 1X-nm node and beyond. The system delivers a 30% resolution improvement over the previous SEMVision generation, making it the highest available in the industry.

Wafer Inspection —

Using deep ultraviolet (DUV) laser-based technology, defects can be detected on patterned wafers (wafers with printed circuit images) as they move between processing steps. Defects include particles, open circuit lines, and shorts between lines. The Applied UVision

®

5 wafer inspection system detects yield-limiting defects in the critical patterning layers of logic and memory devices.

Mask Making

Masks are used by photolithography systems to transfer microscopic circuit designs onto wafers. Since an imperfection in a mask may be replicated on the wafer, the mask must be virtually defect-free. Applied provides systems for etching and inspecting masks.

Applied's Tetra™ line of systems has been used by mask makers worldwide to etch the majority of high-end masks over the last five years. The Applied Centura Tetra EUV (extreme ultraviolet) Advanced Reticle Etch system is an advanced etch tool for fabricating leading-edge masks at 22nm and below. The Applied Aera3™ Mask inspection system also addresses the challenges of detecting defects on 22nm masks, using sophisticated aerial imaging technology that allows users to immediately see how the pattern on the mask will appear on the wafer, revealing only the defects most likely to print and significantly reducing inspection time. These systems also address the challenge of fabricating emerging EUV lithography masks.

Applied’s backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Delays in delivery schedules and/or a reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business and results of operations.

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies

Applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembly, test and integration of various proprietary and commercial parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) that are used to manufacture systems. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model under which manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including the United States, Europe, Israel, Singapore, Taiwan, and other countries in Asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. Applied uses numerous vendors, including contract manufacturers, to supply parts and assembly services for the manufacture and support of its products. Although Applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, this is not always possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Applied seeks to reduce costs and to lower the risks of manufacturing and service interruptions by: (1) selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key parts; (2) monitoring the financial condition of key suppliers; (3) maintaining appropriate inventories of key parts; (4) qualifying new parts on a timely basis; and (5) locating certain manufacturing operations in close proximity to suppliers and customers.

Research, Development and Engineering

Applied’s long-term growth strategy requires continued development of new products. The Company’s significant investment in research, development and engineering (RD&E) has generally enabled it to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these products into their manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology selection cycle. Applied works closely with its global customers to design systems and processes that meet their planned technical and production requirements. Product development and engineering organizations are located primarily in the United States, as well as in Europe, Israel, Taiwan, and China. In addition, Applied outsources certain RD&E activities, some of which are performed outside the United States, primarily in India. Process support and customer demonstration laboratories are located in the United States, China, Taiwan, Europe, and Israel.

Applied’s investments in RD&E for product development and engineering programs to create or improve products and technologies over the last three years were as follows:

$1.3 billion

(

18 percent

of net sales) in fiscal


,

$1.2 billion

(

14 percent

of net sales) in fiscal


, and

$1.1 billion

(

11 percent

of net sales) in fiscal


. Applied has spent an average of

14 percent

of net sales in RD&E over the last five years. In addition to RD&E for specific product technologies, Applied maintains ongoing programs for automation control systems, materials research, and environmental control that are applicable to its products.



Marketing and Sales

Net sales by geographic region, determined by the location of customers' facilities to which products were shipped, were as follows:

Because of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied markets and sells products worldwide almost entirely through a direct sales force. Approximately

80 percent

of Applied’s fiscal


net sales were to regions outside of the United States.

General economic conditions impact Applied’s business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may negatively impact sales. Applied’s business is usually not seasonal in nature, but it is highly cyclical, based on capital equipment investment by major semiconductor, flat panel display, solar PV and other manufacturers. Customers’ expenditures depend on many factors, including: anticipated market demand and pricing for semiconductors, display, solar cells and modules, and other substrates; the development of new technologies; customers’ factory utilization; capital resources and financing; government policies and incentives; and global and regional economic conditions.

Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and long-lived assets attributable to Applied’s geographic regions is included in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following companies accounted for at least 10 percent of Applied’s net sales in


,


, and


, which were for products in multiple reportable segments.

Competition

The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Applied’s ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely commercialize its technology, continually improve its products, and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer requirements. Significant competitive factors include technical capability and differentiation, productivity and cost-effectiveness. The importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs, including product mix and respective product requirements, applications, and the timing and circumstances of purchasing decisions. Substantial competition exists in all areas of Applied’s business. Competitors range from small companies that compete in a single region, which may benefit from policies and regulations that favor domestic companies, to global, diversified companies. Applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of investment in RD&E, marketing and sales, and global customer support activities. Management believes that many of Applied’s products have strong competitive positions.



The competitive environment for each segment is described below.

The semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by consumer demand for lower-cost electronic products with increased capability. As a result, products within the Silicon Systems Group segment are subject to significant changes in customer requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, new materials and an increasing number of applications. While certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach. The rapid pace of technological change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies and products and create opportunities for existing and new competitors. Applied offers a variety of technologically differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively. Applied allocates resources among its numerous product offerings and therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products. There are a number of competitors serving the semiconductor manufacturing equipment industry, with some offering a single product line and others offering multiple product lines. These competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to global, diversified companies. The competitive environment for the Silicon Systems Group in fiscal 2013 reflected continued investment in the semiconductor industry driven by capacity demand for mobile computing. Foundry customers led capacity additions for advanced technology nodes and were the primary drivers for net sales of the Silicon Systems Group in fiscal 2013.

Products and services within the Applied Global Services segment complement the Silicon Systems Group, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions segments’ products, in markets that are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of numerous competitors. To compete effectively, Applied offers products and services to improve tool performance, lower overall cost of ownership, and increase the productivity and energy efficiency of customers’ fab operations. Significant competitive factors include productivity, cost-effectiveness, and the level of technical service and support. The importance of these factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type of products or services offered.  Industry conditions that affected Applied Global Services’ sales of spares and services in fiscal 2013 were principally semiconductor manufacturers' wafer starts and factory utilization rates.

Products in the Display segment are generally subject to strong competition from a number of major competitors primarily in Asia. Applied holds established market positions with its technically-differentiated LCD and OLED manufacturing solutions for PECVD, color filter PVD, PVD array, PVD touch panel, and TFT array testing, although its market position could change quickly due to customers' evolving requirements. The competitive environment for the Display segment in fiscal 2013 was characterized by a recovery in demand for TV manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels the prior year, while demand continued for equipment to make touch screen and high-end mobile devices. Important factors affecting the competitive position of Applied's Display products include: industry trends, Applied's ability to innovate and develop new products, and the extent to which Applied's products are technically-differentiated, as well as which customers within a highly concentrated customer base are making capital equipment investments and Applied's existing position at these customers.

Applied's products within the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment compete in several diverse market areas, including primarily the c-Si solar equipment market. The solar equipment market is characterized by significant pressure to reduce customers' overall production costs and improve performance. In fiscal 2013, while solar end-market demand continued to be robust as the industry further reduced manufacturing costs and made conversion efficiency improvements, enabling PV-generated electricity to reach parity with retail electricity rates in an increasing number of areas around the world, investment levels in capital equipment remained depressed. Global solar PV production capacity exceeds end-demand, resulting in a continued challenging environment and causing solar cell and wafering customers to defer purchases of new capacity to preserve capital. The rationalization of capacity will be an important factor in determining when supply and demand come back into balance. Adding to market uncertainty are international trade actions against Chinese solar manufacturers commenced in the U.S. and other regions that have resulted in the imposition of some import sanctions, with others still under consideration. With respect to its c-Si equipment products, Applied competes with a number of other companies, some of which have significant experience with solar applications and some of which are new entrants to the solar equipment market. The solar industry downturn has affected many of Applied's competitors and customers adversely, with some companies going through extensive financial and organizational restructuring, and in some instances ceasing operations.



Patents and Licenses

Management believes that Applied’s competitive position significantly depends upon the Company’s research, development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and not just on its patent position. However, protection of Applied’s technological assets through enforcement of its intellectual property rights, including patents, is important. Therefore, Applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the United States and other countries for inventions that Applied considers significant. Applied has approximately 10,400 patents in the United States and other countries, and additional applications are pending for new inventions. Although Applied does not consider its business materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Applied and the products made and sold under its patents, taken as a whole, are a significant element of Applied’s business. In addition to patents, Applied also possesses other intellectual property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets, and copyrights.

Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements with other companies when management determines that it is in Applied’s best interest to do so. Applied pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use, in several of its products, of certain patented technologies. Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third parties. Royalties received from or paid to third parties have not been, and are not expected to be, material to Applied’s consolidated results of operations.

In the normal course of business, Applied periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In responding to such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful for Applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights will be available to Applied on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If Applied is not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Environmental Matters

Applied maintains a number of environmental, health, and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature. As part of these programs, Applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, Applied has trained personnel to conduct investigations of any environmental, health, or safety incidents, including, but not limited to, spills, releases, or possible contamination.

Compliance with federal, state and local environmental, health, and safety provisions, including, but not limited to, those regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, remedial agreements, and other actions relating to the environment have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on Applied’s capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations.

The most recent report on Applied’s environmental, health, and safety activities can be found in the Company’s latest Citizenship Report on its website at

Employees

At

October 27, 2013

, Applied employed approximately

13,700

regular employees and 800 temporary employees. In the high-technology industry, competition for highly-skilled employees is intense. Applied believes that its future success is highly dependent upon its continued ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees. There can be no assurance that Applied will be able to attract, hire, assimilate, motivate, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees.

Item 1A:

Risk Factors

The following factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and they should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.

The industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to predict.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, and solar industries, Applied is subject to business cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes in customers’ requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology, which depend in part on customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, end-use demand, consumer buying patterns, and inventory levels relative to demand, as well as the rate of technology transitions and general economic conditions. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect Applied’s orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income.

To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple segments, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with the uncertain global economy.

Uncertain global economic conditions and weak or moderate growth in China, Europe, and the United States, along with uncertainties in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, and government austerity measures, are posing challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. The markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer spending, while the solar market depends in part on government incentives and the availability of financing for PV installations. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services, which may in turn reduce Applied's net sales, reduce backlog, and affect Applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for Applied’s products or added costs. In addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.

Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. In addition, Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign exchange, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts.



Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.

The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries in which Applied operates are characterized by ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's products, including:

•

the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on foundry and other customers’ businesses and, in turn, on demand for Applied’s products;

•

increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;

•

differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and solar industries;

•

the increasing importance of establishing, improving and maintaining strong relationships with customers;

•

the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the adoption rate of new manufacturing technology;

•

the need to continually reduce the total cost of manufacturing system ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost consumer electronics compared to business information technology spending;

•

the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;

•

manufacturers’ ability to reconfigure and re-use fabrication systems;

•

the increasing importance of, and difficulties in, developing products with sufficient differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing decisions;

•

requirements for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;

•

price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, displays and solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such products;

•

the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for production;

•

the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied products; and

•

the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the environmental impact and sustainability associated with manufacturing operations.

Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the semiconductor industry.

The largest proportion of Applied’s consolidated net sales and profitability has been and continues to be derived from sales of manufacturing equipment by the Silicon Systems Group to the global semiconductor industry. In addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services is from sales of service products to semiconductor manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's semiconductor equipment and service products, including:

•

the increasing cost of research and development due to many factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip, the use of new materials, new and more complex device structures, more applications and process steps, increasing chip design costs, and the increasing cost and complexity of integrated manufacturing processes;

•

the need to reduce product development time, despite the increasing difficulty of technical challenges;

•

the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;

•

the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in capital equipment;

•

challenges in generating organic growth given semiconductor manufacturers’ levels of capital expenditures  and the allocation of capital investment to market segments that Applied does not serve, such as lithography, or segments where Applied's products have lower relative market presence;

•

the importance of increasing market positions in under-penetrated segments, such as etch and inspection;



•

the growing demand for mobility products, such as tablets and smartphones, and corresponding industry investment in devices that require fewer Applied products to manufacture, such as NAND flash memory, than are needed to make  devices used in other applications, such as DRAM for personal computers;

•

the adoption of cloud-based memory storage particularly for mobility products, and the associated inhibiting effect on NAND bit growth rates;

•

the increasing frequency and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, such as 3-D transistors and advanced interconnects, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;

•

shorter cycle times between order placements by customers (particularly foundries) and product shipment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;

•

competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;

•

shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied's foundry customers;

•

the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; and

•

the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.

Applied must accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, such as the transition to 20nm devices, in order to enable opportunities for gains. In addition, the industry transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers presents opportunities as well as risks and uncertainties, including those related to cost, technical complexity, timing, and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing equipment and services.  Several semiconductor customers have invested in another wafer fabrication equipment supplier to help fund development of 450mm and other new technologies, which may influence the timing of technology transitions, funding allocations or other matters.

Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the flat panel display industry.

The global flat panel display industry historically has experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment investment levels, due in part to the limited number of display manufacturers, the concentrated nature of end-use applications, excess production capacity relative to end-use demand, and panel manufacturer profitability. Industry growth has depended primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs and, more recently, on demand for smartphones and other mobile devices, which demand is highly sensitive to cost and improvements in technologies and features. The display industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied's display products, including:

•

the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China by Chinese display manufacturers and manufacturers from other countries, and the ability of non-Chinese manufacturers to obtain government approvals on a timely basis;

•

the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment;

•

the importance of new types of display technologies, such as low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), organic light-emitting diode (OLED) and metal oxide, and new touch panel films, such as anti-reflective and anti-fingerprint; and

•

uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.



Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry.

Investment levels in capital equipment for the global solar industry have experienced considerable volatility. In recent years, global solar PV production capacity has exceeded end-use demand, causing customers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or to cease operations. The global solar market is characterized by ongoing changes specific to this industry that impact demand for and/or the profitability of Applied’s solar products, including:

•

the need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar PV products to at or below grid parity in more global regions by, among other things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar PVs;

•

the variability and uncertainty of government energy policies and their effect in influencing the rate of growth of the solar PV market, including the availability and amount of incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goals for solar installations on government facilities;

•

the number of solar PV manufacturers and amount of global production capacity for solar PVs, primarily in China;

•

the filing of regulatory unfair trade proceedings against solar PVs from China, where most of Applied’s solar equipment sales are concentrated, which has resulted in the assessment of duties on solar cells and modules imported from China and led to other trade-related conflicts and outcomes;

•

the varying levels of operating and industry experience among solar PV manufacturers and the resulting differences in the nature and extent of customer support services requested from Applied;

•

challenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;

•

the growth of market segments in which Applied does not participate, such as passivation and furnaces;

•

the availability and condition of used solar equipment, which impacts demand for new equipment;

•

complexities associated with government-affiliated entities as customers, for example in China;

•

the financial condition of solar PV customers and their access to affordable financing and capital; and

•

solar panel manufacturing overcapacity, which has led to weak industry operating performance and outlooks, deterioration of the solar equipment market, and a worsening of the financial condition of certain customers.

Applied must continually innovate, commercialize its products, and adapt its business and product offerings to respond to competition and rapid technological changes.

As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment in which innovation is critical, its future success depends on many factors, including the effective commercialization and customer acceptance of its equipment, services and related products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including enhancing its presence in existing markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving its operational performance. The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of products in more collaborative, geographically diverse, open and varied competitive environments have grown more complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may entail higher costs and reduced profits. Applied’s performance may be adversely affected if it does not timely, cost-effectively and successfully:

•

identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;

•

develop new products (including disruptive technologies), improve and/or develop new applications for existing products, and adapt similar products for use by customers in different applications and/or markets with varying technical requirements;

•

differentiate its products from those of competitors and any disruptive technologies, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;

•

maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to different markets, customers and applications;

•

enhance its worldwide operations across all business segments to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;

•

focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers' high value problems and foster strong customer relationships;



•

allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among Applied’s products and between the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products, as most appropriate and effective for future growth;

•

reduce the cost and improve the productivity of capital invested in R&D activities;

•

accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;

•

improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;

•

adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;

•

qualify products for evaluation and, in turn, volume manufacturing with its customers; and

•

implement changes in its design engineering methodology, including those that enable reduction of material costs and cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental impact.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.

Applied’s semiconductor customer base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly concentrated as a result of economic and industry conditions. In fiscal 2013, three semiconductor manufacturers accounted for approximately 65 percent of Silicon Systems Group net sales and two customers accounted for 40 percent of Applied’s consolidated net sales. Applied’s display customer base is also highly concentrated, while concentration within Applied’s solar customer base varies depending on the product line but is increasing due to challenging industry conditions. Applied’s customer base is also geographically-concentrated. See Item 2, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” for tabular presentations of net sales by geographic region.

In addition, certain customers have experienced significant ownership or management changes, consolidated with other manufacturers, outsourced manufacturing activities, or engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other manufacturers. Customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased the influence of key industry participants in technology decisions made by their partners. Also, certain customers are making an increasingly greater percentage of their respective industry’s capital equipment investments. Further, claims or litigation involving key industry participants have resulted and may continue to result in changes in their sourcing strategies and other outcomes. In this environment, contracts or orders from a relatively limited number of manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Applied’s business. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business. As Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied.

Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.

In fiscal 2013, approximately

80 percent

of Applied’s net sales were to customers in regions outside the United States. Moreover, China now represents the largest market for various electronic products, such as TVs, PCs, and smartphones. Certain of Applied’s R&D and manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are also located outside the United States, including in Singapore, Taiwan, China, Korea, Israel, Germany and Italy. Applied is also expanding its business and operations in new countries. The global nature of Applied’s business and operations, combined with the need to continually improve the Company’s operating cost structure, presents challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:

•

varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and demands;

•

political and social attitudes, laws, rules, regulations and policies within countries that favor domestic companies over non-domestic companies, including customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the development and growth of local competitors;

•

customer- or government-supported efforts to influence Applied to conduct more of its operations and sourcing in a particular country, such as Korea and China;

•

variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or international laws and regulations (including intellectual property, labor, tax, and import/export laws), as well as the interpretation and application of such laws and regulations;

•

global trade issues, including those related to the interpretation and application of import and export licenses, as well as international trade disputes;



•

positions taken by governmental agencies regarding possible national commercial and/or security issues posed by international business operations;

•

fluctuating raw material, commodity, energy and shipping costs or shipping delays;

•

challenges associated with managing more geographically diverse operations and projects, which require an effective organizational structure and appropriate business processes, procedures and controls;

•

a more diverse workforce with different experience levels, cultures, customs, business practices and worker expectations;

•

variations in the ability to develop relationships with local customers, suppliers and governments;

•

fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the relative strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar against the Japanese yen, euro, Taiwanese dollar, Israeli shekel or Chinese yuan;

•

the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in different locations around the world;

•

political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms), pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;

•

the need for an effective business continuity plan if a disaster or other event occurs that could disrupt business operations;

•

the need to regularly reassess the size, capability and location of global infrastructure and make appropriate changes;

•

cultural and language differences;

•

difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into new countries;

•

hiring and integration of an increasing number of new workers, including in countries such as India and China;

•

the increasing need for the workforce to be more mobile and work in or travel to different regions;

•

uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries; and

•

uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors, displays and solar PVs in the developing economies of certain countries.

Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, which are experiencing significant growth of customers, suppliers and competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China and Korea present large potential markets for its products and opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower projected levels of profitability and margins for certain products than historically have been achieved in other regions.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.

Applied has made, and in the future may make, acquisitions of or investments in companies, technologies or products in existing, related or new markets for Applied. Business combinations, acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks that vary depending on their scale and nature, including but not limited to:

•

diversion of management’s attention from other operational matters;

•

contractual restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s business during the pendency of a proposed transaction

;

•

inability to complete proposed transactions as anticipated or at all and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;

•

the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns;

•

requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and/or restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;

•

ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;



•

failure to commercialize purchased technologies;

•

initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;

•

inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;

•

failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees;

•

the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;

•

potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;

•

reductions in cash balances and/or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;

•

exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;

•

challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;

•

inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;

•

inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;

•

impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;

•

the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;

•

unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and

•

the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.

Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value and/or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.

The proposed business combination with Tokyo Electron Limited may not be completed or, if completed, the intended benefits may not be fully realized.

On September 24, 2013, Applied entered into an agreement with Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL), a Japanese corporation and global provider of semiconductor, flat panel display and photovoltaic panel production equipment, to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including approval by Applied’s and TEL’s shareholders and regulatory approvals. The proposed business combination is subject to the risk factors described immediately above, including the risks that the combination may not be consummated in a timely manner or at all; that required  regulatory approvals may not be obtained or may be subject to conditions that reduce the estimated benefits of the combination; that the businesses and operations of Applied and TEL may not be integrated successfully; and, following completion of the transaction, that the inability to effectively integrate operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, or other factors, may impact the combined company’s ability to realize anticipated synergies and benefits.

Operating in multiple industries, and the entry into new markets and industries, entail additional challenges and obligations.

As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand into related or new markets and industries, either with its existing products or with new products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. The entry into different markets involves additional challenges, including those arising from:

•

the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;

•

the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;

•

differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;

•

Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;



•

the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;

•

the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;

•

Applied’s ability to rapidly expand or reduce its operations to meet increased or decreased demand, respectively, and the associated effect on working capital;

•

new materials, processes and technologies;

•

the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;

•

new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain and/or limited funding, evolving business models and/or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;

•

new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and/or established customer relationships;

•

entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;

•

third parties’ intellectual property rights; and

•

the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.

In addition, Applied from time to time receives funding from United States and other government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase its research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, Applied may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations.

Manufacturing interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.

Applied’s business depends on its timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from suppliers, including contract manufacturers. Some key parts are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by suppliers located in countries other than the countries where Applied conducts its manufacturing, including China and Korea. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Applied and for companies throughout its supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. Applied may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:

•

the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;

•

volatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;

•

difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;

•

information technology or infrastructure failures; and

•

natural disasters or other events beyond Applied's control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.

If a supplier fails to meet Applied’s requirements concerning quality, cost, socially-responsible business practices, or other performance factors, Applied may transfer its business to alternative sources, which could entail manufacturing delays, additional costs, or other difficulties. In addition, if Applied needs to rapidly increase its business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand or expedited shipment schedules, this may exacerbate any interruptions in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery of parts. If Applied purchases inventory in anticipation of customer demand that does not materialize, or if customers reduce or delay orders, Applied may incur excess inventory charges.



The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.

Applied’s success, competitiveness and ability to execute on its global strategies and maintain a culture of innovation depend in large part on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees, especially in critical positions. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, management changes, Applied’s organizational structure, hiring practices of competitors and other companies, cost reduction activities (including workforce reductions and unpaid shutdowns), availability of career development opportunities, the ability to obtain necessary authorizations for workers to provide services outside their home countries, and the effectiveness of Applied’s compensation and benefit programs, including its share-based programs. Restructuring programs present particular challenges to the extent they involve the departure of knowledgeable and experienced employees and the resulting need to identify and train existing or new workers to perform necessary functions, which may result in unexpected costs, reduced productivity, and/or difficulties with respect to internal processes and controls.

Applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.

Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent  misuse. Applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not adequately protect or assert these rights or obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of Applied’s rights to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to adequately protect Applied’s rights. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied's ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied's intellectual property.

Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.

In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems. This data includes confidential information belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents, ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation, corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied's and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied's investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs.

Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.

Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.

Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may (1) be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; (2) divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; (3) inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; (4) result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and/or (5) negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.



The failure to successfully implement and conduct outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could adversely affect results of operations.

To better align its costs with market conditions, locate closer to customers, enhance productivity, and improve efficiencies, Applied conducts certain engineering, software development, manufacturing, sourcing and other operations in regions outside the United States, including India, Taiwan, China, and Korea. Applied has implemented a distributed manufacturing model, under which certain manufacturing and supply chain activities are conducted in various countries, including the United States, Europe, Israel, Singapore, Taiwan and other countries in Asia, and assembly of some systems is completed at customer sites. In addition, Applied outsources certain functions to third parties, including companies in the United States, India, China, Korea, Malaysia and other countries. Outsourced functions include contract manufacturing, engineering, customer support, software development, information technology support, finance and administrative activities. The expanding role of third party providers has required changes to Applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and managing these providers, as well as redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect the intellectual property of Applied and its customers, suppliers and other partners. If Applied does not accurately forecast the amount, timing and mix of demand for products, or if contract manufacturers or other outsource providers fail to perform in a timely manner or at satisfactory quality levels, Applied’s ability to meet customer requirements could suffer, particularly during a market upturn.

In addition, Applied must regularly implement or update comprehensive programs and processes to better align its global organizations, including initiatives to enhance the Asia supply chain and improve back office and information technology infrastructure for more efficient transaction processing. Applied also is implementing a multi-year, company-wide program to transform certain business processes or extend established processes, including the transition to a single enterprise resource planning (ERP) software system to perform various functions. The implementation of additional functionality to the ERP system entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in business processes that could disrupt Applied’s operations, such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products, project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and aggregate financial and operational data. During transitions Applied must continue to rely on legacy information systems, which may be costly or inefficient, while the implementation of new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may divert management’s attention from other operational activities, negatively affect employee morale, or have other unintended consequences.

If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its outsourcing and relocation strategies, if required export and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if Applied’s third party providers do not perform as anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in enhancing business processes, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs (including energy and transportation), manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the structure and/or operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality issues, reputational harm, increased product time-to-market, and/or inefficient allocation of human resources.

Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.

Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. For example, in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.



Changes in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results of operations.

As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in the: (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; (3) plans of the Company to permanently reinvest certain funds held outside of the U.S.; or (4) valuation of Applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities.

To better align with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. Applied has received authorization to use tax incentives that provide that income earned in certain countries outside the U.S. will be subject to tax holidays or reduced income tax rates. To obtain the benefit of these tax provisions, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these provisions could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met, or if Applied incurs net losses for which it cannot claim a deduction.

In addition, Applied is subject to regular examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time initiates amendments to previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and accruals.

Applied is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and safety regulations.

Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in connection with its global business operations, including but not limited to: regulations related to the development, manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of materials used in its products or in producing its products; the operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental and safety regulations, such as those related to climate change, could result in: (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its products; (4) limitations on the operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property; and/or (5) a decrease in the value of its real property.

Applied is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory environment.

Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and regulations that may be enacted by executive order, legislative bodies and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates; (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and regulations. For example, as a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of multiple jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changes in laws, regulations and standards may create uncertainty regarding compliance matters. Efforts to comply with new and changing regulations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities.

Overview

Applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar photovoltaic (PV) and related industries. Applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, flat panel liquid crystal and other displays, solar PV cells and modules, and other electronic devices. These customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. A summary of financial information for each reportable segment is found in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that could affect Applied’s operations is set forth under “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference. Product development and manufacturing activities occur primarily in North America, Europe and Asia. Applied’s equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily through a direct sales force.

Applied’s results historically have been driven primarily by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic products. Each of Applied’s businesses is subject to highly cyclical industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, solar PVs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and technological advances in fabrication processes. In light of this cyclicality, Applied's results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter. As a result of these conditions and the changing global economic environment, there were significant fluctuations in Applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales within and across the last three fiscal years.

Applied's strategic priorities for fiscal 2014 include growing its presence in wafer fab equipment and display, reducing its losses in the solar business, and expanding its overall available market.  As part of this strategy, the Company has implemented initiatives to decrease overhead spending and further reduce solar operating expense to fund research and development in semiconductor and other key product areas. In semiconductor equipment, Applied intends to continue investment in 300mm, 450mm and other semiconductor technologies to strengthen the product pipeline and investment in the enhancement of technical relationships with customers.

On September 24, 2013, Applied entered into an agreement with Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL), a Japanese corporation and global supplier of semiconductor, flat panel display and photovoltaic panel production equipment, to effect a combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company. The combination is expected to bring together leading technologies and products and create an expanded set of capabilities in precision materials engineering and patterning. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including approval by Applied’s and TEL’s stockholders and regulatory approvals.



Results of Operations

The following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years:

Reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented under "Non-GAAP Adjusted Results" below. Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 each contained 52 weeks.

Mobility continued to be the largest influence on semiconductor industry spending during fiscal 2013. The first half of fiscal 2013 was characterized by strong demand for semiconductor equipment from foundry customers driven by demand for advanced mobile chips. In the second half of the year, demand from foundry customers softened, reflecting seasonal consumer buying patterns for mobility products, while demand from memory and logic customers improved. Mobility also represents a significant driver of display industry spending, and demand for mobile display equipment remained strong during fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2013 was also characterized by a recovery in demand for TV manufacturing equipment compared to weak industry levels in the prior year, resulting from higher consumer demand in emerging markets and for larger LCD TVs. In solar, while end market growth continued, investment in solar equipment remained low during fiscal 2013 due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the industry.

Applied expects the mobility trend to remain the main growth driver for the semiconductor industry, and in turn for the Silicon Systems Group, in 2014. Applied also expects the overall display investment cycle to continue into 2014, while solar equipment demand is expected to remain soft in 2014.

Fiscal 2012 was characterized by significant fluctuations in demand for semiconductor equipment, coupled with an extremely weak market environment for display and solar equipment. Applied completed its acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian) in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Mobility was the greatest influence on semiconductor industry spending in fiscal 2012. Consumer buying patterns for electronic products, combined with growing semiconductor customer concentration, contributed to a seasonality effect, with relatively strong demand for semiconductor equipment led by foundry customers during the first half of fiscal 2012, followed by softening of demand from foundry and logic customers in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 and further declines across all categories of wafer fab equipment customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.  Low investment levels for display equipment continued in fiscal 2012 due to decreased capacity requirements for larger flat panel televisions as conditions in this industry remained challenging. As with the semiconductor industry, demand for mobility products, such as smartphones and tablets, significantly influenced equipment spending in the display industry. In the solar industry, fiscal 2012 was characterized by continued excess manufacturing capacity, which led to significantly reduced demand for crystalline-silicon (c-Si) equipment, as well as weaker operating performance and outlook by the fourth quarter.



The first nine months of fiscal 2011 reflected increased demand across all segments except Display, due to improved global economic and industry conditions, although demand softened for semiconductor, display and solar equipment in the last quarter of fiscal 2011. Towards the end of fiscal 2011, each of the semiconductor, display and solar industries was negatively impacted by uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, and the display and solar equipment industries were also negatively impacted by overcapacity.

New Orders

New orders by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

New orders for fiscal 2013 increased compared to fiscal 2012, primarily due to a recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment and increased demand in semiconductor equipment, partially offset by lower demand for service products, as well as depressed demand for c-Si solar equipment due to continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry.  New orders for the Silicon Systems Group and Applied Global Services continued to comprise a majority of Applied's consolidated total new orders.

New orders for fiscal 2012 decreased for all segments compared to the same periods in the prior year, mostly due to the lower demand for c-Si solar and display equipment due to excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and the continued down cycle in the display industry, respectively, partially offset by the addition of orders attributable to Varian of $1.0 billion. The Silicon Systems Group's and Applied Global Services' relative share of total new orders increased compared to the prior year as a result of the addition of Varian and the sharp decrease in orders in Display and Energy and Environmental Solutions.

New orders by geographic region, determined by the product shipment destination specified by the customer, were as follows:

The recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment in fiscal 2013 led to the increase in new orders from customers in China. The change in the composition of new orders from customers in Taiwan, Korea, Japan and the United States was primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment.

The decrease in new orders from customers in China in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily reflected reduced investments by solar manufacturers due to industry overcapacity.



Changes in backlog during fiscal 2013 and 2012 were as follows:

Backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized; and (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months. Applied’s backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods, due to the potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders.  Approximately 80 percent of the backlog as of the end of fiscal 2013 is anticipated to be shipped within the first two quarters of fiscal 2014.

Applied’s backlog was

$2.4 billion

at

October 27, 2013

compared to

$1.6 billion

at

October 28, 2012

. Backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2013 and totaled

$191 million

, primarily consisting of customer cancellations and financial debookings.

Backlog by reportable segment as of

October 27, 2013

and

October 28, 2012

was as follows:

Backlog increased in fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012 across all segments. The increase in backlog was primarily due to increases in demand from memory customers and the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 approximately 49 percent of net sales in the Silicon Systems Group, Applied’s largest business segment, were for orders received and shipped within the quarter, down from 53 percent in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012.



Net Sales

Net sales by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

For fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012, net sales in Display increased, reflecting the recovery of TV manufacturing equipment investment, while net sales across all other segments decreased.  The decrease primarily reflected continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry and lower investments in semiconductor equipment, spares and services. The Silicon Systems Group remains the largest contributor of net sales.

For fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, net sales in the Silicon Systems Group increased slightly while net sales across all other segments decreased. The decreases reflected lower investments in c-Si solar and LCD TV equipment, partially offset by sales attributable to Varian.

Net sales by geographic region, determined by the location of customers' facilities to which products were shipped, were as follows:

The increase in net sales from customers in China in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to the recovery in demand for display manufacturing equipment. The changes in net sales from customers in Korea, the United States and Taiwan were primarily related to changes in customer demand for semiconductor equipment.

The decrease in net sales from customers in China in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily reflected decreased investments in the solar and display industries due to overcapacity.



Gross Margin

Gross margins for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented under "Non-GAAP Adjusted Results" below.

Gross margin and non-GAAP adjusted gross margin decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 reflecting lower sales. Gross margin percent and non-GAAP adjusted gross margin percent increased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 despite lower sales, due primarily to lower inventory charges, a favorable product mix, and material cost reductions. Gross margin and non-GAAP adjusted gross margin decreased in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 due primarily to changes in segment and customer mix, additional inventory charges, and lower net sales, partially offset by sales for a thin film solar production line in fiscal 2012, for which inventory was fully reserved prior to fiscal 2012. In addition, the decrease in gross margin in fiscal 2012 was also affected by inventory fair value adjustments and intangible asset amortization associated with purchase accounting, mostly associated with the acquisition of Varian, which amounted to $253 million in fiscal 2012. Gross margin and non-GAAP adjusted gross margin during fiscal


,


and


included

$50 million

,

$54 million

and

$48 million

, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.

Research, Development and Engineering

Research, Development and Engineering (RD&E) expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments in RD&E to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets the current and projected requirements of its customers’ most advanced designs. Applied has maintained and intends to continue its commitment to investing in RD&E in order to continue to offer new products and technologies. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of Applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market.



In fiscal 2013, Applied increased its investment in 300mm product development. Applied developed new applications for its epitaxial technology, enabling industry transition to NMOS transistors at the 20nm node and enabling chip makers to build faster devices and deliver next-generation mobile computing power. Applied also released its next-generation defect review and classification technology that delivers industry-leading resolution used for finding, identifying and analyzing defects in 3D FinFET and high aspect ratio structures at 10nm nodes. Applied also continued to invest in the development of 450mm wafer fabrication equipment.

RD&E expenses increased in fiscal 2013 compared to the prior year. As part of its growth strategy, Applied has taken certain actions, including workforce reductions and reprioritization of existing spend, to enable increased funding for investments in technical capabilities and critical R&D programs in current and new markets, with a focus on semiconductor technologies. The increase in RD&E for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily due to RD&E expenses related to Varian of approximately $180 million and continued investment in the development of equipment for smaller linewidths and 450mm wafers, partially offset by lower investments in solar R&D projects and the cessation of light-emitting diode (LED) equipment development. RD&E expense during fiscal


,


and


included

$53 million

,

$54 million

and

$46 million

, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.

Marketing and Selling

Marketing and selling expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

The decrease in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to savings from restructuring programs along with a reduction in the bad debt provision during the year as a result of lower risk exposures in display and solar customers. The increase in marketing and selling expenses for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to marketing and selling expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Varian. Marketing and selling expenses during fiscal


,


and


included

$20 million

,

$22 million

and

$16 million

, respectively, of share-based compensation expense.

General and Administrative

General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

The decrease in G&A for fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 was primarily due to the absence of certain costs incurred during fiscal 2012 associated with the acquisition of Varian, savings from restructuring programs, and lower share-based compensation expense, partially offset by costs incurred associated with the business combination with TEL. The increase in G&A expenses for fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 is primarily attributable to acquisition-related costs and other G&A expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition of Varian, partially offset by lower variable compensation and savings associated with temporary shutdowns. G&A expenses during fiscal


,


and


included

$34 million

,

$52 million

and

$36 million

respectively, of share-based compensation expense.



Impairment of Goodwill

During fiscal 2012, the solar industry faced increasing challenges, including manufacturing overcapacity and weak operating performance and outlook, which led to a deterioration  in market conditions. As a result, Applied performed a two-step goodwill impairment test and recorded a

$421 million

goodwill impairment charge in its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the solar industry experienced further deterioration of market conditions associated with continued manufacturing overcapacity and weaker operating performance and outlook, resulting in increased uncertainties regarding the timing and nature of a recovery in solar capital equipment expenditures. Taking these factors into account, Applied reassessed its financial outlook for the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit and consequently reevaluated the recoverability of this reporting unit's goodwill. Applied performed the two-step impairment test and concluded that the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value. Based on Applied's analyses, the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit. As a result, in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied recorded a goodwill impairment charge of

$224 million

, representing all of the remaining goodwill for this reporting unit. Applied also performed an impairment test for long-lived assets associated with the reporting unit and determined that the majority of intangible assets were impaired mostly due to the lower long-term revenue and profitability outlook associated with products related to these intangible assets. Accordingly, during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied recorded an impairment charge of

$54 million

related to these intangible assets, which was the amount by which the carrying value of these intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair value, based on discounted projected cash flows.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal


, Applied also performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for the remaining reporting units for impairment and determined that it was more likely than not that each of the Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, and Display reporting units' fair values exceeded its respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for these reporting units.

The evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment. In the event of future changes in business conditions, Applied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. If the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at that time.

For further details, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Restructuring and Asset Impairments

Restructuring and asset impairment expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

On October 3, 2012, Applied announced a restructuring plan (the 2012 Global Restructuring Plan) to realign its global workforce and enhance its ability to invest for growth. Under this plan, Applied implemented a voluntary retirement program and other workforce reduction actions that were expected to affect approximately


to

1,300

positions, or

6 percent

to

9 percent

of its global workforce. In connection with the 2012 Global Restructuring Plan, Applied expects to incur aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges comprised of severance and other termination benefits of up to

$160 million

(including costs incurred to date of

$145 million

discussed below). Applied expects to substantially complete this plan by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2014.

During fiscal 2013 and 2012, Applied recognized

$39 million

and

$106 million

, respectively, of employee-related costs in connection with the 2012 Global Restructuring Plan. These costs were not allocated to the segments. Applied has incurred aggregate pre-tax restructuring charges comprised of severance and other termination benefits of

$145 million

under this plan.



On May 10, 2012, Applied announced a plan (the 2012 EES Restructuring Plan) to restructure its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment in light of challenging industry conditions affecting the solar photovoltaic and light-emitting diode (LED) equipment markets. As part of the 2012 EES Restructuring Plan, Applied relocated certain manufacturing, business operations and customer support functions of its precision wafering systems business and ceased LED development activities. This plan impacted approximately


positions globally. As of

October 27, 2013

, principal activities related to this plan were complete. Total costs incurred in implementing this plan were

$87 million

, of which

$13 million

were inventory-related charges.

During fiscal 2013 and 2012, Applied recognized

$26 million

and

$48 million

, respectively, of restructuring and asset impairment charges in connection with the 2012 EES Restructuring Plan. As of

October 27, 2013

, remaining severance accrual associated with restructuring reserves under this program was

$5 million

.

Also in fiscal 2013 and 2012, Applied incurred

$2 million

and

$14 million

, respectively of severance and other employee-related costs in connection with the integration of Varian.

Results for fiscal 2011 included favorable adjustments of $60 million related to restructuring program charges recorded in prior years, offset in part by asset impairment charges of $30 million primarily related to certain intangible assets.

For further details, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Gain on Sale of Facilities, net

In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Applied received $39 million in proceeds from the sale of a property located in North America and incurred a loss of $1 million on the transaction. In the third quarter of fiscal 2011, Applied received $60 million in proceeds from the sale of another property located in North America and incurred a gain of $28 million on the transaction.

Impairments of Strategic Investments

Equity investments in privately-held companies are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. If Applied determines that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the investment will be written down to its estimated fair value based on available information, such as pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available market data. During fiscal


,


and


, Applied determined that certain of its equity investments held in privately-held companies were other-than-temporarily impaired and, accordingly, recognized impairment charges of

$6 million

,

$17 million

and

$3 million

, respectively.

Interest Expense and Interest and Other Income, net

Interest expense and interest and other income, net for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in June 2011 to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition of Varian. Interest expense remained flat during fiscal 2013 from the prior year, while interest expense increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 mainly due to the full year of interest expense incurred on the senior unsecured notes in fiscal 2012.

Interest income primarily includes interest earned on cash and investments and realized gains on sale of securities. Interest and other income was essentially flat for fiscal 2013 from fiscal 2012. The decrease in interest income in fiscal 2012 from fiscal 2011 is due to lower cash and investment balances after completion of the acquisition of Varian, decreased realized gains on investment securities, and lower interest rates.



Income Taxes

Income tax expenses for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was significantly lower than the rate for fiscal 2012 due primarily to the geographic composition of Applied's pre-tax income, lower nondeductible goodwill impairment charges, and reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit retroactive to its expiration in December 2012.  These reductions were partially offset by a lower benefit in fiscal 2013 from the U.S. federal domestic production deduction, which was limited by U.S. federal taxable income.

The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was significantly higher than the rate for fiscal 2011 due primarily to   nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2012 and the fiscal 2011 benefit from the December 2010 reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to its expiration in December 2009.

Segment Information

Applied reports financial results in four segments: Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. A description of the products and services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include costs for share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resources, and RD&E functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. In addition, Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment.

The results for each reportable segment are discussed below.

Silicon Systems Group Segment

The Silicon Systems Group segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for deposition, etch, ion implantation, rapid thermal processing, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, and wafer packaging. Development efforts are focused on solving customers' key technical challenges in transistor, patterning, interconnect and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes. The mobility trend remains the largest influence on industry spending, as it drives device manufacturers to deliver high-performance, low-power processors and affordable solid-state storage in a small form factor.

With the acquisition of Varian, Applied acquired ion implantation technology for semiconductor as well as c-Si solar cell manufacturing, which was recorded under the Silicon Systems Group segment in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, Applied began marketing the solar implant products commercially through its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. Accordingly, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied accounts for its solar implant products under the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. The effect of the solar implant products was not material to the operations of either the Silicon Systems Group or Energy and Environmental Solutions segments.



Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented under "Non-GAAP Adjusted Results" below.

New orders for the Silicon Systems Group by end use application for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

The following region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Silicon Systems Group segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years:

Customers in Taiwan accounted for 45 percent, 32 percent and 24 percent of the total net sales of the Silicon Systems Group in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Customers in Korea and United States together contributed 31 percent, 49 percent and 43 percent of the total net sales for this segment in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

The increase in new orders in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012 primarily reflected increased demand from memory customers. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, new orders were

$1.4 billion

, an increase of

16 percent

compared to the prior quarter. Net sales decreased in fiscal 2013 from the prior year due to overall decreased wafer fab equipment spending in the semiconductor industry. Three customers accounted for approximately 65 percent of new orders and net sales in this segment in fiscal 2013. Approximately 49 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were for orders received and shipped within the quarter, which increased from 45 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2013. Operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income for fiscal 2013 decreased compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting the decrease in net sales, changes in product mix and higher RD&E spend.



Fiscal 2012 financial results reflected continued uncertain global economic conditions that led to decreased demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment compared to fiscal 2011, particularly in the second half of fiscal 2012. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, new orders were $741 million, a decrease of 36 percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2012. The decrease in new orders in fiscal 2012 from the prior year was primarily due to reduced demand from memory and logic customers, partially offset by the addition of Varian. Net sales increased slightly in fiscal 2012 from the prior year due to the addition of net sales attributable to Varian, partially offset by decreased investment from memory and logic customers. Three customers accounted for 60 percent of net sales in this segment in fiscal 2012. Approximately 53 percent of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 were for orders received and shipped within the quarter, which remained flat from the third quarter of fiscal 2012. Operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income for fiscal 2012 decreased compared to fiscal 2011, due to changes in customer and product mix with the inclusion of Varian, costs associated with Varian operations, and additional inventory charges. Operating income for fiscal 2012 also included Varian acquisition-related costs of $290 million.

Applied Global Services Segment

The Applied Global Services segment encompasses spares, upgrades, services, remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar manufacturing. These products are designed to improve customers' operating efficiency, optimize their operating costs, and lessen the environmental impact of their factories. Customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented under "Non-GAAP Adjusted Results" below.

There were no individual regions that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Applied Global Services segment for any of the past three fiscal years.

For fiscal 2013, new orders and net sales decreased compared to fiscal 2012 due primarily to lower demand and investments for semiconductor spares and services. In addition, the decrease in net sales was also due to lower investments in display upgrades. Fiscal 2012 net sales also included $85 million in sales for a thin film solar production line. Operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income decreased in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting lower sales and a $20 million customs duty assessment, partially offset by lower operating expenses from spending controls.



For fiscal 2012, new orders and net sales decreased compared to fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower sales of 200mm systems, offset in part by the addition of Varian. Operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income increased in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011 primarily due to the sale of the thin film solar line, for which inventory had been fully reserved prior to fiscal 2012, partially offset by inventory charges of approximately $57 million. Operating income also included restructuring and asset impairment charges of $15 million associated with the 2012 EES Restructuring Plan and the integration of Varian.

Display Segment

The Display segment encompasses products for manufacturing LCDs, OLEDs, and other display technologies for TVs, personal computers (PCs), tablets, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices. The segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing larger-scale TVs; entry into new markets such as the LTPS, metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that enable cost reductions through productivity and uniformity. Display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced LCD TVs and high resolution displays for next generation mobile devices.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented under "Non-GAAP Adjusted Results" below.

The following regions accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Display segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years:

In fiscal 2013, customers in China accounted for 48 percent of total net sales for the Display segment compared to 28 percent in fiscal 2012, and 47 percent in fiscal 2011. Customers in Korea accounted for 33 percent of total net sales for the Display segment in fiscal 2013 compared to 19 percent in fiscal 2012, and 16 percent in fiscal 2011. Customers in Taiwan accounted for 9 percent of total net sales for the segment in fiscal 2013 compared to 38 percent in fiscal 2012, and 31 percent in fiscal 2011. The increase in net sales from customers in China and Korea reflected the recovery in demand for TV manufacturing equipment, while the decrease in net sales from customers in Taiwan primarily related to lower sales of mobile display manufacturing equipment.



Fiscal 2013 operating results reflected a recovery in demand for TV manufacturing equipment and continued demand for advanced mobile display equipment, which resulted in increased new orders, net sales, operating income and non-GAAP adjusted operating income compared to fiscal 2012. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, new orders were

$114 million

, down

55 percent

from the prior quarter, and reflected customer push-outs of orders. Net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 were

$163 million

, almost flat compared to the prior quarter. Two customers accounted for approximately 50 percent of net sales for the Display segment in fiscal 2013.

Fiscal 2012 operating results reflected a continued overcapacity in the large substrate LCD TV equipment industry that resulted in decreased new orders and net sales in fiscal 2012. The downturn in the LCD TV equipment industry was partially offset by increased demand for advanced mobile display equipment. Four customers accounted for 60 percent of net sales for the Display segment in fiscal 2012.

Energy and Environmental Solutions Segment

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products for fabricating c-Si solar PVs, as well as high throughput roll-to-roll deposition equipment for flexible electronics, packaging and other applications. This business is focused on delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy, with an emphasis on lowering the cost to produce solar power and increasing conversion efficiency. While end-demand for solar PVs has been robust over the last several years, investment levels in capital equipment remain depressed. Global solar PV production capacity exceeds anticipated demand, which has caused solar PV manufacturers to significantly reduce or delay investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, or in some instances to cease operations.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years were as follows:

Reconciliations of non-GAAP adjusted measures are presented under "Non-GAAP Adjusted Results" below.



The following region accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment for one or more of the past three fiscal years:

In fiscal 2013, customers in China accounted for 58 percent of total net sales for the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment compared to 49 percent in fiscal 2012, and 80 percent in fiscal 2011.

Fiscal 2013 financial results continued to reflect excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry, which resulted in low levels of new orders and net sales, and consequently an operating loss for the segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, new orders were

$40 million

, up from

$19 million

in the prior quarter and net sales were

$44 million

, almost flat from the prior quarter. Operating loss for fiscal 2013 included restructuring and asset impairment charges of

$25 million

associated with the 2012 EES Restructuring Plan discussed above. Details on restructuring and asset impairment charges are also included in Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Operating loss for fiscal 2013 also included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $278 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied performed the two-step impairment test and concluded that the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value and therefore recorded a goodwill impairment charge of

$224 million

, representing all of the remaining goodwill for this reporting unit. Applied also performed an impairment test for long-lived assets associated with the reporting unit and determined that the majority of intangible assets were impaired. Accordingly, during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied recorded an impairment charge of

$54 million

related to these intangible assets. See discussion in the Impairment of Goodwill section above and Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.

Fiscal 2012 financial results reflected continued excess manufacturing capacity in the solar industry, the impairment of a portion of the segment's goodwill and a restructuring program. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, new orders were $65 million, an increase of 86 percent compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2012's low level of $35 million in new orders. During fiscal 2012, 65 percent of the segment's net sales were from products shipped in earlier periods than fiscal 2012. For fiscal 2012, new orders and net sales decreased compared to fiscal 2011 reflecting significantly decreased demand for c-Si equipment.  The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment reported an operating loss of $668 million for fiscal 2012 compared to an operating income of $453 million for fiscal 2011 due primarily to lower sales, additional inventory charges, impairment and restructuring charges during the year. Restructuring and asset impairment charges of

$38 million

and a goodwill impairment charge of $421 million were recorded in fiscal 2012.



Business Combinations

Tokyo Electron Limited

On September 24, 2013, Applied and TEL entered into a definitive agreement to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company through a “merger of equals.” TEL, a Japanese corporation, is a global provider of semiconductor, flat panel display and photovoltaic panel production equipment. Under the terms of the agreement, TEL shareholders will receive 3.25 shares of the new combined company for every TEL share held. Applied stockholders will receive one share of the new combined company for every Applied share held. Based on the number of shares of Applied common stock and shares of TEL common stock expected to be issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the transaction, it is anticipated that, immediately following the transaction, former Applied stockholders and former TEL shareholders will own approximately 68% and 32%, respectively, of the new combined company.

The new combined company will have a new name, dual headquarters in Tokyo and Santa Clara, and a dual listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and  NASDAQ, and will be incorporated in the Netherlands. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including approval by Applied’s and TEL’s shareholders and regulatory approvals. It is expected that the combined company will commence a $3.0 billion stock repurchase program targeted to be executed within 12 months following the closing of the transaction.

The business combination agreement contains mutual pre-closing covenants, including the obligation of Applied and TEL to conduct their businesses in the ordinary course consistent in all material respects with past practices. The agreement also contains termination rights for Applied and TEL and provides that upon certain events, such as a termination due to a change in recommendation by the other party or a termination relating to certain tax rulings, a termination fee of $400 million is payable.

Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc.

On

November 10, 2011

, Applied completed the acquisition of Varian, a public company manufacturer of semiconductor processing equipment and the leading supplier of ion implantation equipment used by chip makers globally, for an aggregate purchase price of

$4.2 billion

in cash, net of cash acquired and assumed earned equity awards of

$27 million

, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of

May 3, 2011

. Applied's primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for future growth. The acquired business is primarily included in results for the Silicon Systems Group and Applied Global Services segments.

Applied funded the transaction with a combination of existing cash balances and debt. On June 8, 2011, Applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion and used the net proceeds of the Notes to fund a portion of the consideration and certain costs associated with the acquisition. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of long-term debt.

For further details, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance that will require an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, with certain exceptions. The authoritative guidance becomes effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is not expected to have an impact on Applied's financial position or results of operations.

In February 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will require a public entity to present in its annual and interim financial statements information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. The authoritative guidance becomes effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, with early adoption permitted, and is not expected to have an impact on Applied's financial position or results of operations.



Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Applied’s cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased to

$2.9 billion

at

October 27, 2013

from

$3.0 billion

at

October 28, 2012

.

Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:

Sources and Uses of Cash

A summary of cash provided by (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities is as follows:

Operating Activities

Cash from operating activities for fiscal 2013 was

$623 million

, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. Non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation, impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, restructuring and asset impairments and deferred income taxes. The decrease in cash from operating activities from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013 was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventory balances. The increase in accounts receivable resulted from a higher proportion of shipments near the end of the year, while inventories grew to support projected customer demand.

Applied did not utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers in fiscal 2013 and 2012. Applied utilized programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers of

$211 million

in fiscal 2011. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. There was no factoring of accounts receivable or discounting of promissory notes in fiscal 2013. Applied factored accounts receivable and discounted promissory notes of

$93 million

in fiscal 2012, and

$80 million

in fiscal 2011.

Applied’s working capital was

$3.2 billion

at

October 27, 2013

and

$2.8 billion

at

October 28, 2012

. During fiscal 2011, Applied received a U.S. federal income tax refund of $276 million including interest.

Days sales, inventory and payable outstanding at the end of each of the periods indicated are:

Days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and the payment terms. The days sales outstanding in fiscal 2012 included a favorable impact from the timing of the sale of thin film production line during the year. Days inventory outstanding decreased slightly from fiscal 2012 to fiscal 2013, while days payable outstanding increased. The increase in days payable outstanding primarily reflected an increase in accounts payable due to increase in inventory purchases near the end of the period to support projected customer demand.



Investing Activities

Applied generated

$215 million

of cash from investing activities in fiscal 2013 and

$707 million

in fiscal 2011. Applied used

$4.7 billion

of cash for investing activities in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures were

$197 million

in fiscal


,

$162 million

in fiscal


, and

$209 million

in fiscal


. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 were primarily for demonstration and test equipment as well as laboratory tools and equipment upgrades in North America. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 were primarily for various information technology expenditures in North America, including the addition of Varian, and expansion of semiconductor assembly centers in Singapore. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2011 were offset by $99 million in proceeds received from the sale of two properties located in North America and $31 million in proceeds received from the completed divestiture of certain assets held for sale. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled

$406 million

for fiscal


and

$786 million

in fiscal 2011, while purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, totaled

$308 million

for fiscal 2012. Investing activities also included investments in technology and acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market opportunities or emerging technologies. In fiscal 2012, Applied acquired Varian for

$4.2 billion

, net of cash acquired.

Applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.

Financing Activities

Applied used cash for financing activities in the amount of

$519 million

for fiscal 2013 and

$1.8 billion

for fiscal 2012. Applied generated

$960 million

of cash from financing activities in fiscal 2011, consisting primarily of net proceeds received from the issuance of senior unsecured notes of $1.75 billion. Financing activities for these periods included payment of cash dividends to stockholders and issuances and repurchases of common stock. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled

$245 million

in fiscal


,

$1.4 billion

in fiscal


, and

$468 million

in fiscal


. In March 2012, Applied’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing up to $3.0 billion in repurchases over the next three years ending in March 2015. Proceeds from stock issuances related to equity compensation awards were

$182 million

in fiscal


,

$97 million

in fiscal


, and

$95 million

in fiscal


.

During fiscal


, Applied’s Board of Directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of

$0.10

per share each and one quarterly cash dividend of

$0.09

per share. During fiscal


, Applied’s Board of Directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of

$0.09

per share each and one quarterly cash dividend of

$0.08

per share. During fiscal


, Applied’s Board of Directors declared three quarterly cash dividends of

$0.08

per share each and one quarterly cash dividend of

$0.07

. Cash paid in dividends during fiscal


,


and


amounted to

$456 million

,

$434 million

and

$397 million

, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applied’s stockholders.

Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to

$1.6 billion

, of which

$1.5 billion

is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that was extended by

one

year in May 2013 and is scheduled to expire in

May 2017

. This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance at

October 27, 2013

. Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately

$82 million

are with Japanese banks. Applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen.

No

amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities at both

October 27, 2013

and

October 28, 2012

and Applied has not utilized these credit facilities.

In fiscal 2011, Applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. At

October 27, 2013

and

October 28, 2012

, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding.



In June 2011, Applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.75 billion. The following table summarizes the notes issued in June 2011:

The indenture governing the notes includes certain covenants with which Applied was in compliance at

October 27, 2013

. See Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of long-term debt.

Others

During fiscal 2013, Applied did not record any additional bad debt provision but reversed

$13 million

of its allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of lower risk exposures in display and solar customers. While Applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts at

October 27, 2013

is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.

As of

October 27, 2013

, approximately $1.2 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries may be subject to U.S. taxes if repatriated for U.S. operations. Of this amount, Applied intends to permanently reinvest approximately $800 million of these funds outside of the U.S. and does not plan to repatriate these funds. For the remaining cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries, U.S. taxes have been provided for in the financial statements.

Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding Applied’s operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report.

For details on standby letters of credit and other agreements with banks, see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of

October 27, 2013

, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately

$41 million

. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.

Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of

October 27, 2013

, Applied Materials Inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately

$102 million

to cover these arrangements.

Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total rent expense was

$36 million

for fiscal


,

$38 million

for fiscal


, and

$44 million

for fiscal


.



Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes Applied’s contractual obligations as of

October 27, 2013

:

______________________


Represents Applied’s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of Applied’s (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods.


Other long-term liabilities do not include noncurrent income taxes payable, noncurrent deferred income taxes payable and certain tax-related liabilities due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments.

In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, Applied has certain tax obligations. Gross interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been reported as non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of

October 27, 2013

, the gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was

$194 million

. Increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest and penalties accrued related to uncertain tax positions were

$7 million

as of

October 27, 2013

and

$7 million

as of

October 28, 2012

, which were classified as a noncurrent liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At this time, Applied is unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not included in the above contractual obligation table.



Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.

A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of Applied’s consolidated financial statements and that requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on Applied’s financial condition or results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the following attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on Applied’s financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applied’s operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties include those discussed in Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that Applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation of Applied’s financial condition and results of operations.

Management believes that the following are critical accounting policies and estimates:

Revenue Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. Each sale arrangement may contain commercial terms that differ from other arrangements. In addition, Applied frequently enters into contracts that contain multiple deliverables. Judgment is required to properly identify the accounting units of the multiple deliverable transactions and to determine the manner in which revenue should be allocated among the accounting units. Moreover, judgment is used in interpreting the commercial terms and determining when all criteria of revenue recognition have been met in order for revenue recognition to occur in the appropriate accounting period. While changes in the allocation of the estimated sales price between the units of accounting will not affect the amount of total revenue recognized for a particular sales arrangement, any material changes in these allocations could impact the timing of revenue recognition, which could have a material effect on Applied’s financial condition and results of operations.

Warranty Costs

Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.



Inventory Valuation

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and the market approach taking into account such factors as future anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital. Management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. A severe decline in market conditions could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Income Taxes

The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region, nondeductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective tax rate as required. If actual results differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryovers. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has determined that it is more likely than not that Applied’s future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets, net of existing valuation allowance.

The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applied’s expectations could have a material impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.

Non-GAAP Adjusted Results

Management uses non-GAAP adjusted results to evaluate operating and financial performance in light of business objectives and for planning purposes. Applied believes these measures enhance investors’ ability to review the Company’s business from the same perspective as management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods. The non-GAAP adjusted results presented below exclude the impact of the following, where applicable: certain acquisition-related costs; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, goodwill, or investments; gain or loss on sale of facilities; and certain tax items. These non-GAAP adjusted measures are not in accordance with GAAP and may differ from non-GAAP methods of accounting and reporting used by other companies. The presentation of this additional information should not be considered a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Item 7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances. Applied’s investment portfolio includes fixed-income securities with a fair value of approximately

$1.0 billion

at

October 27, 2013

. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on Applied’s investment portfolio at

October 27, 2013

, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately $18 million. While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other-than-temporary. At

October 27, 2013

, the carrying amount of debt issued by Applied was

$1.9 billion

with an estimated fair value of

$2.1 billion

. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of Applied’s debt issuances of approximately $170 million at

October 27, 2013

.

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel, Taiwanese dollar and Swiss franc. Applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 24 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

In certain cases, Applied uses derivatives to hedge specific foreign currency exposures. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, as part of an overall risk management strategy, Applied purchased foreign exchange option contracts to limit its foreign exchange risk associated with the announced business combination with TEL in the event there is a significant weakening in the Japanese yen as compared to the U.S. dollar. The derivatives used to hedge the currency exposure did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. At October 27, 2013, the fair value of the foreign exchange currency option contracts was approximately

$17 million

. Applied recognized a loss of

$7 million

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to such contracts. Changes in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen would impact Applied's consolidated financial statements.  The future maximum loss exposure on this option contract is generally limited to its fair value as of the most recent balance sheet date. For further details, see Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Item 9A:

Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, management of Applied conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report in ensuring that information required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Applied in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Applied’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management of Applied conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of Applied’s internal control over financial reporting based upon the framework in “Internal Control — Integrated Framework (1992)” issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, Applied’s management concluded that Applied’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of

October 27, 2013

.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K and, as part of the audit, has issued a report, included herein, on the effectiveness of Applied’s internal control over financial reporting as of

October 27, 2013

.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Applied’s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal Control over Financial Reporting

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.

Includes only options, restricted stock units performance shares and performance units outstanding under Applied’s equity compensation plans, as no stock warrants or other rights were outstanding as of

October 27, 2013

.

(2)

The weighted average exercise price calculation does not take into account any restricted stock units, and performance shares or performance units as they have a de minimis purchase price.

(3)

Includes 27 million shares of Applied common stock available for future issuance under the Applied Materials, Inc. Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan. Of these 27 million shares, 2 million are subject to purchase during the purchase period in effect as of

October 27, 2013

.

(4)

Includes options to purchase 2 million shares of Applied common stock assumed through various mergers and acquisitions, after giving effect to the applicable exchange ratios. The assumed options had a weighted average exercise price of $6.63 per share. No further shares are available for issuance under the plans under which these assumed awards were granted.

(5)

Includes 14 million shares of Applied common stock available for future issuance under the Applied Materials, Inc. Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees. Of these 14 million shares, 1 million are subject to purchase during the purchase period in effect as of

October 27, 2013

.

Applied has the following equity compensation plans that have not been approved by stockholders:

2000 Global Equity Incentive Plan.

The 2000 Global Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan) was adopted effective as of June 21, 2000. The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified stock options to employees other than officers and directors. The administrator of the 2000 Plan (either the Board of Directors of Applied or a committee appointed by the Board) determines the terms and conditions of all stock options granted; provided, however, that (1) the exercise price generally may not be less than 100 percent of the fair market value (on the date of grant) of the stock covered by the option, and (2) the term of options can be no longer than 10 years (or 13 years in the event of death). Upon stockholder approval of the amended and restated Employee Stock Incentive Plan on March 6, 2012, the 2000 Global Equity Incentive Plan, which had approximately 76 million shares available for issuance, became unavailable for any future grants.

Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees.

The Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees (the Offshore ESPP) was adopted effective as of October 16, 1995 for the benefit of employees of Applied’s participating affiliates (other than United States citizens or residents). The Offshore ESPP provides for the grant of options to purchase shares of Applied common stock through payroll deductions pursuant to one or more offerings. The administrator of the Offshore ESPP (the Board of Directors of Applied or a committee appointed by the Board) determines the terms and conditions of all options prior to the start of an offering, including the purchase price of shares, the number of shares covered by the option and when the option may be exercised. All options granted as part of an offering must be granted on the same date.  As of

October 27, 2013

, a total of 36 million shares have been authorized for issuance under the Offshore ESPP, and 14 million shares remain available for issuance.

Applied Materials Profit Sharing Scheme.

The Applied Materials Profit Sharing Scheme was adopted effective July 3, 1996 to enable employees of Applied Materials Ireland Limited and its participating subsidiaries to purchase Applied common stock at 100% of fair market value on the purchase date. Under this plan, eligible employees may elect to forego a certain portion of their base salary and certain bonuses they have earned and that otherwise would be payable in cash to purchase shares of Applied common stock at full fair market value. Since the eligible employees pay full fair market value for the shares, there is no reserved amount of shares under this plan and, accordingly, the table above does not include any set number of shares available for future issuance under the plan.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of October 27, 2013 and October 28, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended October 27, 2013. These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 27, 2013 and October 28, 2012, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three‑year period ended October 27, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Applied Materials, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 27, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated December 4, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited Applied Materials, Inc.’s (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of October 27, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Applied Materials, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 27, 2013, based on criteria established in

Internal Control - Integrated Framework (1992)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries as of October 27, 2013 and October 28, 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended October 27, 2013. Our report dated December 4, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

Note 1

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Applied Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied or the Company) after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. All references to a fiscal year apply to Applied’s fiscal year which ends on the last Sunday in October. Fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 contained 52 weeks each. Each fiscal quarter of 2013, 2012 and 2011 contained 13 weeks.

In November 2011, Applied completed its acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc. (Varian). Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the acquired business is included in Applied's consolidated results of operations and the results of the Silicon Systems Group and Applied Global Services segments.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, Applied evaluates its estimates, including those related to accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, inventories, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of share-based awards, and income taxes, among others. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

Cash Equivalents

All highly-liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consist primarily of investments in institutional money market funds.

Investments

All of Applied’s investments, except equity investments held in privately-held companies, are classified as available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates. Investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an investment is presented as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The specific identification method is used to determine the gains and losses on investments. Interest earned on cash and investments, as well as realized gains and losses on sale of securities, are included in  interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Equity investments in privately-held companies are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Applied adjusts inventory carrying value for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Applied fully reserves for inventories and noncancelable purchase orders for inventory deemed obsolete. Applied performs periodic reviews of inventory items to identify excess inventories on hand by comparing on-hand balances to anticipated usage using recent historical activity as well as anticipated or forecasted demand. If estimates of customer demand diminish further or market conditions become less favorable than those projected by Applied, additional inventory adjustments may be required.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes are as follows: buildings and improvements,


to


years; demonstration and manufacturing equipment,


to


years; software,


to


years; and furniture, fixtures and other equipment,


to


years. Land improvements are amortized over the shorter of


years or the estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of

five

years or the lease term.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Purchased technology and other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of


to


years using the straight-line method.

Long-Lived Assets

Applied reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these assets for impairment based on estimated future cash flows from these assets.

Research, Development and Engineering Costs

Research, development and engineering costs are expensed as incurred.

Sales and Value Added Taxes

Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Warranty

Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied's warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applied's estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense is based on pretax earnings. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.

Restructuring

From time to time, Applied initiates restructuring activities to appropriately align its cost structure relative to prevailing economic and industry conditions and associated customer demand as well as in connection with certain acquisitions. Costs associated with restructuring actions can include termination benefits and related charges in addition to facility closure, contract termination and other related activities. Costs associated with restructuring activities are included in restructuring charges and asset impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Revenue Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; seller’s price to buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is probable. Applied’s shipping terms are customarily FOB Applied shipping point or equivalent terms. Applied’s revenue recognition policy generally results in revenue recognition at the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon shipment or delivery, Applied recognizes revenue upon passage of title for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions where legal title does not pass at shipment or delivery, revenue is recognized when legal title passes to the customer, which is generally at customer technical acceptance; and (4) for arrangements containing multiple elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is deferred using the relative selling price method utilizing estimated sales prices until delivery of the deferred elements. Applied limits the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations or subject to customer-specified return or adjustment. In cases where Applied has sold products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment, Applied believes that at the time of delivery, it has an enforceable claim to amounts recognized as revenue. Spare parts revenue is generally recognized upon shipment, and services revenue is generally recognized over the period that the services are provided.

When a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, such as hardware and services and/or software products, Applied allocates revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price (ESP) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. Applied generally utilizes the ESP due to the nature of its products. In multiple element arrangements where more-than-incidental software deliverables are included, revenue is allocated to each separate unit of accounting for each of the non-software deliverables and to the software deliverables as a group using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy. If the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable, the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is then allocated to each software deliverable using the guidance for recognizing software revenue.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Applied uses financial instruments, such as forward exchange and currency option contracts, to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions typically expected to occur within 24 months. The terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged. The purpose of Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. All of Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions, the effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders’ equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded promptly in earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or loss on these hedges is recorded promptly in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currencies

As of

October 27, 2013

, primarily all of Applied’s subsidiaries use the United States dollar as their functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are remeasured using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, except for non-monetary assets, such as inventories and property, plant and equipment, which are remeasured using historical exchange rates. Foreign currency-denominated revenues and costs are remeasured using average exchange rates for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are remeasured using historical exchange rates. The resulting remeasurement gains and losses are included in general and administrative expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject Applied to significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities. Applied invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as, but not limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate and municipal bonds, United States Treasury and agency securities, and asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial issuer. Applied performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and generally requires no collateral to secure accounts receivable. Applied maintains an allowance reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on its assessment of the collectability of accounts receivable. Applied regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. In addition, Applied utilizes letters of credit to mitigate credit risk when considered appropriate. Applied is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations. In some instances, Applied has entered into security arrangements which require the counterparties to post collateral to further mitigate credit exposure.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In July 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance that will require an unrecognized tax benefit to be presented as a reduction of a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss or a tax credit carryforward, with certain exceptions. The authoritative guidance becomes effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, with early adoption permitted. The guidance is not expected to have an impact on Applied's financial position or results of operations.

In February 2013, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that will require a public entity to present in its annual and interim financial statements information about reclassification adjustments from accumulated other comprehensive income in a single note or on the face of the financial statements. The authoritative guidance becomes effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2014, with early adoption permitted, and is not expected to have an impact on Applied's financial position or results of operations.

Note 2

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares (representing the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plans shares) outstanding during the period. Applied’s net income has not been adjusted for any period presented for purposes of computing basic or diluted earnings per share due to the Company’s non-complex capital structure.

Potentially dilutive securities attributable to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the combined exercise price, average unamortized fair value and assumed tax benefits upon the exercise of options and the vesting of restricted stock units were greater than the average market price of Applied common stock, and therefore their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

Gains and Losses on Investments

Gross realized gains and losses on sales of investments during fiscal


,


, and


were as follows:

At

October 27, 2013

, gross unrealized losses related to Applied's investment portfolio were not material. Applied regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in determining whether an unrealized loss was considered to be temporary, or other-than-temporary and therefore impaired, include: the length of time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost basis; the financial condition, credit quality and near-term prospects of the investee; and whether it is more likely than not that Applied will be required to sell the security prior to recovery. Generally, the contractual terms of investments in marketable securities do not permit settlement at prices less than the amortized cost of the investments. Applied determined that the gross unrealized losses on its marketable securities at

October 27, 2013

,

October 28, 2012

and

October 30, 2011

were temporary in nature and therefore it did not recognize any impairment of its marketable securities for fiscal


,


or


.  During fiscal


,


and


, Applied determined that certain of its equity investments held in privately-held companies were other-than-temporarily impaired and, accordingly, recognized impairment charges of

$6 million

,

$17 million

and

$3 million

, respectively.

Unrealized gains and temporary losses on investments classified as available-for-sale are included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any related tax effect. Upon realization, those amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to results of operations.

Note 4

Fair Value Measurements

Applied’s financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity investments held in privately-held companies. These equity investments are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when events or circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. Applied’s nonfinancial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred.

Fair Value Hierarchy

Applied uses the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to the fair value measurement:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

•

Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Applied’s investments are comprised primarily of debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at their fair values. In determining the fair value of investments, Applied uses pricing information from pricing services that value securities based on quoted market prices and models that utilize observable market inputs. In the event a fair value estimate is unavailable from a pricing service, Applied generally obtains non-binding price quotes from brokers. Applied then reviews the information provided by the pricing services or brokers to determine the fair value of its short-term and long-term investments. In addition, to validate pricing information obtained from pricing services, Applied periodically performs supplemental analysis on a sample of securities. Applied reviews any significant unanticipated differences identified through this analysis to determine the appropriate fair value.

Investments with remaining effective maturities of


months or less from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining effective maturities of more than


months from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments. As of

October 27, 2013

, substantially all of Applied’s available-for-sale, short-term and long-term investments were recognized at fair value that was determined based upon observable inputs.

:

There were

no

transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during fiscal

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis

Equity investments in privately-held companies are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. If Applied determines that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the investment will be written down to its estimated fair value based on available information, such as pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available market data. Equity investments in privately-held companies totaled

$76 million

at

October 27, 2013

, of which

$66 million

of investments were accounted for under the cost method of accounting and

$10 million

of investments had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements due to an other-than-temporary decline in value. Equity investments in privately-held companies totaled

$70 million

at

October 28, 2012

, of which

$57 million

of investments were accounted for under the cost method of accounting and

$13 million

of investments had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements due to an other-than-temporary decline in value.

During fiscal


,


and


, Applied determined that certain of its equity investments held in privately-held companies were other-than-temporarily impaired and, accordingly, recognized impairment charges of

$6 million

,

$17 million

and

$3 million

, respectively.

The inputs used to measure the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets of the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment are classified as a Level 3 fair value measurement due to the significance of unobservable inputs using company-specific information. The valuation methodology used to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 9, Goodwill, Purchased Technology and Other Intangible Assets.

Other

The carrying amounts of Applied’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to the short maturities of these financial instruments. At

October 27, 2013

, the carrying amount of long-term debt was

$1.9 billion

and the estimated fair value was

$2.1 billion

. At

October 28, 2012

, the carrying amount of long-term debt was

$1.9 billion

and the estimated fair value was

$2.3 billion

. The estimated fair value of long-term debt is determined by Level 2 inputs and is based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Derivative Financial Instruments

Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as the Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel, Taiwanese dollar and Swiss franc. Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically up to the next

24 months

. The purpose of Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency exchange contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of any hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All of Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value in other current assets or in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and are typically entered into once per month. Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. The majority of the after-tax net income or loss related to derivative instruments included in AOCI at

October 27, 2013

is expected to be reclassified into earnings within

12 months

. Changes in the fair value of currency forward exchange and option contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. Both ineffective hedge amounts and hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings. If the transaction being hedged is no longer probable to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is deemed to be ineffective, Applied promptly recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument in general and administrative expenses. The amount recognized due to discontinuance of cash flow hedges that were probable not to occur by the end of the originally specified time period was not significant for fiscal


,


or


.

Additionally, forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. These derivatives are typically entered into once per month and are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, the Company purchased foreign exchange option contracts to limit its foreign exchange risk associated with the announced business combination with Tokyo Electron Limited (TEL). The derivatives used to hedge our currency exposure did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. These derivatives are marked to market at the end of each reporting period with gains and losses recognized as general and administrative expenses. At

October 27, 2013

, the fair value of these foreign exchange option contracts was approximately

$17 million

. The Company recognized a loss of

$7 million

during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 related to such contracts. The cash flow impact of this derivative has been classified as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows. To further mitigate credit exposure in connection with these foreign exchange option contracts, the Company entered into security arrangements with certain counterparties, which require the counterparties to post collateral amounting to the approximate fair value of the derivative contracts.  The cash collateral is included in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated statements of financial position, with the corresponding liability included in accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Other than the foreign exchange option contracts discussed in the preceding paragraph, the fair values of other derivative instruments at

October 27, 2013

and

October 28, 2012

were not material.

Credit Risk Contingent Features

If Applied’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of credit risk contingent provisions of the derivative instruments discussed above, and certain counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position was immaterial as of

Business Combinations

Tokyo Electron Limited

On September 24, 2013, Applied and TEL entered into a definitive agreement to effect a strategic combination of their respective businesses into a new combined company through a “merger of equals.” TEL, a Japanese corporation, is a global provider of semiconductor, flat panel display and photovoltaic panel production equipment. Under the terms of the Agreement, TEL shareholders will receive

3.25

shares of the new combined company for every TEL share held. Applied shareholders will receive

one

share of the new combined company for every Applied share held. Based on the number of shares of Applied common stock and shares of TEL common stock expected to be issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the transaction, it is anticipated that, immediately following the transaction, former Applied stockholders and former TEL shareholders will own approximately

68%

and

32%

, respectively, of the new combined company.

The new combined company will have a new name, dual headquarters in Tokyo and Santa Clara, and a dual listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, and will be incorporated in the Netherlands. The closing of the transaction is subject to customary conditions, including approval by Applied’s and TEL’s shareholders and regulatory approvals. It is expected that the combined company will commence a

$3.0 billion

stock repurchase program targeted to be executed within 12 months following the closing of the transaction.

The business combination agreement contains mutual pre-closing covenants, including the obligation of Applied and TEL to conduct their businesses in the ordinary course consistent in all material respects with past practices. The agreement also contains termination rights for Applied and TEL and provides that upon certain events, such as a termination due to a change in recommendation by the other party or a termination relating to certain tax rulings, a termination fee of

$400 million

is payable.

Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, Inc.

On

November 10, 2011

, Applied completed the acquisition of Varian, a public company manufacturer of semiconductor processing equipment and the leading supplier of ion implantation equipment used by chip makers globally, for an aggregate purchase price of

$4.2 billion

in cash, net of cash acquired and assumed earned equity awards of

$27 million

, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of

May 3, 2011

.  Applied's primary reasons for this acquisition were to complement existing product offerings and to provide opportunities for future growth. Varian designs, markets, manufactures and services ion implantation systems.

Applied allocated the purchase price of this acquisition to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values. These estimates were determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques. Applied recorded

$2.6 billion

in goodwill, which represented the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition. Of this amount,

$1.8 billion

of goodwill was allocated to the Silicon Systems Group segment, and the remainder was allocated to the Applied Global Services segment. Goodwill associated with the acquisition was primarily attributable to the opportunities from the addition of Varian's product portfolio which complement Applied's Silicon Systems Group's suite of products, including providing integrated process solutions to customers. Goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, Applied completed the purchase price allocation for the Varian acquisition.

The following table summarizes the allocation of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date:

The following table presents details of the purchase price allocated to purchased intangible assets of Varian at the acquisition date:

The results of operations of Varian are included in Applied's consolidated results of operations, primarily in the results for the Silicon Systems Group and Applied Global Services segments, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. For the fiscal year ended October 28, 2012, net sales of approximately

$1.0 billion

and operating loss of approximately

$148 million

attributable to Varian were included in the consolidated results of operations. For the year ended October 28, 2012, results of operations included charges of

$332 million

, attributable to inventory fair value adjustments on products sold, amortization of purchased intangible assets, share-based compensation associated with accelerated vesting, deal costs and other integration costs associated with the acquisition. Of these amounts, deal costs and other acquisition-related costs of

$45 million

were not allocated to the segments for the year ended October 28, 2012. Deal costs are included in selling, general and administrative expenses in Applied's consolidated results of operations.

The following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations assume the acquisition was completed as of the beginning of fiscal 2011. The pro forma consolidated results of operations for the year ended October 30, 2011 combine the results of Applied for the year ended October 30, 2011, with the results of Varian for the year ended September 30, 2011.

The pro forma results below include adjustments related to the purchase price allocation and financing of the acquisition, primarily to increase depreciation and amortization with the higher values of property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets, to increase interest expense for the additional debt incurred to complete the acquisition, and to reflect the related income tax effect. The pro forma results for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2011 include costs of

$128 million

Note 9

Goodwill, Purchased Technology and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Applied assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition. Typically, acquisitions relate to a single reporting unit and thus do not require the allocation of goodwill to multiple reporting units. If the products obtained in an acquisition are assigned to multiple reporting units, the goodwill is distributed to the respective reporting units as part of the purchase price allocation process.

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment, especially in emerging markets. Applied regularly monitors current business conditions and other factors including, but not limited to, adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions and lower projections of profitability that may impact future operating results.

To test goodwill for impairment, Applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, Applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, Applied would, in the first step, compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Applied determines the fair value of each of its reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, then Applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If Applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference. Applied’s reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 16, Industry Segment Operations, which are based on the manner in which Applied operates its business and the nature of those operations.

During fiscal 2012, the solar industry faced increasing challenges, including manufacturing overcapacity and weak operating performance and outlook, which led to a deterioration in market conditions. As a result, Applied performed a two-step goodwill impairment test and recorded a

$421 million

goodwill impairment charge in its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2013, the solar industry experienced further deterioration of market conditions associated with continued manufacturing overcapacity and weaker operating performance and outlook, resulting in increased uncertainties regarding the timing and nature of a recovery in solar capital equipment expenditures. Taking these factors into account, Applied reassessed its financial outlook for the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit and consequently reevaluated the recoverability of this reporting unit's goodwill. Applied performed the two-step impairment test and concluded that the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value. Based on Applied's analyses, the implied fair value of goodwill was substantially lower than the carrying value of goodwill for the reporting unit. As a result, in the second quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied recorded a goodwill impairment charge of

$224 million

, representing all of the remaining goodwill for this reporting unit. As of October 27, 2013, accumulated goodwill impairment charges amounted to

$645 million

which were recorded in the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.

Applied also performed an impairment test for long-lived assets associated with the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit and determined that the majority of intangible assets were impaired mostly due to the lower long-term revenue and profitability outlook associated with products related to these intangible assets. Accordingly, during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied recorded an impairment charge of

$54 million

related to these intangible assets, which was the amount by which the carrying value of these intangible assets exceeded their estimated fair value, based on discounted projected cash flows.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Applied utilized an equal weighting of both the discounted cash flow method of the income approach and the guideline company method of the market approach to estimate the fair value of the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit. The estimates used in the impairment testing were consistent with the discrete forecasts that Applied uses to manage its business, and considered the significant developments that occurred during the quarter. Under the discounted cash flow method, cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considered the long-term earnings growth rate specific to the Energy and Environmental Solutions reporting unit. The estimated future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate that was the value-weighted average of the reporting unit's estimated cost of equity and debt derived using both known and estimated market metrics, and was adjusted to reflect risk factors that considered both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows. The tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method reflected the international structure currently in place, which is consistent with the market participant perspective. Under the guideline company method, market multiples were applied to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The market multiples used were consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal


, Applied performed a qualitative assessment to test goodwill for all reporting units for impairment and determined that it was more likely than not that each of the Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, and Display reporting units' fair values exceeded their respective carrying values and that it was not necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test for these reporting units.

The evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment. In the event of future changes in business conditions, Applied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. If the results of these analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at that time.

Details of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets were as follows:

During fiscal 2013, goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets decreased by

$224 million

due to the impairment of goodwill recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2013.

Other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization consist primarily of in-process technology, which will be subject to amortization upon commercialization. The fair value assigned to in-process technology was determined using the income approach taking into account estimates and judgments regarding risks inherent in the development process, including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance. If an in-process technology project is abandoned, the acquired technology attributable to the project will be written-off.

A summary of Applied's purchased technology and intangible assets is set forth below:

Finite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets

Applied amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from


to


years.

Applied evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. Applied assesses the fair value of the assets based on the amount of the undiscounted future cash flow that the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset, plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When Applied identifies an impairment, Applied reduces the carrying value of the group of assets to comparable market values, when available and appropriate, or to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach.

Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. Applied evaluates the useful lives of its intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances require revising the remaining period of amortization. In addition, Applied reviews intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Management considers such indicators as significant differences in actual product acceptance from the estimates, changes in the competitive and economic environment, technological advances, and changes in cost structure.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied performed an impairment analysis on the carrying value of its intangible assets and determined that there was no impairment.

Details of finite-lived intangible assets were as follows:

During fiscal


, the impact of the impairment of certain intangible assets associated with the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment on the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of the finite-lived intangible assets was approximately

Share-Based Compensation

Applied has a stockholder approved equity plan, the Employee Stock Incentive Plan, which permits grants to employees of share-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units. In addition, the plan provides for the automatic grant of restricted stock units to non-employee directors and permits the grant of share-based awards to non-employee directors and consultants. Share-based awards made beginning in March 2012 under the plan may be subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances in the event of a change in control of Applied. Applied also has

Stock Options

Applied grants options to purchase, at future dates, shares of its common stock to employees and consultants. The exercise price of each stock option equals the fair market value of Applied common stock on the date of grant. Options typically vest over

three

to

four

years, subject to the grantee’s continued service with Applied through the scheduled vesting date, and expire no later than

seven

years from the grant date. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model was developed for use in estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Applied’s employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of publicly traded options.

-for-one basis. Restricted stock has the same rights as other issued and outstanding shares of Applied common stock except these shares generally have no right to dividends and are held in escrow until the award vests. Performance shares and performance units are awards that result in a payment to a grantee in shares of Applied common stock on a

one

-for-one basis if performance goals and/or other vesting criteria established by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of Applied's Board of Directors (the Committee) are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. Restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance shares and performance units typically vest over

four

years and vesting is usually subject to the grantee’s continued service with Applied and, in some cases, achievement of specified performance goals. The compensation expense related to the service-based awards is determined using the fair market value of Applied common stock on the date of the grant, and the compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period.

Restricted stock, performance shares and performance units granted to certain executive officers are also subject to the achievement of specified performance goals (performance-based awards). These performance-based awards become eligible to vest only if performance goals are achieved and then actually will vest only if the grantee remains employed by Applied through each applicable vesting date. These performance-based awards require the achievement of targeted levels of relative adjusted annual operating profit margin. For the fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012 performance-based awards, additional shares become eligible for time-based vesting if Applied achieves certain levels of total shareholder return (TSR) relative to a peer group comprised of companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Information Technology Index measured at the end of a two-year period.

In September 2013, the Committee approved the amendment of certain outstanding performance-based awards, so that applicable performance goals will be deemed satisfied at target levels effective as of either three days prior to the closing of the announced business combination between Applied and TEL, or the date the proposed business combination is terminated. The vesting of the awards will remain subject to time-based vesting. In addition, the Committee also approved the amendment of certain outstanding awards held by executive officers to provide that if the award is outstanding and subject solely to time-based vesting as of three trading days prior to the closing of the business combination agreement with TEL, vesting of the portion of the award that is otherwise scheduled to vest during calendar year 2014 will accelerate.

The fair value of these performance-based awards is estimated on the date of grant and assumes that the specified performance goals will be achieved. If the goals are achieved, these awards vest over a specified remaining service period of generally

three

or

four

years, provided that the grantee remains employed by Applied through each scheduled vesting date. If the performance goals are not met, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. The expected cost of each award is reflected over the service period and is reduced for estimated forfeitures.

Employee Benefit Plans

Employee Bonus Plans

Applied has various employee bonus plans. A discretionary bonus plan provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax income to Applied employees who are not participants in other performance-based incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of eligible compensation. Other plans provide for bonuses to Applied’s executives and other key contributors based on the achievement of profitability and/or other specified performance criteria. Charges under these plans were

Employee Savings and Retirement Plan

Applied’s Employee Savings and Retirement Plan (the 401(k) Plan) is qualified under Sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). Effective as of the close of the stock market on December 31, 2012, the Varian-sponsored 401(k) plan was merged with and into the 401(k) Plan, with the 401(k) Plan being the surviving plan. Eligible employees may make salary deferral and catch-up contributions under the 401(k) Plan on a pre-tax basis and/or (effective as of the first payroll period beginning on or after December 22, 2012) on a Roth basis, subject to an annual dollar limit established by the Code.

Applied matches

100%

3%

of eligible contribution and then

50%

Defined Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries and Other Post-Retirement Benefits

Several of Applied’s foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their eligible employees. Benefits under these plans are typically based on years of service and final average compensation levels. The plans are managed in accordance with applicable local statutes and practices. Applied deposits funds for certain of these plans with insurance companies, pension trustees, government-managed accounts, and/or accrues the expense for the unfunded portion of the benefit obligation on its Consolidated Financial Statements. Applied’s practice is to fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements as established by applicable local governmental oversight and taxing authorities. Depending on the design of the plan, local custom and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets. The differences between the aggregate projected benefit obligations and aggregate plan assets of these plans have been recorded as liabilities by Applied and are included in other liabilities and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Applied also has a U.S. post-retirement plan that provides certain medical and vision benefits to eligible retirees who are at least age


and whose years of service plus their age equals at least


at their date of retirement. An eligible retiree also may elect coverage for an eligible spouse or domestic partner who is not eligible for Medicare. Coverage under the plan generally ends for both the retiree and spouse or domestic partner upon becoming eligible for Medicare. In addition, Applied also has a post-retirement benefit plan as a result of the acquisition of Varian. Applied’s liability under these post-retirement plans, which was included in other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was

$34 million

at

October 27, 2013

Applied’s investment strategy for its defined benefit plans is to invest plan assets in a prudent manner, maintaining well-diversified portfolios with the long-term objective of meeting the obligations of the plans as they come due. Asset allocation decisions are typically made by plan fiduciaries with input from Applied’s international pension committee. Applied’s asset allocation strategy incorporates a sufficient equity exposure in order for the plans to benefit from the expected better long-term performance of equities relative to the plans’ liabilities. Applied retains investment managers, where appropriate, to manage the assets of the plans. Performance of investment managers is monitored by plan fiduciaries with the assistance of local investment consultants. The investment managers make investment decisions within the guidelines set forth by plan fiduciaries. Risk management practices include diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and periodic rebalancing toward target asset allocation ranges. Investment managers may use derivative instruments for efficient portfolio management purposes. Plan assets do not include any of Applied’s own equity or debt securities.

Executive Deferred Compensation Plans

Applied sponsors two unfunded deferred compensation plans, the Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (Predecessor EDCP) and the 2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (2005 EDCP), under which certain employees may elect to defer a portion of their following year’s eligible earnings. The Predecessor EDCP was frozen as of December 31, 2004 such that no new deferrals could be made under the plan after that date and the plan would qualify for “grandfather” relief under Section 409A of the Code. The Predecessor EDCP participant accounts continue to be maintained under the plan and credited with deemed interest. The 2005 EDCP was implemented by Applied effective as of January 1, 2005 and is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. In addition, Applied also sponsors a non-qualified deferred compensation plan as a result of the acquisition of Varian. Amounts payable, including accrued deemed interest, totaled

$49 million

at

October 27, 2013

and

$57 million

at

October 28, 2012

The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 was significantly lower than the rate for fiscal 2012 due primarily to the geographic composition of Applied's pre-tax income, lower nondeductible goodwill impairment charges, and reinstatement of the U.S. federal research and development tax credit retroactive to its expiration in December 2012.  These reductions were partially offset by a lower benefit in fiscal 2013 from the U.S. federal domestic production deduction, which was limited by U.S. federal taxable income. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2012 was significantly higher than the rate for fiscal 2011 due primarily to the nondeductible goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2012 and the fiscal 2011 benefit from the December 2010 reinstatement of the U.S. R&D tax credit retroactive to its expiration in December 2009.

A valuation allowance is recorded to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized.  A valuation allowance was established against state research and development credit carryforwards and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards where it is believed that it is not more likely than not that the carryforwards will be realized.

Applied has been granted tax holidays for certain of its subsidiaries in Singapore, China and Israel. The tax benefit arising from these tax holidays was

$15 million

for


(

$0.08

per diluted share). The tax holidays expire at various times through 2026, excluding potential renewals, and are subject to certain conditions with which the Company expects to comply.

For fiscal


, U.S. income taxes have not been provided for approximately

$2.2 billion

of cumulative undistributed earnings of several non-U.S. subsidiaries. Applied intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the U.S. If these earnings were distributed to the United States in the form of dividends or otherwise, or if the shares of the relevant foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred, Applied would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes (subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits) and foreign withholding taxes. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.

At

October 27, 2013

, Applied has state research and development tax credit carryforwards of

$109 million

, including

$89 million

of credits that are carried over until exhausted and

$19 million

which are carried over for


years and begin to expire in fiscal 2021. Applied has a

$51 million

federal foreign tax credit carryforward which may be carried over


years and expires in fiscal 2022. Applied has a

$19 million

federal research and development tax credit carryover which may be carried over for


years and begins to expire in fiscal 2032. Applied has a net operating loss carryover in state jurisdictions of

$65 million

which begin to expire in fiscal 2018.  Management believes it is more likely than not that all loss and tax credit carryovers at

October 27, 2013

, net of valuation allowance, will be utilized in future periods.

Applied’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits associated with employee stock option transactions. These benefits, credited directly to stockholders’ equity with a corresponding reduction to taxes payable, amounted to

$11 million

for fiscal 2013,

$2 million

for fiscal 2012, and

$4 million

for fiscal 2011.

Applied maintains liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These liabilities involve considerable judgment and estimation and are continuously monitored by management based on the best information available. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:

Increases or decreases to interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions were included in the provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were

$7 million

as of

October 27, 2013

and

$7 million

as of

October 28, 2012

and were classified as a non-current liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In fiscal 2013, Applied received a refund of

$31 million

, including interest, as a result of settling an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit of fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. This resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of

$12 million

in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. In fiscal 2013, Applied paid

$14 million

to the IRS as part of an ongoing audit of the Varian subsidiary for fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2012. No tax expense or benefit was recognized. In fiscal


, Applied received a refund of

$276 million

, including interest, as a result of settling an IRS audit for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. This resulted in the recognition of a tax benefit of

$176 million

in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for fiscal


, which was net of previously recognized tax benefits.

A number of Applied’s tax returns remain subject to examination by taxing authorities. These include U.S. federal returns for fiscal

2010 and later years

, California returns for fiscal

2009 and later years

, tax returns for certain other states for fiscal

2009 and later years

The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations, as well as the amounts and timing of various tax payments that may be part of the settlement process, is highly uncertain. This could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet classification of current assets and non-current assets and liabilities. Applied continues to have ongoing negotiations with various taxing authorities throughout the year.  During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that audit resolutions and the expiration of statutes of limitation could reduce our unrecognized tax benefits by up to

$115 million

Guarantees

In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of

October 27, 2013

, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately

$41 million

. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.

Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of

Legal Matters

Korea Criminal Proceedings

In 2010, the Seoul Eastern District Court began hearings on indictments brought by the Seoul Prosecutor's Office for the Eastern District of Korea (the Prosecutor's Office) alleging that employees of several companies improperly received and used confidential information belonging to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Samsung), a major Applied customer based in Korea. The individuals charged included the former head of Applied Materials Korea (AMK), who at the time of the indictment was a vice president of Applied Materials, Inc., and certain other AMK employees. Neither Applied nor any of its subsidiaries was named as a party to the proceedings. Hearings on these matters concluded in November 2012 and the Court issued its decision on February 7, 2013. As part of the ruling,

nine

AMK employees (including the former head of AMK) were acquitted of all charges, while

one

AMK employee was found guilty on some of the charges and received a suspended jail sentence. The Prosecutor's Office and various individuals filed notices of appeal, and hearings are underway in the appeals. The current round of hearings in the appeals is scheduled to conclude at the end of December 2013, with final briefing and a ruling expected early in 2014.

Other Matters

From time to time, Applied receives notification from third parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking indemnification, litigation support, payment of money or other actions by Applied in connection with claims made against them. In addition, from time to time, Applied receives notification from third parties claiming that Applied may be or is infringing or misusing their intellectual property or other rights. Applied also is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business.

Although the outcome of the above-described matters, claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not believe that any will have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Industry Segment Operations

Applied’s

four

reportable segments are: Silicon Systems Group, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental Solutions. As defined under the accounting literature, Applied’s chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the President and Chief Executive Officer, who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire Company. Segment information is presented based upon Applied’s management organization structure as of

October 27, 2013

and the distinctive nature of each segment. Future changes to this internal financial structure may result in changes to Applied’s reportable segments.

Each reportable segment is separately managed and has separate financial results that are reviewed by Applied’s chief operating decision-maker. Each reportable segment contains closely related products that are unique to the particular segment. Segment operating income is determined based upon internal performance measures used by Applied’s chief operating decision-maker.

Applied derives the segment results directly from its internal management reporting system. The accounting policies Applied uses to derive reportable segment results are substantially the same as those used for external reporting purposes. Management measures the performance of each reportable segment based upon several metrics including orders, net sales and operating income. Management uses these results to evaluate the performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments. Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate level, which include costs related to share-based compensation; certain management, finance, legal, human resources, and research, development and engineering functions provided at the corporate level; and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. In addition, Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions, unless these actions pertain to a specific reportable segment. Segment operating income excludes interest income/expense and other financial charges and income taxes. Management does not consider the unallocated costs in measuring the performance of the reportable segments.

The Silicon Systems Group segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for etch, rapid thermal processing, deposition, chemical mechanical planarization, metrology and inspection, wafer packaging, and ion implantation.

The Applied Global Services segment includes technically differentiated products and services to improve operating efficiency, reduce operating costs and lessen the environmental impact of semiconductor, display and solar customers' factories. Applied Global Services’ products consist of spares, services, certain earlier generation products, remanufactured equipment, and products that have reached a particular stage in the product lifecycle. Customer demand for these products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites.

The Display segment includes products for manufacturing LCDs, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), and other display technologies for TVs, personal computers, tablets, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices.

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules, high throughput roll-to-roll deposition equipment for flexible electronics and other applications.

In November 2011, Applied completed its acquisition of Varian. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012, the acquired business is primarily included in the results for the Silicon Systems Group and Applied Global Services segments, with certain corporate functions included in corporate and unallocated costs.

With the acquisition of Varian, Applied acquired ion implantation technology for semiconductor as well as for c-Si solar cell manufacturing, which was recorded under the Silicon Systems Group segment in fiscal 2012. In fiscal 2013, Applied began marketing the solar implant products commercially through its Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. Accordingly, effective in the first quarter of fiscal 2013, Applied accounts for its solar implant products under the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment. The effect of the solar implant products was not material to the operations of either the Silicon Systems Group or Energy and Environmental Solutions segments.
