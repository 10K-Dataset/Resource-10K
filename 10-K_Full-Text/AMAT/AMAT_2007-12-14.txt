    CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1:

Business

Incorporated in 1967, Applied, a Delaware corporation, provides
    Nanomanufacturing
    Technology

tm

solutions for the global semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar and related industries, with a broad portfolio of
    innovative equipment, service and software products.
    “Nanomanufacturing” is the production of ultra-small
    structures, including the engineering of thin layers of film
    onto substrates. Applied’s customers include manufacturers
    of semiconductor chips and wafers, flat panel liquid crystal
    displays (LCDs), photovoltaic (PV) cells and other electronic
    devices, who use what they manufacture in their own end products
    or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced
    electronic components. The Company’s fiscal year ends on
    the last Sunday in October.

Applied is the world’s largest semiconductor fabrication
    equipment supplier, based on revenue, with the capability to
    provide global deployment and support services. Applied also is
    a global leader in LCD fabrication equipment, and is gaining
    momentum to become a leading supplier of PV manufacturing
    solutions to the emerging solar industry.

Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon, Fab
    Solutions, Display, and Adjacent Technologies. A summary of
    financial information for each reportable segment is found in
    Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A
    discussion of factors that could affect Applied’s
    operations is set forth under “Risk Factors” in
    Item 1A, which is incorporated herein by reference.

Silicon
    Segment

Applied’s Silicon Systems Group (SSG), reported under its
    Silicon segment, develops, manufactures and sells a wide range
    of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips
    or integrated circuits. Most chips are built on a silicon wafer
    base and include a variety of circuit components, such as
    transistors and other devices, that are connected by multiple
    layers of wiring (interconnects). Applied offers systems that
    perform most of the primary steps in the chip fabrication
    process, including: atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical
    vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), etch,
    rapid thermal processing (RTP), chemical mechanical
    planarization (CMP), wafer wet cleaning, and wafer metrology and
    inspection, as well as systems that etch, measure and inspect
    circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process.
    Applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are used by
    both integrated device manufacturers and foundries to build
    memory, logic and other types of chips.

To build a chip, the transistors, capacitors and other circuit
    components are first created on the surface of the wafer by
    performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively
    remove successive film layers. Similar processes are then used
    to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer. As the
    density of the circuit components increases to enable greater
    computing power in the same or smaller area, the complexity of
    building the chip also increases, necessitating more process
    steps to form smaller structures and more intricate wiring
    schemes. A typical, simplified process sequence for building the
    wiring portion of chips involves initially depositing a
    dielectric film layer onto the base layer of circuit components
    using a CVD system. An etch system is then used to create
    openings and patterns in the dielectric layer. To form the metal
    wiring, these openings and patterns are subsequently filled with
    conducting material using PVD

and/or

electroplating technologies. A CMP step then polishes the wafer
    to achieve a flat surface. Additional deposition, etch and CMP
    steps are then performed to build up the layers of wiring needed
    to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements to form
    the chip. Advanced chip designs require about 500 steps
    involving these and other processes to complete the
    manufacturing cycle.

A significant portion of the process steps used in chipmaking
    are performed to build the interconnect, a complex matrix of
    microscopic wires that carry electrical signals to connect the
    transistor and capacitor components of a chip. While some
    customers building memory chips are still using aluminum as the
    main conducting material for the interconnect, logic customers
    have transitioned to copper. Copper has lower resistance than
    aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller area. Applied
    is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing
    copper-based chips, and supplies systems for depositing, etching
    and planarizing the copper interconnect layers. Complementing
    the transition to copper to improve chip speed is the use of low
    dielectric constant (low k) films to replace silicon
    dioxide material as the insulator between the copper wiring
    structures. Applied leads the industry in providing systems for
    depositing low k dielectric films.



The transistor is another key area of the chip in which
    semiconductor manufacturers are improving their device designs
    to enhance speed. Applied has the industry’s largest
    portfolio of technically advanced products for building smaller
    and faster transistors. One such area is strain engineering, a
    technique that stretches or compresses the space between atoms,
    allowing electrical current to flow more quickly, thus greatly
    enhancing chip performance. Multiple strain films are typically
    used in advanced devices since they have an additive effect on
    increasing transistor speed. Applied has a comprehensive
    portfolio of systems to enable these applications using CVD and
    epitaxial deposition technologies.

Most chips currently are fabricated using 65 nanometer (nm) and
    larger linewidth dimensions. Beginning at the 45nm technology
    node, major chipmakers have announced they will be integrating
    new high dielectric constant (high-k) and metal materials and
    processes in the transistor gate structure to reduce current
    leakage and enable faster switching speed. In 2007, Applied
    announced a comprehensive portfolio of fully characterized
    processes for building these high-k/metal gates. These solutions
    include an integrated dielectric gate stack tool that combines
    four critical processes in a single system, a portfolio of
    metallization technologies using ALD and PVD, and an innovative
    high temperature etch system.

Most of Applied’s semiconductor equipment products are
    single-wafer systems with multiple process chambers attached to
    a base platform. This enables each wafer to be processed
    separately in its own environment, allowing precise process
    control, while the system’s multiple chambers enable
    simultaneous, high productivity manufacturing. Applied sells
    most of its single-wafer, multi-chamber systems on four basic
    platforms: the
    Centura

®

,
    the
    Endura

®

,
    the
    Producer

®

and the
    Vantage

®

.
    These platforms currently support ALD, CVD, PVD, etch and RTP
    technologies.

Over time, the semiconductor industry has migrated to
    increasingly larger wafers to build chips. The predominant or
    common wafer size used today for the volume production of
    advanced chips is 300 millimeter (mm), or

12-inch,

wafers. Applied offers a comprehensive range of 300mm, as well
    as earlier-generation 200mm systems. Applied also offers
    products and services to support its systems, which are reported
    under its Fab Solutions segment.

The following summarizes Applied’s portfolio of products
    and their associated process technology areas reported under its
    Silicon segment.

Deposition

Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a chip. During
    deposition, layers of dielectric (an insulator), barrier, or
    electrically conductive (typically metal) films are deposited or
    grown on a wafer. Applied currently provides equipment to
    perform the three main types of deposition: ALD, CVD and PVD. In
    addition, Applied’s RTP systems can be used to perform
    certain types of dielectric deposition.

Atomic
    Layer Deposition

ALD is an advanced technology in which atoms are deposited one
    layer at a time to build chip structures. This technology
    enables customers to fabricate thin films of either conducting
    or insulating material with uniform coverage in sub-nanometer
    sized structures. Applied offers ALD chambers for depositing
    tungsten, tantalum nitride and high-k films. The Applied Endura
    iCuBS

tm

product is the industry’s first system to integrate ALD and
    PVD chambers on a single platform for depositing critical
    barrier and seed layers in copper interconnects. The Applied
    Centura
    iSprint

tm

Tungsten system (iSprint) combines an ALD chamber, which
    deposits a tungsten nucleation film, with a CVD tungsten bulk
    fill process in one system. The iSprint is used to form contact
    structures that connect the transistors to the wiring areas of
    the chip. Applied’s high-k ALD process is part of the
    Centura Advanced Gate Stack system which enables a single
    integrated solution for building high-k/metal gate structures.

Chemical
    Vapor Deposition

CVD is used by customers to deposit dielectric and metal films
    on a wafer. During the CVD process, gases that contain atoms of
    the material to be deposited react on the wafer surface, forming
    a thin film of solid material. Films deposited by CVD may be
    silicon oxide, single-crystal epitaxial silicon, amorphous
    silicon, silicon nitride,



dielectric anti-reflective coatings, low k dielectric (for
    highly efficient insulating materials), aluminum, titanium,
    titanium nitride, polysilicon, tungsten, refractory metals or
    silicides. Applied offers the following CVD products and
    technologies:

The Applied Centura Ultima
    HDP-CVD

®

system

— High-density plasma CVD (HDP-CVD) is used
    to fill very small, deep spaces (gap-fill) with dielectric film.
    This product is used by a number of major integrated circuit
    manufacturers for gap-fill applications, including the
    deposition of silicon oxides in substrate isolation structures,
    contacts and interconnect.

The Applied Producer CVD platform

— This
    high-throughput platform features
    Twin-Chamber

tm

modules that have two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up
    to three Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer
    platform, giving it a simultaneous processing capacity of six
    wafers. Many dielectric CVD processes can be performed on this
    platform.

Low k Dielectric Films

— Many integrated
    circuit manufacturers are now incorporating new low
    k dielectric materials in their copper-based chip designs
    to further improve interconnect speed. The Applied Producer
    Black
    Diamond

®

CVD low k system is used by several customers in volume
    production to produce some of the industry’s most advanced
    devices. Using conventional CVD equipment, the Black Diamond
    product provides customers with a proven, cost-effective way to
    transition to this new material. The Applied Producer Black
    Diamond II is a second-generation dielectric deposition
    system that provides a lower k-value film for building faster 65
    nm generation and below chip designs. A complementary low k
    dielectric, called the Applied Producer
    BLOk

tm

(Barrier low k), enables the complete, multi-layer dielectric
    structure to benefit from low k technology. In 2007, Applied
    introduced a second generation of this technology, the Applied
    Producer BLOk II, for 45nm and below applications.

Lithography-Enabling Solutions

— Applied offers
    several technologies on the Producer system to help chipmakers
    extend their current 193nm lithography tools, including the
    Applied
    APF

tm

(advanced patterning film) and the Applied
    DARC

®

(dielectric anti-reflective coating) films. Together, they
    provide a film stack with the precise dimensional control and
    compatibility needed to cost-effectively pattern nano-scale
    features without additional integration complexity. In 2007, the
    Company added to its lithography-enabling solutions with the
    Applied Producer ACE SACVD (sub-atmospheric CVD) system for
    fabricating denser memory cells with double patterning
    techniques.

Strain Engineering Solutions

— The Applied
    Producer HARP (high aspect ratio process) system plays a key
    role in overcoming transistor performance challenges by enabling
    chipmakers to boost chip speed by depositing strain inducing
    dielectric films in transistor structures, while also enabling
    geometric device scaling with high aspect ratio gap-fill
    capability. Offering the industry’s first integrated stress
    nitride deposition and ultraviolet (UV) cure solution, the
    Applied Producer Celera CVD delivers benchmark levels of
    high-stress tensile silicon nitride films. The Company also
    offers the Applied Centura SiNgenPlus LPCVD (low pressure
    CVD) system for low temperature silicon nitride films. Used
    together, and in conjunction with silicon germanium (SiGe) films
    using Applied’s epitaxial deposition technologies, these
    systems can provide additive strain engineering benefits.

Epitaxial Deposition

— Epitaxial silicon
    (epitaxy or epi) is a layer of pure silicon grown in a uniform
    crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high quality base
    for the device circuitry. Epi technology is used in an
    increasing number of integrated circuit devices in both the
    wafer substrate and transistor areas of a chip to enhance speed.
    The Applied Centura Epi system integrates pre- and post-epi
    processes on the same system to improve film quality and reduce
    production costs. This system is also used for SiGe epi
    technology, which reduces power usage and increases speed in
    certain types of advanced chips. For emerging transistor
    designs, the Applied Centura RP Epi system offers selective epi
    processes to enable faster transistor switching through strain
    engineering techniques.

Polysilicon Deposition

— Polysilicon is a type
    of silicon used to form portions of the transistor structure
    within the integrated circuit device. The Applied Centura
    Polygen

tm

LPCVD (low pressure CVD) system is a single-wafer,
    multi-chamber product that deposits thin, polysilicon films at
    high temperatures to create transistor gate structures. To
    address the challenging requirements of shrinking transistor
    gate structures, the



Applied Centura DPN Gate Stack system integrates chambers for
    decoupled plasma nitridation (DPN), RTP anneal and polysilicon
    deposition on one platform to enable superior film quality and
    material properties.

Aluminum Deposition

— Aluminum (Al) continues
    to be the material used by many memory manufacturers for
    interconnects. The Applied Endura iFill Al CVD CVD/PVD system is
    used for building high-density interconnects in Flash and DRAM
    memory chips. This advanced process, for sub-90nm generations,
    enables customers to replace tungsten structures with aluminum
    to achieve faster chips with fewer steps and less cost.

Tungsten Deposition

— Tungsten is used in the
    contact area of a chip that connects the transistors to the
    wiring circuitry. In aluminum-based devices, tungsten is also
    used in the structures that connect the multiple layers of
    aluminum wiring. Applied has two products for depositing
    tungsten: the Applied Centura
    Sprint

®

Tungsten CVD system for 90nm and below devices and the Applied
    Centura iSprint ALD/CVD system for more advanced applications.
    The latter product combines ALD technology and CVD chambers on
    the same platform.

Physical
    Vapor Deposition

PVD, also called sputtering, is a physical process in which
    atoms of a gas, such as argon, are accelerated toward a metal
    target. The metal atoms chip off, or sputter away, and are then
    deposited on the wafer. Applied leads the industry in PVD
    technology with its Applied Endura PVD system. This system
    offers a broad range of advanced deposition processes, including
    aluminum, aluminum alloys, cobalt, titanium/titanium nitride,
    tantalum/tantalum nitride, tungsten/tungsten nitride, nickel,
    vanadium and copper.

The Applied Endura CuBS (copper barrier/seed) PVD system is
    widely used by customers for fabricating copper-based chips.
    Using PVD technology, the system deposits critical films that
    prevent copper material from entering other areas of the device
    and primes the structure for the subsequent deposition of bulk
    copper. Applied Siconi pre-clean technology extends the
    system’s capabilities to 45nm and below copper low k
    interconnects.

The Applied Endura system’s highly flexible, multi-chamber
    architecture allows the integration of multiple PVD processes,
    or combinations of metal CVD and PVD technologies, on the same
    system. In addition to the integrated Applied Endura iCuBS
    ALD/PVD system (discussed in the Atomic Layer Deposition
    section), the Applied Endura
    iLB

tm

(integrated liner barrier) system combines a PVD chamber for
    depositing titanium with a CVD chamber for titanium nitride
    deposition to form critical lining layers of interconnect
    structures. These structures are subsequently filled with
    tungsten, aluminum or other materials.

Etch

Etching is used many times throughout the integrated circuit
    manufacturing process to selectively remove material from the
    surface of a wafer. Before etching begins, the wafer is coated
    with a light-sensitive film, called photoresist. A
    photolithography process then projects the circuit pattern onto
    the wafer. Etching removes material only from areas dictated by
    the photoresist pattern. Applied offers a wide range of systems
    for etching dielectric, metal and silicon films to meet the
    requirements of sub-100nm processing.

For dielectric applications, the Applied Centura
    eMax

®

system etches a broad range of dielectric films in the contact
    and interconnect regions of the chip. Applied’s Producer
    Etch system utilizes the Company’s Twin-Chamber Producer
    platform to target cost-sensitive dielectric etch applications
    in 90nm and below design geometries. To address advanced low k
    etch applications, the Applied Centura
    Enabler

®

Etch system performs etch, strip and clean steps in a single
    chamber. The Enabler’s

all-in-one

capability streamlines the process flow for advanced chip
    designs and significantly reduces operating costs. In 2007, the
    Company introduced its Applied Centura Carina system that uses
    innovative, high-temperature technology to deliver the etch
    capability essential for scaling logic and memory devices with
    high-k/metal gates at 45nm and below.

The Applied Centura
    AdvantEdge

tm

Silicon Etch system offers chipmakers high precision gate
    etching for advanced-generation devices. To enable customers to
    scale memory devices, in 2007 the Company launched its Applied
    Centura Mariana Trench Etch, the first system with the
    capability to etch 80:1 aspect ratio structures. For etching
    metals, Applied also introduced in fiscal 2007 the Applied Opus
    AdvantEdge Metal Etch. Using an



optimized 5-chamber platform configuration, this system enables
    customers to extend aluminum interconnect technology and
    productivity to sub-70nm dimensions for Flash and DRAM memory
    applications.

Rapid
    Thermal Processing

RTP is a process in which a wafer is subjected to rapid bursts
    of intense heat that can take the wafer from room temperature to
    more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in less than 10 seconds. A rapid
    thermal process is used mainly for modifying the properties of
    deposited films. The Applied Centura
    Radiance

®

Plus

and Applied Vantage
    RadOx

tm

RTP systems feature advanced RTP technology with differing
    platform designs. While the multi-chamber, Centura platform
    offers exceptional process flexibility, the streamlined
    two-chamber Vantage platform is designed for dedicated
    high-volume manufacturing. These single-wafer RTP systems are
    also used for growing high quality oxide and oxynitride films,
    deposition steps that traditional large batch furnaces can no
    longer achieve with the necessary precision and control. With
    its proprietary radical-based, oxidation process, the Applied
    Vantage RadOx system deposits high-performance transistor gate
    oxides with high productivity and low operating cost for Flash
    memory applications.

Chemical
    Mechanical Planarization

The CMP process removes material from a wafer to create a flat
    (planarized) surface. This process allows subsequent
    photolithography patterning steps to occur with greater accuracy
    and enables film layers to build with minimal height variations.
    The 300mm Applied
    Reflexion

®

LK system leads the industry in CMP technology with important
    features such as integrated cleaning, film measurement and
    process control capabilities. The 300mm Applied Reflexion LK
    Ecmp

tm

system (Ecmp system) features proprietary, electrochemical
    mechanical planarization technology to provide a
    high-performance, cost-effective and extendible solution for
    advanced copper/low k interconnects. This Ecmp system removes
    bulk copper at a high rate by electric charge, making it ideal
    for fragile, ultra-low k films.

Metrology
    and Wafer Inspection

Applied offers several products for measuring and inspecting the
    wafer during various stages of the fabrication process:

Critical
    Dimension and Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscopes
    (CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)

Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an electron beam to
    form images of microscopic features, or critical dimensions
    (CDs), of a patterned wafer at extremely high magnification.
    Applied’s SEM products provide customers with full
    automation, along with the high accuracy and sensitivity needed
    for measuring very small CDs. The Applied
    VeritySEM

tm

Metrology system uses proprietary SEM imaging technology to
    enable precise control of the lithography and etching processes.
    The VeritySEM measures CDs with less than 5 angstrom precision,
    a requirement for 45nm device production, and incorporates
    automation and software advancements for significantly higher
    throughput in production. Applied’s OPC
    Check

tm

software for the VeritySEM system performs automated
    qualification of OPC-based (optical proximity correction) chip
    designs, significantly reducing mask (see Mask Making section
    below) verification time over conventional manual methods.

DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (such as particles,
    scratches or residues) that are first located by a defect
    detection system and then classify the defects to identify their
    source. The high-throughput, fully automatic Applied
    SEMVision

tm

G3 Defect Analysis products enable customers to use this
    technology as an integral part of their production lines to
    analyze defects as small as 30nm with industry-leading
    throughput. The Applied SEMVision G3 FIB integrates advanced
    defect review SEM capability with automated focused ion beam
    (FIB) technology in one system. The FIB provides a
    cross-sectional view of the defects reviewed by the SEM,
    enabling chipmakers to analyze the defects in minutes as part of
    their in-line review process.

Wafer
    Inspection

Using laser-based technology, defects can be detected on
    patterned wafers (wafers with printed circuit images) as they
    move between processing steps. Defects include particles, open
    circuit lines, and shorts between lines.



Incorporating key advances in imaging technology, the Applied
    ComPlus
    3T

tm

Inspection system, for darkfield applications, detects defects
    in devices with design rules of 65nm and below with the high
    speed required for customers’ volume production lines. The
    Applied
    UVision

tm

Inspection system is the industry’s first laser-based,
    three dimensional brightfield tool. Utilizing multi-beam, deep
    ultraviolet (DUV) laser illumination and high efficiency
    detectors, the UVision system uncovers previously undetectable
    defects on the wafer, enabling customers to rapidly resolve
    defect issues and achieve greater chip yields.

Mask
    Making

Masks are used by photolithography systems to transfer
    microscopic circuit designs onto wafers. Since an imperfection
    in a mask may be replicated on the wafer, the mask must be
    virtually defect-free. Applied provides systems for etching,
    measuring and inspecting masks. In 2007, the Company introduced
    the Applied Tetra III Advanced Reticle Etch system, an
    advanced etch tool for fabricating masks, based on
    Applied’s production-proven, decoupled plasma source (DPS)
    wafer etch technology.

Fab
    Solutions Segment

Through Applied Global Services group, reported under its Fab
    Solutions segment, Applied provides products and services
    designed to improve the performance and productivity and reduce
    the environmental impact of the fab operations of semiconductor,
    LCD and solar cell manufacturers. The in-depth expertise and
    best known methods of Applied’s extensive global support
    infrastructure enable Applied to continuously support
    customers’ production requirements. Approximately 2,450
    trained customer engineers and process support engineers are
    deployed in more than a dozen countries. These engineers are
    usually located at or near customers’ fab sites and service
    over 22,000 installed Applied systems, as well as non-Applied
    systems. Applied offers three general types of services:

Fab Services

— Applied offers a portfolio of
    fab-wide operations services to maintain and optimize
    customers’ fabrication facilities. Applied Genuine Parts
    are spare parts manufactured to Applied’s strict technical
    specifications and quality standards. Applied Services provides
    customers with optimized tool performance for improved total
    cost of ownership and a higher return on investment. Through its
    Metron Chamber Performance Services unit, Applied is the
    industry’s leading provider of critical parts cleaning,
    coating refurbishment and analytical testing capabilities. In
    2007, Applied announced the opening of its Advanced Wafer
    Reclaim Center in Taiwan. Using state-of-the-art manufacturing
    systems and software at this center, Applied can extend the
    lifecycle of silicon test wafers by over 45% and reduce
    customers’ costs.

Equipment Services

— Applied provides
    remanufactured and refurbished systems, system enhancements and
    technical training, which are intended to optimize
    customers’ cost of ownership by increasing the efficiency
    and extending the life of their equipment. Applied also offers
    energy-saving solutions through its Metron
    EcoSys

tm

products, the semiconductor industry’s most comprehensive
    line of point-of-use abatement systems. Applied’s EcoSys
    systems help enable chipmakers worldwide to meet environmental
    goals.

Automation Services

— Applied offers automated
    factory-level and tool-level control software systems for
    semiconductor, LCD and solar cell manufacturing facilities. In
    2007, Applied expanded its portfolio of software solutions with
    the acquisition of Brooks Software, a division of Brooks
    Automation, Inc. The Brooks Software products complement
    Applied’s existing software applications, allowing the
    Company to offer customers a comprehensive computer integrated
    manufacturing (CIM) solution. CIM solutions improve fab
    operation performance and provide real-time visibility to
    critical production processes for fast and informed
    decision-making. These enterprise solutions include
    manufacturing execution systems (MES) to automate the production
    of wafers and LCD and solar substrates, advanced process control
    systems, and scheduling and materials handling control systems.
    Applied also offers computerized maintenance management systems
    and performance tracking, and modeling and simulation tools for
    improving asset utilization.

Display
    Segment

Applied’s subsidiary AKT, reported under the Display
    segment, designs, manufactures and sells and services equipment
    to fabricate thin film transistor LCDs for televisions, computer
    displays and other consumer-oriented electronic applications.
    While similarities exist between the technologies utilized in
    chipmaking and LCD



fabrication, the most significant differences are in the size
    and composition of the substrate. Substrates used to manufacture
    LCD panels can be more than 70 times larger in area than 300mm
    wafers and are made of glass, while wafers are made of silicon.
    AKT also develops, manufactures and supports differentiated
    stand-alone equipment for the Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line, discussed further under the Adjacent
    Technologies segment.

Applied supplies a wide range of systems that process and test
    different glass substrate sizes. To meet growing consumer demand
    for larger, more cost-efficient LCD TVs, LCD manufacturers have
    moved to larger-sized substrates. Applied’s latest
    Generation (Gen) 8.5 systems can process substrates sized at 2.2
    x 2.5 meters, which in turn enable the production of up to six

55-inch

LCD
    TV screens.

For fabricating the transistor layer of Gen-8.5 panels, Applied
    offers the AKT-55K PECVD (plasma-enhanced CVD) system that
    uses multi-chamber platform architecture to deposit dielectric
    and semiconducting films. In 2007, the Company launched the
    AKT-PiVot

tm

55KV system, which employs high-productivity, cost-efficient PVD
    technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide
    films on the substrate. For manufacturing the color filter layer
    of LCD panels, Applied offers a fully automated, vertical
    sputtering system, the AKT-NEW
    ARISTO

tm

2200.

Complementing these systems, Applied also offers electron beam
    systems for testing substrates during production for defective
    pixels and other imperfections. The AKT-55K EBT is a Gen-8.5
    tester that features one of the industry’s fastest and most
    accurate pixel test technology with the lowest operating cost.
    The electron beam system’s non-contact test technology
    enables safe testing of high-value LCD TV panels without
    damaging or scratching the display.

Adjacent
    Technologies Segment

The Energy and Environmental Solutions (EES) group, reported
    under the Adjacent Technologies segment, provides manufacturing
    solutions for the generation and conservation of energy. Applied
    entered the solar PV market in 2006 and announced its objective
    to lower the overall cost per watt of solar electricity to
    parity with that of electricity generated by other sources, such
    as the burning of fossil fuels. Applied offers manufacturing
    solutions for both wafer-based crystalline silicon (c-Si), and
    glass-based thin film applications to enable customers to
    increase the conversion efficiency and yields of PV devices.
    Applied’s products include large-area platforms such as the
    ATON

tm

in-line sputtering system for high-quality deposition and
    high-throughput in both c-Si and thin film PV cell
    manufacturing, as well as processes, materials-handling
    technologies and fabrication services.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Applied launched the
    Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line, the world’s only integrated production line
    for manufacturing thin film silicon solar modules using
    5.7 square meter
    (m


)
    glass substrates. These ultra-large panels, which are
    approximately four times the size of thin film solar panels
    offered by others in the industry, are intended for large-scale
    applications such as solar farms and building-integrated PV
    system installations. Applied has entered into multiple
    contracts for its SunFab line with customers in Europe and Asia,
    which have not yet met Applied’s order recognition policy
    and accordingly have not been reported as new orders.

Also in fiscal 2007, Applied expanded its capabilities and
    opportunities in the c-Si technology sector through its
    acquisition of HCT Shaping Systems SA, the world’s leading
    supplier of precision wafering systems used to make c-Si
    substrates. These systems reduce silicon consumption and cost by
    sectioning silicon ingots into ultra-thin wafers used to
    fabricate c-Si solar cells.

Other products reported in this segment include roll-to-roll
    vacuum web coating systems for high-performance deposition of a
    range of films on flexible substrates for functional, aesthetic
    or optical properties. Applied also offers large-area sputtering
    equipment for the production of low-emissivity (Low-E) and solar
    control architectural glass.

Backlog

Applied’s backlog increased from $3.4 billion at
    October 29, 2006 to $3.7 billion at October 28,
    2007. Applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by
    order backlog and customer commitments. Backlog includes only
    orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and
    shipment dates within 12 months have been assigned, or
    shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized, and
    also includes contractual service



revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next
    12 months. Backlog adjustments were positive for fiscal
    2007 and totaled $300 million, consisting primarily of
    backlog obtained from acquired companies, partially offset by
    cancellations and currency adjustments. Customers may delay
    delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject
    to possible cancellation penalties. Due to possible changes in
    delivery schedules and cancellations of orders, Applied’s
    backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of
    actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery
    schedules

and/or

a
    reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a
    material adverse effect on Applied’s business and results
    of operations.

Manufacturing,
    Raw Materials and Supplies

Applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of
    procurement, assembly, test and integration of various
    proprietary and commercial parts, components and subassemblies
    (parts) that are used to manufacture systems. Products in the
    Silicon segment are manufactured in Austin, Texas and Rehovot,
    Israel. Remanufactured products in the Fab Solutions segment are
    produced primarily in Austin, Texas. Products in the Display
    segment are manufactured in Santa Clara, California,
    Alzenau, Germany, and Tainan, Taiwan. Products in the Adjacent
    Technologies segment are manufactured primarily in Alzenau,
    Germany, Cheseaux, Switzerland, and Santa Clara,
    California. Manufacturing requires raw materials, including a
    wide variety of mechanical and electrical components, to be
    manufactured to Applied’s specifications. Applied uses
    numerous companies to supply parts for the manufacture and
    support of its products. Although Applied makes reasonable
    efforts to assure that parts are available from multiple,
    qualified suppliers, this is not always possible. Accordingly,
    some key parts may be obtained from only a single supplier or a
    limited group of suppliers. Applied seeks to reduce costs and to
    lower the risks of production and service interruptions, as well
    as shortages of key parts, by: (1) qualifying and selecting
    alternate suppliers for key parts; (2) monitoring the
    financial condition of key suppliers; (3) maintaining
    appropriate inventories of key parts; and (4) qualifying
    new parts on a timely basis.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s long-term growth strategy requires continued
    development of new products. Applied’s significant
    investment in research, development and engineering (RD&E)
    has generally enabled it to deliver new products and
    technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus
    allowing customers to incorporate these products into their
    manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology
    selection cycle. Applied works closely with its global customers
    to design systems and processes that meet their planned
    technical and production requirements. Product development and
    engineering organizations are located primarily in the United
    States, as well as in Europe and Israel. In addition, Applied
    outsources certain RD&E activities, some of which are
    performed outside the United States. Process support and
    customer demonstration laboratories are located in the United
    States, China, Europe and Israel.

Applied invested $1.1 billion (12 percent of net
    sales) in fiscal 2007, $1.2 billion (13 percent of net
    sales) in fiscal 2006 and $941 million (13 percent of
    net sales) in fiscal 2005 in RD&E for product development
    and engineering programs to create new products and to improve
    existing technologies and products. Applied has spent an average
    of 13 percent of net sales in RD&E over the last five
    years. In addition to RD&E for specific product
    technologies, Applied maintains ongoing programs for automation
    control systems, materials research and environmental control
    that have applications to its products. In fiscal 2007, Applied
    focused on developing systems for customers’ new chip
    designs with 45nm and below geometries, including systems to
    enable faster transistors using strain engineering and high-k
    metal gates, and patterning processes that will enable customers
    to extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through
    additional technology generations.

Marketing
    and Sales

Because of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied
    markets and sells products worldwide through a direct sales
    force. More than 84 percent of Applied’s fiscal
    2007 net sales were to regions outside of the
    United States. Net sales to customers by region as a
    percentage of total net sales were: Taiwan 28 percent,
    Korea 19 percent, North America (primarily the United
    States) 16 percent, Japan 15 percent, Asia-Pacific
    (including China) 12 percent, and Europe 10 percent.



General economic conditions impact Applied’s business and
    financial results. From time to time, the markets in which
    products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may
    negatively impact sales. Applied’s business is usually not
    seasonal in nature, but it is cyclical, based on capital
    equipment investment by major semiconductor, flat panel display
    and other manufacturers. These expenditures depend on many
    factors, including: anticipated market demand and pricing for
    semiconductors, LCDs, solar cells, architectural glass and other
    substrates; the development of new technologies; factory
    utilization; and global and regional economic conditions.

Applied manages its business and reports financial results based
    on the segments described above, but does not allocate certain
    sales and marketing costs to the segments.

Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and
    long-lived assets attributable to Applied’s geographic
    regions is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. accounted
    for 12 percent of Applied’s net sales in fiscal 2007,
    11 percent of Applied’s net sales in fiscal 2006, and
    10 percent of Applied’s net sales in fiscal 2005.
    These net sales were for products in multiple reportable
    segments.

Competition

The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive
    and characterized by rapid technological change. Applied’s
    ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely
    commercialize its technology, continually improve its products
    and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer
    requirements. Significant competitive factors include technical
    capability and differentiation, productivity and
    cost-effectiveness. The importance of these factors varies
    according to customers’ needs, including product mix and
    respective product requirements, applications, and the timing
    and circumstances of purchasing decisions. Substantial
    competition exists in all areas of Applied’s business.
    Competitors range from small companies that compete with a
    single product

and/or

in a
    single region, to global, diversified companies with a range of
    products. Applied’s ability to compete requires a high
    level of investment in RD&E and in marketing, sales and
    customer support activities. Management believes that many of
    Applied’s products have strong competitive positions.

The competitive environment for each segment is described below:

The semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by
    consumer demand for lower-cost electronic products with
    increased capability and, to a lesser extent, by demand for
    commercial applications. As a result, products within the
    Silicon segment are subject to rapid changes in customer
    requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions,
    larger wafer sizes, new materials and an increasing number of
    applications. While certain existing technologies may be adapted
    to new requirements, some applications create the need for an
    entirely different technical approach. The rapid pace of
    technological change can quickly diminish the value of current
    technologies and create opportunities for many existing and new
    competitors. Applied offers a broad portfolio of technically
    differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy
    customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively.
    Applied allocates resources among its many product offerings and
    therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to
    the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products.
    There are many competitors serving the semiconductor
    manufacturing equipment industry, with some offering a single
    product line and others offering multiple product lines. These
    competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to
    global, diversified companies.

Products and services within the Fab Solutions segment are
    characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements and a
    diverse group of numerous competitors. To compete effectively,
    Applied offers products and services to reduce costs, improve
    productivity, and lessen the environmental impact of
    customers’ fab operations. Significant competitive factors
    include productivity, cost-effectiveness, and the level of
    technical service and support. The importance of these factors
    varies according to customers’ needs and the type of
    products or services offered.

Products in the Display segment are subject to strong
    competition from a number of major competitors. Applied holds
    established market positions with its technically differentiated
    LCD manufacturing solutions for the PECVD, color filter (CF)
    sputtering and array testing, although its market position can
    change rapidly if it does not meet customers’ requirements.
    Applied introduced a new array sputtering tool in fiscal 2007.
    As a recent entrant, Applied faces significant competition from
    existing array sputtering suppliers.



Applied’s products within the Adjacent Technologies segment
    compete in diverse market areas, including equipment to make
    solar cells, flexible electronics and energy-efficient glass. In
    solar, Applied offers products for two distinct technologies,
    c-Si wafer-based and thin film (glass) modules. As a recent
    entrant to the solar equipment business, Applied competes with
    many other companies that have more experience with solar
    applications. Applied also is a recent entrant to the flexible
    electronics equipment business, which operates in an emerging
    market sector characterized by diverse types of applications,
    customer requirements and competitors. Applied’s glass
    coating equipment faces significant competition from at least
    one established supplier and another recent market entrant.

Patents
    and Licenses

Management believes that Applied’s competitive position
    significantly depends upon the Company’s research,
    development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing
    capabilities, and not just on its patent position. However,
    protection of Applied’s technological assets by obtaining
    and enforcing intellectual property rights, including patents,
    is important. Therefore, Applied’s practice is to file
    patent applications in the United States and other countries for
    inventions that Applied considers significant. Applied has a
    substantial number of patents in the United States and other
    countries, and additional applications are pending for new
    inventions. Although Applied does not consider its business
    materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Applied
    and the products made and sold under its patents, taken as a
    whole, are a significant element of Applied’s business. In
    addition to patents, Applied also possesses other intellectual
    property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets and
    copyrights.

Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements
    with other companies when management determines that it is in
    its best interest to do so. Applied pays royalties under
    existing patent license agreements for the use, in several of
    its products, of certain patented technologies that are licensed
    to Applied for the life of the patents. Applied also receives
    royalties from licenses granted to third parties. Royalties
    received from or paid to third parties have not been, and are
    not expected to be, material to Applied’s consolidated
    results of operations.

In the normal course of business, Applied periodically receives
    and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In
    dealing with such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful
    for Applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights.
    However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights
    will be available to Applied on commercially reasonable terms,
    or at all. If Applied is not able to resolve or settle claims,
    obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms,

and/or

successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Environmental
    Matters

Two of Applied’s locations have been designated as
    environmental cleanup sites. In 1987, the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency designated one of the locations,
    in Santa Clara, California, as a Superfund site and named
    Applied as a “Responsible Party.” Cleanup activities
    at this site began in 1984 and were substantially completed in
    February 2002. The California Regional Water Quality Control
    Board designated Applied as a “Discharger” with
    respect to another site in Sunnyvale, California. Applied was
    named a Discharger upon its acquisition of the property in 1997
    solely due to its status as property owner. The prior owners of
    the site

and/or

operators who caused the contamination are responsible for
    performing cleanup and monitoring activities.

Applied maintains a number of environmental, health and safety
    programs that are primarily preventive in nature. As part of
    these programs, Applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance
    and periodically conducts investigations of possible
    contamination.

Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating
    the discharge of materials into the environment, remedial
    agreements and other actions relating to the environment have
    not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on
    Applied’s capital expenditures, competitive position,
    financial condition or results of operations.

The most recent report on Applied’s environmental, health
    and safety activities can be found on the Company’s website

    information contained on Applied’s website is part of this
    report or is incorporated by reference herein.



Employees

At October 28, 2007, Applied employed 14,550 regular
    employees and 778 temporary employees. In the high-technology
    industry, competition for highly-skilled employees is intense.
    Applied believes that its future success is highly dependent
    upon its continued ability to attract, retain and motivate
    qualified employees. There can be no assurance that Applied will
    be able to attract, hire, assimilate and retain a sufficient
    number of qualified employees.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

The following factors could materially affect Applied’s
    business, financial condition or results of operations and
    should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its
    business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere
    in this report.

The
    industries that Applied serves are volatile and
    unpredictable.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar and related industries, Applied is subject to business
    cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be
    difficult to predict and which may vary by reportable segment.
    The industries have historically been cyclical due to sudden
    changes in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements
    and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization,
    demand for customers’ products, and inventory levels
    relative to demand. The effects on Applied of these changes in
    demand, including end-customer demand, are occurring more
    rapidly. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of
    customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and
    continue to affect Applied’s orders, net sales, gross
    margin, contributed profit and results of operations.

Applied must effectively manage its resources and production
    capacity to meet rapidly changing demand. During periods of
    decreasing demand Applied’s products, Applied must be able
    to appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market
    conditions, motivate and retain key employees, and effectively
    manage its supply chain. During periods of increasing demand,
    Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and
    inventory to meet customer demand; attract, retain and motivate
    a sufficient number of qualified individuals; and effectively
    manage its supply chain. If Applied is not able to timely and
    appropriately adapt to changes in industry cycles,
    Applied’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the
    semiconductor and

semiconductor-related

industries.

The global industries in which Applied operates are
    characterized by ongoing changes, including: (1) higher
    capital requirements for building and operating new
    semiconductor and LCD fabrication plants and the resulting
    effect on customers’ ability to raise the necessary
    capital; (2) differing rates of market growth for, and
    capital investments by, various semiconductor device makers,
    such as memory (including NAND Flash and DRAM), logic and
    foundry, as well as LCD and solar manufacturers;
    (3) industry growth rates; (4) the increasing cost and
    decreasing affordability of research and development due to many
    factors, including decreasing linewidths, the increasing number
    of materials, applications and process steps, and the greater
    complexity of process development and chip design; (5) the
    increasing difficulty for customers to move from product design
    to volume manufacturing; (6) the importance of reducing the
    cost of system ownership, due in part to the increasing
    significance of consumer electronics as a driver for
    semiconductor and LCD demand and the related focus on lower
    prices; (7) varying levels of business information
    technology spending; (8) the heightened importance to
    customers of system reliability and productivity, and the effect
    on demand for systems as a result of their increasing
    productivity, device yield and reliability; (9) the growing
    types and varieties of semiconductors and expanding number of
    applications across multiple substrate sizes, resulting in
    customers’ divergent technical demands; (10) demand
    for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and
    installation of manufacturing equipment; (11) the challenge
    to semiconductor manufacturers of moving volume manufacturing
    from one technology node to the next smaller technology node,
    and the resulting impact on the technology transition rate and
    the rate of investment in capital equipment; (12) price
    trends for certain semiconductor devices and LCDs;
    (13) difficulties associated with transitioning to larger
    substrate sizes; and (14) the increasing importance of the
    availability of spare parts to assure maximum system uptime. If
    Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor and
    semiconductor-related industries, its business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected.



Applied
    must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to
    competition and rapid technological changes.

As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment, its
    future success depends on many factors, including the effective
    development, commercialization and customer acceptance of its
    nanomanufacturing technology equipment, service and related
    products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its
    growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing
    markets, expanding into related markets, and cultivating new
    markets, while constantly improving its operational performance.
    The development, introduction and support of a broadening set of
    products in more varied competitive environments have grown
    increasingly complex and expensive over time. Applied’s
    success is subject to many risks, including but not limited to
    its ability to timely, cost-effectively and successfully:
    (1) improve

and/or

develop new applications for existing products, adapt similar
    products for use by customers in different applications

and/or

markets with varying technical requirements, and develop new
    products; (2) appropriately price and achieve market
    acceptance of products; (3) maintain operating flexibility
    to enable different responses to different markets, customers
    and applications; (4) appropriately allocate resources,
    including RD&E funding, among Applied’s products and
    between the development of new products and the improvement of
    existing products; (5) accurately forecast demand and meet
    production schedules for its products; (6) achieve cost
    efficiencies across product offerings; (7) increase market
    share in existing markets, expand its markets and exceed the
    industry growth rate; (8) adapt to technology changes in
    related markets, such as lithography; (9) adapt to changes
    in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply
    chain; (10) qualify products for volume manufacturing with
    its customers; (11) implement changes in its design
    engineering methodology, including those that enable significant
    decreases in material costs and cycle time, greater commonality
    of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and
    greater effectiveness of product life cycle management; and
    (12) improve its manufacturing processes. Furthermore, new
    or improved products may involve higher costs and reduced
    margins. If Applied does not successfully manage these
    challenges, its business, financial condition and results of
    operations could be materially and adversely affected.

The
    entry into new markets and industries entails additional
    challenges.

As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand
    into related or new markets and industries, either with its
    existing nanomanufacturing technology products or with new
    products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions.
    These include the emerging solar market, which Applied entered
    in 2006 and which is subject to ongoing changes in demand for
    photovoltaic (PV) products arising from, among other things,
    fluctuations in the cost of electric power, availability of
    government incentives, changes in government energy policies,
    the performance and reliability of PV technology, and the
    success of other renewable energy sources. The entry into
    different markets involves additional challenges, including
    those arising from: (1) Applied’s ability to
    anticipate demand and capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or
    minimize risks; (2) new customers and suppliers, including
    some with limited operating histories, uncertain

and/or

limited funding,

and/or

locations in regions where Applied does not have existing
    operations; (3) the adoption of new business models, such
    as the supply of a suite of Applied and non-Applied equipment
    sufficient to manufacture solar cells; (4) difficulties in
    production planning and execution; (5) new materials,
    processes and technologies; (6) Applied’s ability to
    drive efficiencies and cost reductions; (7) the need to
    attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise
    in these new areas; (8) different service requirements; and
    (9) intellectual property rights of others. If Applied does
    not successfully manage the risks resulting from entry into new
    markets and industries, its business, financial condition and
    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to the risks of operating a global
    business.

In fiscal 2007, approximately 84 percent of Applied’s
    net sales were to customers in regions outside the
    United States. A rising percentage of Applied’s
    business is from customers in Asia. Certain of Applied’s
    RD&E

and/or

manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are
    also located outside the United States, including in China.
    Managing Applied’s global operations presents challenges,
    including but not limited to, those arising from:
    (1) global uncertainties with respect to economic growth
    rates in various countries; (2) varying regional and
    geopolitical business conditions and demands; (3) global
    trade issues; (4) variations in protection of intellectual
    property and other legal rights in different countries;
    (5) concerns of U.S. governmental agencies regarding
    possible



national commercial

and/or

security issues posed by the growing manufacturing business in
    Asia; (6) fluctuating raw material and energy costs;
    (7) variations in the ability to develop relationships with
    suppliers and other local businesses; (8) changes in laws
    and regulations of the United States (including export
    restrictions) and other countries, as well as their
    interpretation and application; (9) fluctuations in
    interest rates and currency exchange rates, including the
    weakening relative position of the U.S. dollar;
    (10) the need to provide sufficient levels of technical
    support in different locations; (11) political instability,
    natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or storms),
    pandemics, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied
    has operations, suppliers or sales; (12) cultural
    differences; (13) special customer- or government-supported
    efforts to promote the development and growth of local
    competitors; (14) shipping costs

and/or

delays; and (15) adverse conditions in credit markets. Many
    of these challenges are present in China, which is experiencing
    significant growth of both suppliers and competitors to Applied,
    and which Applied believes presents a large potential market for
    its products and opportunity for growth over the long term. In
    addition, Applied must regularly reassess the size, capability
    and location of its global infrastructure and make appropriate
    changes. These challenges may materially and adversely affect
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated
    customer base in the semiconductor and flat panel display
    industries.

Applied’s semiconductor and flat panel display customer
    base historically has been, and is becoming even more, highly
    concentrated. Orders from a relatively limited number of
    manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue
    to account for, a substantial portion of Applied’s net
    sales. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales to
    any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders,
    or they delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to
    replace the business. As Applied’s products are configured
    to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling
    orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major
    customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing,
    payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial
    terms that are less favorable to Applied. In addition, certain
    customers have undergone significant ownership changes, have
    outsourced manufacturing activities,

and/or

have
    entered into strategic alliances or industry consortia that have
    increased the influence of key semiconductor manufacturers in
    technology decisions made by their partners, which may result in
    additional complexities in managing customer relationships and
    transactions. These factors could have a material, adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic
    investments.

Applied has made, and in the future intends to make,
    acquisitions of, and investments in, companies, technologies or
    products in existing, related or new markets for Applied.
    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited
    to: (1) diversion of management’s attention from other
    operational matters; (2) inability to complete acquisitions
    as anticipated or at all; (3) inability to realize
    anticipated benefits; (4) failure to commercialize
    purchased technologies; (5) inability to capitalize on
    characteristics of new markets that may be significantly
    different from Applied’s existing markets;
    (6) exposure to operational risks, rules and regulations to
    the extent such activities are located in countries where
    Applied has not historically done business; (7) inability
    to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key
    technologies; (8) ineffectiveness of an acquired
    company’s internal controls; (9) impairment of
    acquired intangible assets as a result of technological
    advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired
    company or its product offerings; (10) unknown,
    underestimated

and/or

undisclosed commitments or liabilities; (11) excess or
    underutilized facilities; and (12) ineffective integration
    of operations, technologies, products or employees of the
    acquired companies. Applied also makes strategic investments in
    other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures,
    which may decline in value

and/or

not
    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments
    depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited
    or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures,
    requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic
    partners. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are
    inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to
    effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely
    affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results
    of operations.



Manufacturing
    interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to
    meet customer demand, while the failure to estimate customer
    demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete
    inventory.

Applied’s business depends on its ability to supply
    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly
    changing technical and volume requirements of its customers,
    which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts,
    components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from
    suppliers. Some key parts may be subject to long lead-times

and/or

obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of
    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by
    suppliers in developing regions, including China. Significant
    interruptions of manufacturing operations or the delivery of
    services as a result of: (1) the failure or inability of
    suppliers to timely deliver quality parts; (2) volatility
    in the availability and cost of materials; (3) difficulties
    or delays in obtaining required export approvals;
    (4) information technology or infrastructure failures;
    (5) natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or
    storms); or (6) other causes (such as regional economic
    downturns, pandemics, political instability, terrorism, or acts
    of war), could result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing
    inefficiencies, increased costs or order cancellations.
    Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is
    different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts
    than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or
    expediting delivery of parts. Any or all of these factors could
    materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

The
    failure to successfully implement and conduct offshoring and
    outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could
    adversely affect results of operations.

To better align its costs with market conditions, increase its
    presence in growing markets, improve its tax structure, and
    enhance productivity and operational efficiency, Applied
    conducts engineering, software development and other operations
    in regions outside the United States, particularly India and
    China, and outsources certain functions to third parties,
    including companies in the United States, India, China and other
    countries. Outsourced functions include certain engineering,
    manufacturing, customer support, software development,
    information technology support and administrative activities.
    The expanding role of third party providers has required changes
    to Applied’s existing operations and the adoption of new
    procedures and processes for retaining and managing these
    providers in order to realize the potential productivity and
    operational efficiencies, assure quality and protect
    Applied’s intellectual property. In addition, Applied has
    implemented several key, operational initiatives intended to
    improve manufacturing efficiency, including integrate-to-order,
    module-final-test and

merge-in-transit

programs. Applied also is implementing a multi-year,
    company-wide program to transform certain business processes,
    which includes transitioning to a single-vendor, enterprise
    resource planning (ERP) software system to perform various
    functions. If Applied does not effectively develop and implement
    its offshoring and outsourcing strategies, if required export
    and other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if
    Applied’s third party providers do not perform as
    anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in
    implementing a new ERP system or enhancing business processes,
    Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or
    cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties,
    increased costs, manufacturing interruptions or delays, loss of
    its intellectual property rights, quality issues, increased
    product time-to-market

and/or

inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which
    could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

The
    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital
    to Applied’s success.

Applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part
    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.
    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,
    including fluctuations in global economic and industry
    conditions, changes in Applied’s management or leadership,
    competitors’ hiring practices, and the effectiveness of
    Applied’s compensation programs, including its equity-based
    programs. Applied regularly evaluates its overall compensation
    program and makes adjustments, as appropriate, to enhance its
    competitiveness. If Applied does not successfully attract,
    retain and motivate key employees, Applied’s ability to
    capitalize on its opportunities and its operating results may be
    materially and adversely affected.



Changes
    in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results of
    operations.

As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the
    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment
    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
    Applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be
    affected by numerous factors, including changes in the:
    (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings
    in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) valuation of
    Applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition,
    Applied is subject to regular examination of its income tax
    returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
    authorities. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of
    favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these
    examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for
    income taxes. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are
    reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final
    determination will not be materially different from the
    treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax
    provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely
    affect Applied’s results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or
    claims and protection of intellectual property
    rights.

Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved
    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,
    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental
    regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product
    liability, unfair competition, employment and other matters. In
    addition, Applied on occasion receives notification from
    customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or
    other obligations related to claims made against customers by
    third parties. These legal proceedings and claims, whether with
    or without merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to
    prosecute or defend and also divert management’s attention
    and resources. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome
    of current or future legal proceedings or claims. Applied
    previously entered into a mutual covenant-not-to-sue arrangement
    with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent
    infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be no assurance
    that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved
    or that Applied will be able to adequately protect its
    intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated
    with such a covenant. In addition, Applied’s success
    depends in significant part on the protection of its
    intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of
    Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized
    manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in
    uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied.
    Applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide
    significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented,
    invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of
    technological change, or if Applied does not adequately assert
    these rights. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other
    countries, including China, Taiwan and Korea, permit the
    protection and enforcement of Applied’s rights to varying
    extents, which may not be sufficient to protect Applied’s
    rights. If Applied is not able to obtain or enforce intellectual
    property rights, resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary
    licenses on commercially reasonable terms,

and/or

successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and
    safety regulations.

Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in
    connection with its global business operations, including but
    not limited to: regulations related to the development,
    manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of
    materials used in its products; the operation of its facilities;
    and the use of its real property. The failure or inability to
    comply with existing or future environmental and safety
    regulations could result in: (1) significant remediation
    liabilities; (2) the imposition of fines; (3) the
    suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale
    or use of certain of its products; (4) limitations on the
    operation of its facilities or ability to use its real property;

and/or

(5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of
    which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory
    environment.

Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,
    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and
    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies

and/or

regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates;
    (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional
    regulatory agencies related to international trade; and
    (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and
    regulations. If Applied is found by a court or



regulatory agency not to be in compliance with applicable laws,
    rules or regulations, Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected.

Applied
    is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
    Applied must include in its Annual Report on

Form 10-K

a report of management on the effectiveness of Applied’s
    internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance
    with this requirement is complex, costly and time-consuming. If:
    (1) Applied fails to maintain effective internal control
    over financial reporting; (2) Applied’s management
    does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal control; or
    (3) Applied’s independent registered public accounting
    firm does not timely deliver an unqualified opinion as to the
    effectiveness of Applied’s internal controls, Applied could
    be subject to regulatory sanctions and the public’s
    perception of Applied may decline.

Overview

Applied provides Nanomanufacturing Technology solutions for the
    global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related
    industries, with a broad portfolio of innovative equipment,
    service and software products. Applied’s customers include
    manufacturers of semiconductor chips and wafers, liquid crystal
    displays (LCDs), solar photovoltaic (PV) cells, flexible
    electronics and energy-efficient glass. Applied reports four
    segments: Silicon, Fab Solutions, Display, and Adjacent
    Technologies. Product development and manufacturing activities
    occur in North America, Europe, Israel and Asia. Applied’s
    broad range of equipment and service products are highly
    technical and are sold through a direct sales force.

As a supplier to these industries, Applied’s results are
    driven primarily by worldwide demand for integrated circuits,
    which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic
    products. Applied’s business is subject to cyclical
    industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and
    services can change depending on supply and demand for chips,
    LCDs and other electronic devices, as well as other factors,
    such as global economic conditions and technological advances in
    fabrication processes.

The following table presents certain significant measurements
    for the past three fiscal years:

Fiscal 2007 financial results reflected improved conditions in
    the semiconductor industry that began with the industry’s
    recovery in 2006, while conditions in the display industry were
    mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite
    strong consumer demand for LCD TVs. Total orders decreased
    slightly from fiscal 2006, primarily due to the significant
    decline in demand for display manufacturing products, partially
    offset by increased demand for products and services in all
    other segments. Net sales increased during fiscal 2007 over
    fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong demand from DRAM and Flash
    memory chip manufacturers, partially offset by a significant
    decline in LCD equipment sales as manufacturers absorbed
    capacity following substantial growth in 2006. Net income
    improved in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 due to higher
    sales and lower operating expenses, offset in



part by lower interest income. Fiscal 2007 financial results
    included equity-based compensation expenses, restructuring and
    asset impairment and other charges associated with ceasing
    development of beamline implant products, and an in-process
    research and development (IPR&D) expense associated with
    the acquisition of certain net assets of Brooks Automation, Inc.
    (Brooks Software).

In fiscal 2006, customer demand improved over fiscal 2005,
    resulting in higher orders and revenue. Fiscal 2006 results
    reflected a recovery in the semiconductor and flat panel display
    industries and the global economy, as end-user demand for
    electronic products and LCDs drove increased customer
    investments in advanced silicon (particularly memory) and
    display products. During this period, Applied’s
    semiconductor customers increased both high-volume production
    and leading-edge 65nm and 45nm chip development. Improvements in
    operating performance were offset in part by restructuring and
    asset impairment charges associated with real estate and
    facilities disinvestment, equity-based compensation expenses,
    and an IPR&D expense associated with the acquisition of
    Applied Films Corporation (Applied Films).

Fiscal 2005 financial results reflected a challenging
    environment as Applied’s customers decreased fab
    utilization globally and reduced or delayed capital expenditures
    as a result of excess inventories and slowing demand for chips.
    In this period, Applied focused on lowering costs, improving
    efficiencies, reducing cycle time and bringing new products to
    market.

Applied expects a challenging environment for the first part of
    fiscal 2008. Uncertain economic conditions, including higher
    energy prices, credit concerns and changes in consumer
    confidence, have led to reduced demand in the semiconductor
    equipment industry. As a result, semiconductor equipment
    customers are expected to invest at levels lower than in 2007,
    offset in part by the anticipated onset of a recovery in the
    flat panel display industry and growth in other markets.

Applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry
    conditions in fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007. As a result of these
    conditions, there were significant fluctuations in
    Applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales, both within
    and



across the fiscal years. Demand for manufacturing equipment has
    historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in chip
    and LCD supply and demand and other factors, including rapid
    technological advances in fabrication processes.

New
    Orders

New orders by geographic region, which were attributed to the
    location of customers’ facilities, were as follows:

New orders for fiscal 2007 decreased 2 percent to
    $9.7 billion from $9.9 billion in the prior year,
    reflecting delays in investment by LCD customers, partially
    offset by increased demand for solar equipment, semiconductor
    manufacturing equipment, and service products. Demand for
    semiconductor equipment slowed in the second half of fiscal 2007
    as customers absorbed added capacity. LCD customers increased
    spending levels in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.

New orders for fiscal 2006 increased 55 percent to
    $9.9 billion from $6.4 billion in the prior year, as
    customer demand increased. Fiscal 2006 orders reflected
    increased semiconductor manufacturing equipment orders from
    memory manufacturers, increased service orders as a result of
    higher customer factory utilization and new product
    introductions, and increased display orders as customers
    invested in next generation equipment. New orders for fiscal
    2005 decreased to $6.4 billion reflecting a challenging
    environment, as semiconductor manufacturers reduced their
    capital investments to align inventories with demand.

Applied’s backlog for the last three fiscal years was as
    follows: $3.7 billion at October 28, 2007,
    $3.4 billion at October 29, 2006, and
    $2.6 billion at October 30, 2005. Backlog consists
    only of orders for which written authorizations have been
    accepted, shipment dates within 12 months have been
    assigned and revenue has not been recognized. Due to the
    potential for customer changes in delivery schedules or
    cancellation of orders, Applied’s backlog at any particular
    time is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any
    future periods.

During fiscal 2007, net sales increased by 6 percent, from
    $9.2 billion in fiscal 2006 to $9.7 billion in fiscal
    2007, led by strength in memory capacity expansion throughout
    the year. In fiscal 2006, following the trend of increasing
    orders that year, net sales increased by 31 percent, from
    $7.0 billion in fiscal 2005 to $9.2 billion in fiscal
    2006. In fiscal 2005, net sales of $7.0 billion reflected
    lower demand for semiconductor products.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to
    46.1 percent in fiscal 2007 from 46.8 percent in
    fiscal 2006, which was an increase from 44.1 percent in
    fiscal 2005. The decrease in the gross margin percentage from
    fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was principally attributable to
    inventory-related charges of $56 million associated with
    ceasing development of beamline implant products, incremental
    charges attributable to acquisitions consisting of inventory
    fair value adjustments on products sold, amortization, and
    product mix, partially offset by higher revenue levels and lower
    material costs. Gross margin during fiscal 2006 and 2007
    included $37 million and $27 million, respectively, of
    equity-based compensation expense. The increase in the gross
    margin percentage from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was
    principally attributable to the combination of higher revenue
    levels, decreased product costs and increased manufacturing
    volume and absorption, partially offset by increased variable
    and equity-based compensation costs. Applied began recognizing
    expenses associated with stock options and the ESPP in fiscal
    2006.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable
    extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the
    products and services it provides. Applied believes that it is
    critical to continue to make substantial investments in
    RD&E to assure the availability of innovative technology
    that meets the current and projected requirements of its
    customers’ most advanced designs. Applied has historically
    maintained its commitment to investing in RD&E in order to
    continue to offer new products and technologies. RD&E
    expenses were $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales)
    in fiscal 2007, $1.2 billion (13 percent of net sales)
    in fiscal 2006, and $941 million (13 percent of net
    sales) in fiscal 2005. RD&E expense during fiscal 2006 and
    2007 included $76 million and $56 million,
    respectively, of equity-based compensation expense. Development
    cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the
    product is an enhancement of an existing product, which
    typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product,
    which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of
    Applied’s existing products resulted from internal
    development activities and innovations involving new
    technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances,
    Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product
    areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to
    reduce time to market.

In fiscal 2007, Applied focused on developing systems for
    customers’ new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries,
    including systems to enable faster transistors using strain
    engineering and high-k metal gates, and



patterning processes that will enable customers to extend their
    existing 193 nm lithography tools through additional technology
    generations. Applied also continued to invest in solar research
    and development.

In fiscal 2006, Applied continued its development of systems to
    increase chip performance, especially for Flash and DRAM
    devices. Applied also focused on developing systems for 32nm and
    22nm copper/low k interconnect processing technologies to
    address critical manufacturing challenges that chipmakers face
    as they transition to future device generations, helping them to
    bring new products to market more rapidly while minimizing risk.
    Applied also continued to focus on developing LCD systems to
    process larger glass substrates.

In fiscal 2005, Applied focused on developing systems for
    customers’ advanced chip designs, including systems to
    enable smaller and faster interconnect and transistor structures
    with 65nm, 45nm and below geometries, and LCD systems to process
    larger glass substrates.

During fiscal 2007, Applied recorded an IPR&D expense of
    $5 million associated with the acquisition of certain net
    assets of Brooks Software. During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded
    an IPR&D expense in the amount of $14 million related
    to the acquisition of Applied Films. Applied’s methodology
    for allocating the purchase price relating to purchased
    acquisitions to IPR&D was determined through established
    valuation techniques. The IPR&D was expensed upon
    acquisition because technological feasibility had not been
    established and no future alternative uses existed. No
    IPR&D charges were recorded in fiscal 2005.

Marketing,
    Selling, General and Administrative

Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $952 million (10 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2007,
    $907 million (10 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2006,
    and $697 million (10 percent of net sales) in fiscal
    2005. The increase in marketing, selling, general and
    administrative expenses from fiscal 2006 to 2007 was principally
    attributable to increased operating costs from acquired
    businesses, investments in the solar business expansion, and
    increased variable compensation expenses. These expenses were
    partially offset by lower equity compensation expenses and
    savings from cost control initiatives, including ceasing
    development of beamline implant products and transitioning to
    managed service providers to perform certain information
    technology and business infrastructure support. Marketing, sales
    and general and administrative expenses during fiscal 2006 and
    2007 included $104 million and $77 million,
    respectively, of equity-based compensation expense. The increase
    from fiscal 2005 to 2006 correlated to the increase in business
    volume, as well as increases in variable compensation as a
    result of improved operating performance, equity-based
    compensation expense, and early spending on Applied’s
    implementation of an enterprise resource planning software
    system, partially offset by savings resulting from
    Applied’s continued focus on controlling its overall cost
    structure.

Restructuring
    and Asset Impairments

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied’s Board of
    Directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of
    Applied’s real estate and facilities portfolio (the
    Disinvestment Plan). Properties with an estimated fair value of
    $56 million were reported as assets held-for-sale and
    reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded
    an asset impairment charge of $124 million to write down
    the following properties to estimated fair value:
    (1) facilities in Narita, Japan, Chunan, Korea, Hillsboro,
    Oregon, and Danvers, Massachusetts; and (2) 26 acres
    of unimproved land in Hillsboro, Oregon. During fiscal 2006,
    Applied sold the Danvers facility for net proceeds of
    $16 million and recognized a gain of $4 million.
    During fiscal 2007, Applied sold the Hillsboro, Chunan, and
    Narita facilities and the Hillsboro land for total net proceeds
    of $38 million and recognized a gain of $3 million.
    Also in fiscal 2006, as part of the Disinvestment Plan, Applied
    recorded lease termination charges in the amount of
    $89 million related to the closure of its leased Hayward,
    California facility.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, Applied’s Board
    of Directors approved a plan (the Plan) to cease development of
    beamline implant products for semiconductor manufacturing and
    curtail the operations of its Implant group based in Horsham,
    England. Pursuant to the Plan, Applied closed its research,
    development and manufacturing operations in Horsham in October
    2007. The total cost of implementing the Plan is expected to be
    in the range of $95 million to $110 million, and is
    reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under cost
    of



products sold and operating expenses (including restructuring
    and asset impairment charges). The majority of the cash outlays
    in connection with the Plan occurred in fiscal 2007.

Costs under the Plan in fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of
    inventory-related charges reported as cost of products sold of
    $56 million, other operating expenses of $10 million,
    and restructuring and asset impairment charges of
    $30 million. Also as part of the Plan, Applied recorded
    restructuring charges of $22 million, consisting primarily
    of employee termination costs to reduce its workforce by
    approximately 215 positions. The majority of the affected
    employees were based in Horsham, England, and represented
    multiple functions. Asset impairment charges included
    $8 million of fixed asset write-offs. The Implant group
    operated in the Silicon segment, and the results of its
    operations were not material to Applied’s financial
    position or results of operations.

For further details, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Net
    Interest Income

Net interest income was $98 million for fiscal 2007,
    $149 million for fiscal 2006, and $134 million for
    fiscal 2005.

The decrease in net interest income from fiscal 2006 to 2007 was
    primarily due to a reduction in cash and investments during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, when Applied repurchased
    145 million shares of outstanding common stock for an
    aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion under an
    accelerated stock buyback program. On January 24, 2007,
    Applied settled the price adjustment of $132 million
    relating to the accelerated stock buyback program by payment in
    cash to Goldman Sachs & Co. (Goldman Sachs), resulting
    in an adjusted price per share of $18.08. The repurchase was
    funded with Applied’s existing cash and investments. A
    portion of the investment portfolio was sold to fund the
    accelerated stock buyback, resulting in lower interest income in
    2007.

The increase in net interest income from fiscal 2005 to 2006 was
    due primarily to increased interest rates combined with a
    decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt
    maturities in September 2004 and September 2005.

Income
    Taxes

Applied’s effective income tax provision rate was
    29.9 percent for fiscal 2007, 30.0 percent for fiscal
    2006, and 23.5 percent for fiscal 2005. Applied’s
    effective tax rate of 29.9 percent for fiscal 2007
    reflected benefits of $36 million principally related to
    the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income
    tax filings, partially offset by a $13 million charge from
    the expensing of equity-based compensation. Applied’s
    effective tax rate of 30.0 percent for fiscal 2006
    reflected benefits of $61 million principally related to
    the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income
    tax filings, partially offset by a $17 million charge from
    the expensing of equity-based compensation. Applied’s
    effective rate of 23.5 percent for fiscal 2005 reflected
    the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income
    tax filings of $118 million and a change in estimate with
    respect to export tax benefits of $14 million, partially
    offset by a charge of $32 million relating to the
    distribution of foreign earnings under the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act).

Applied’s future effective income tax rate depends on
    various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic
    composition of Applied’s pre-tax income, and non-tax
    deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions.
    Management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts
    the effective income tax rate accordingly.

Segment
    Information

After the acquisition of Applied Films, Applied made certain
    changes to its internal financial reporting structure during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and, as a result, operates in four
    reportable segments: Silicon, Fab Solutions, Display, and
    Adjacent Technologies. A description of the products and
    services, as well as financial data, for each reportable segment
    can be found in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Future changes to Applied’s internal financial
    reporting structure may result in changes to the reportable
    segments disclosed. Applied does not allocate to its reportable
    segments certain operating expenses, which it manages separately
    at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include
    equity-based compensation and certain components of variable
    compensation, corporate marketing and sales, corporate functions
    (certain management, finance, legal, human resources and
    RD&E), and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy
    costs. Prior to the fourth quarter of



fiscal 2006, Applied operated in one reportable segment.
    Discussions below include the results of each reportable segment.

Silicon
    Segment

The Silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for
    etch, rapid thermal processing (RTP), deposition, chemical
    mechanical planarization (CMP), and metrology and inspection.
    Development efforts are focused on solving customers’ key
    technical challenges, including transistor performance and
    nanoscale patterning, and on reducing chip manufacturing costs.
    A significant portion of fiscal 2007 demand was attributable to
    a growing market for consumer products with greater memory
    content.

Silicon orders of $6.7 billion increased 1 percent in
    fiscal 2007, compared to $6.6 billion in fiscal 2006,
    reflecting the semiconductor industry’s strength during
    this period, driven by demand for cell phones, digital TVs, game
    consoles, MP3 players and other electronic products. The
    majority of new orders were for memory applications as customers
    invested in leading-edge Flash and DRAM memory devices, while
    orders from foundries remained at low levels. Net sales
    increased 9 percent to $6.5 billion in fiscal 2007,
    compared to $6.0 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase in
    net sales was due to increased investment by memory and logic
    semiconductor customers in multiple areas, including etch,
    inspection, and RTP products. Operating income increased
    19 percent to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2007, compared to
    $2.0 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase in operating
    income was due to higher revenue levels and continued focus on
    cost controls. Operating income for fiscal 2007 included charges
    of $66 million related to ceasing development of beamline
    implant products. In fiscal 2006, the Company launched the
    Applied Producer GT, a significant redesign of its successful
    Producer platform that offers faster, more cost-effective CVD
    processing for 45 nm and beyond applications. To meet the
    challenges of fabricating next-generation transistors, Applied
    announced its portfolio of high-k/metal gate solutions,
    including the Applied Advanced Gate Stack and Applied Centura
    Carina Etch systems. Other new etch systems introduced were the
    Applied Mariana Trench, for etching high aspect ratio
    structures, the Applied Opus AdvantEdge Metal Etch with a new
    5-chamber platform, and the Applied Centura Tetra III
    Advanced Reticle Etch. The Company also added to its line of
    lithography-enabling systems with the new Applied Producer ACE
    SACVD and added to its line of strain engineering solutions with
    the Applied Producer Celera CVD.

In fiscal 2006, Silicon orders of $6.6 billion increased
    67 percent compared to fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006,
    leading semiconductor manufacturers reported increased sales as
    the electronics market continued to grow. The demand for
    consumer electronics, including broadband, personal computers
    and cell phones with increasing digital content and complex
    chips, resulted in increased chip demand and the need for
    additional capacity. In addition to expanding consumer
    electronics demand, corporate information technology investment
    increased, with an emphasis on security, server consolidation
    and more robust internet infrastructures. Net sales of
    $6.0 billion increased 34 percent in fiscal 2006
    compared to fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, demand increased in
    many areas, including etch, inspection and thin films products.
    Operating income of $2.0 billion increased 81 percent
    in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. Improved operating
    results in fiscal 2006 reflected an increase in business volume,
    offset in part by increases in variable compensation expenses.
    In fiscal 2006, Applied continued its development of systems to
    increase chip performance, especially for Flash and DRAM
    devices. To extend the usefulness of aluminum (the material used
    by many memory manufacturers for interconnects) to the sub-70nm
    node, the Company introduced two products, the Applied Endura
    CVD Al technology and Applied Centura AdvantEdge Metal Etch
    system. For faster copper interconnects, Applied launched its
    enhanced Endura CuBS/S II system with Aktiv Preclean, extending
    the system’s capability to the 45nm node and below,
    especially for use with ultra-low dielectric constant (low
    k) films. The Company introduced the Applied Endura iLB II
    (integrated liner-barrier) system, offering advances in PVD
    titanium and preclean technologies, to provide significantly
    reduced resistance for contact structures. The Company also
    focused on providing solutions to extend customers’
    lithography technology, introducing the Applied Producer APF-e
    (advanced patterning film enhancement) system. The new



APF-e film enables chipmakers to cost-effectively pattern
    nano-scale features without additional integration complexity
    while reducing their reliance on next-generation lithography
    systems.

In fiscal 2005, Silicon orders of $3.9 billion and net
    sales of $4.5 billion reflected lower semiconductor capital
    equipment investment. During the year, customers decreased
    manufacturing utilization to address rising chip inventory and
    softening end-user demand. Operating income of $1.1 billion
    reflected Applied’s reduction in variable expenses and cost
    of products sold in order to align its cost structure with
    market conditions. In fiscal 2005, RD&E focused on
    developing systems for customers’ advanced chip designs,
    including systems to enable smaller and faster interconnect and
    transistor structures with 65nm, 45nm and below geometries. For
    copper interconnect applications, the Company introduced the
    Applied Endura CuB/S II system with advanced copper barrier/seed
    technology and the Applied Producer Black Diamond II system
    for next-generation low k dielectric film layers. For
    leading-edge transistor gate applications, the Company launched
    the Applied Centura AdvantEdge Etch system, Applied
    Siconi

tm

preclean technology and the Applied Vantage RadOx RTP. New
    applications in strain engineering, which involves creating
    localized areas of stress in the transistor structure, were also
    developed for existing systems to meet customers’
    requirements for faster transistors. In the area of inspection
    and metrology, the Company launched the Applied
    UVision

tm

system, the industry’s first laser 3D brightfield
    inspection tool, and Applied OPC Check software, designed to
    automate critical OPC mask verification.

Fab
    Solutions Segment

The Fab Solutions segment includes products to improve the
    productivity and operating efficiency and lessen the
    environmental impact of customers’ factories, and includes
    spares and remanufactured equipment sales. Customer demand for
    spare parts and services is fulfilled through a global
    distribution system with trained service engineers located in
    close proximity to customer sites. This business is focused on
    expanding with technically-differentiated new products that
    improve fab productivity, reduce fab operation costs, and enable
    customers to decrease the environmental impact of manufacturing.

Orders of $2.4 billion increased 5 percent in fiscal
    2007, compared to $2.3 billion in fiscal 2006. The increase
    in orders reflected increased demand for spare parts and
    services, as well as demand for factory automation products
    obtained as part of the Brooks Software acquisition. Net sales
    of $2.2 billion in fiscal 2007 were slightly down compared
    to fiscal 2006 and reflected declines in spares parts sales,
    offset by increased factory automation sales. Fiscal 2007
    remanufactured equipment orders and net sales remained
    consistent with fiscal 2006 levels. Operating income decreased
    8 percent to $572 million in fiscal 2007, compared to
    $623 million in fiscal 2006, reflecting product mix and
    increased operating expenses and charges related to the Brooks
    Software acquisition.

In fiscal 2006, orders of $2.3 billion increased
    32 percent compared to fiscal 2005. Net sales of
    $2.2 billion increased 25 percent compared to fiscal
    2005. Net sales reflected increases in spare parts shipments and
    service contracts as a result of higher wafer starts and an
    increase in 200mm remanufactured equipment investment. Operating
    income of $623 million increased 56 percent in 2006
    compared to 2005. During fiscal 2006, operating results
    reflected improved operational efficiencies and savings from
    cost control initiatives. Applied also expanded its product
    offerings with the introduction of abatement systems for
    reducing perfluorocompound (PFC) emissions and additional
    chamber performance services capabilities.

Fiscal 2005 orders of $1.7 billion reflected
    customers’ cost reduction initiatives and lower
    remanufactured systems orders, offset in part by a modest
    increase in wafer starts. Fiscal 2005 net sales were
    $1.8 billion and operating income was $400 million.
    Applied expanded its product portfolio with the addition of
    abatement systems, FAB300 manufacturing execution systems,
    products for assembly and test, kitting and cleaning, and other
    technology-focused fab offerings.



Display
    Segment

The Display segment encompasses products and services for
    manufacturing LCDs for TVs, personal computers and other
    video-enabled devices. Applied is focused on expanding market
    share by differentiation with larger-scale substrates, entry

Orders decreased 61 percent to $407 million in fiscal
    2007, compared to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2006, reflecting
    continued delays in capacity expansion plans by LCD panel makers
    in light of excess inventories and sales price declines. LCD
    customers increased spending levels in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007 as panel makers began to experience more favorable
    market conditions. Net sales decreased 11 percent to
    $862 million in fiscal 2007 from $1.0 billion in
    fiscal 2006. The decrease in net sales was attributable to lower
    investment by LCD manufacturers as they absorbed capacity.
    Operating income decreased 32 percent to $217 million
    in fiscal 2007, compared to $319 million in fiscal 2006,
    due to lower revenues and factory absorption, product mix and
    higher operating expenses in support of the expanded product
    portfolio resulting from the acquisition of Applied Films in
    July 2006. In 2007, Applied launched the
    AKT-PiVot

tm

55KV system which employs high-productivity, cost-efficient PVD
    technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide
    films on the substrate.

In fiscal 2006, orders of $1.0 billion increased
    37 percent compared to fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006,
    price reductions in consumer electronics accelerated the growth
    of the flat panel display market. As a result, display
    manufacturers increased investments in Gen-7, Gen-7.5, and Gen-8
    systems. In addition, laptop demand continued to be strong,
    resulting in additional Gen-5 and Gen-5.5 fab investment. With
    the acquisition of Applied Films in fiscal 2006, Applied entered
    the PVD color filter market. Net sales of $1.0 billion
    increased 28 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. During the
    last quarter of fiscal 2006, flat panel equipment demand began
    to slow as customers aligned their capacity plans and inventory
    levels. Operating income of $319 million increased
    25 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Fiscal 2006 results
    included a $5 million IPR&D expense related to the
    acquisition of Applied Films. Applied launched three FPD
    systems, the AKT-55K EBT, the AKT-55K PECVD and the AKT-NEW
    ARISTO 2200, for manufacturing Gen-8.5 panels, sized at 2.2m x
    2.5m, which produce up to six

55-inch

LCD
    TV screens.

Fiscal 2005 orders of $758 million reflected lower demand
    for smaller panel equipment, offset in part by orders for
    Gen-7.5 systems as manufacturers migrated to larger-sized flat
    panel display production. Net sales and operating income
    increased to $756 million and $254 million,
    respectively. Fiscal 2005 results included higher RD&E
    expenses. Applied introduced the Gen-8 AKT-50K PECVD system for
    manufacturing LCDs. This system processes 2.2m x 2.4m glass
    substrates for producing up to six

52-inch

LCD
    TV screens.

Adjacent
    Technologies

The Adjacent Technologies segment includes products and services
    for manufacturing solar cells, high throughput roll-to-roll
    coating systems for flexible electronics, and energy-efficient
    glass. Applied began offering these products after the
    acquisition of Applied Films in the third quarter of fiscal
    2006. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, Applied acquired HCT
    Shaping Systems SA (HCT), expanding its solar product offerings.
    Activities in this segment are focused on delivering solutions
    to generate and conserve energy, with the objective to lower the
    cost to produce solar electricity by providing equipment and
    services to enhance manufacturing scale and efficiency.

    orders of c-Si solar, glass and flexible electronics products.
    Net sales of $165 million in fiscal 2007 increased from
    $20 million in fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher glass,
    flexible electronics and solar net sales. Operating loss of
    $89 million in fiscal 2007 increased from $8 million
    in fiscal 2006 reflecting increased RD&E spending to
    develop products and services that enable lower-cost production
    of solar energy and costs related to expansion of solar
    marketing efforts, offset by higher revenues. In fiscal 2007,
    Applied introduced the Applied SunFab Thin Film Line, the first
    integrated production line designed for manufacturing thin film
    silicon solar modules using 5.7 square meter glass panels.

Orders and net sales in fiscal 2006 reflected the results of
    Applied Films’ solar, flexible electronics and
    energy-efficient glass products that Applied acquired in the
    third quarter. Fiscal 2006 results included a $9 million
    IPR&D expense related to the acquisition of Applied Films.

    Financial Statements.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including
    an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”
    (SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to elect to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value that are not currently required to be measured at
    fair value. This election is irrevocable. SFAS No. 159
    will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2009. Applied is
    evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of
    SFAS No. 159 on its financial position and results of
    operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value” (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157
    becomes effective for Applied in fiscal 2009. Applied is
    evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of
    SFAS 157 on its financial position and results of
    operations.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48,
    “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties”
    (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing
    the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements
    as

“more-likely-than-not”

to be sustained by the taxing authority. The recently issued
    literature also provides guidance on the derecognition,
    measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties,
    along with any related interest and penalties. FIN 48 also
    includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax
    uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of
    disclosures associated with any recorded income tax
    uncertainties. FIN 48 will become effective for Applied
    beginning in fiscal 2008. Any differences between the amounts
    recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the
    adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after adoption
    will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment recorded
    to the beginning balance of retained earnings. Applied will
    continue to evaluate the application of FIN 48. Management
    does not believe the effect of implementing FIN 48 will
    have a material impact on its financial position or results of
    operations.

Financial
    Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Applied’s cash, cash equivalents and investments increased
    from $3.2 billion at October 29, 2006 to
    $3.7 billion at October 28, 2007, due primarily to
    cash generated from operating activities and proceeds from
    common stock issuances, offset by share repurchases, cash paid
    for acquisitions and cash dividend distributions. Applied has
    not undertaken any significant external financing activities for
    several years.

Applied generated cash from operating activities of
    $2.2 billion in fiscal 2007, $2.0 billion in fiscal
    2006, and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2005. The primary sources
    of cash from operating activities were net income, as adjusted
    to exclude the effect of non-cash charges including
    depreciation, amortization, equity-based compensation, asset
    impairments and restructuring and IPR&D expenses, and
    changes in working capital levels, including accounts receivable
    and inventories. Applied utilized programs to discount letters
    of credit issued by customers of $431 million in fiscal
    2007, $237 million in fiscal 2006, and $145 million in
    fiscal 2005. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many
    factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to
    discount the letters of credit and the cost of such
    arrangements. Days sales outstanding were 79 days at the
    end of fiscal 2007, compared to 80 days at the end of
    fiscal 2006 and 85 days at the end of fiscal 2005. The
    decrease in days sales outstanding in fiscal 2007 was primarily
    related to the change in the regional sales mix. Inventories
    decreased by $94 million in fiscal 2007, reflecting
    improved working capital management during a period of increased
    business volume and sales activity.

Applied used $977 million of cash for investing activities
    in fiscal 2007, generated $1.9 billion of cash for
    investing activities in fiscal 2006 and used $219 million
    of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2005. Purchases of
    investments, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments, totaled $150 million for fiscal 2007. Proceeds
    from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of
    investments, totaled $2.6 billion in fiscal 2006 and
    $83 million in fiscal 2005. Proceeds from the sale of
    investments in fiscal 2006 were used principally to
    fund Applied’s accelerated stock buyback.

Capital expenditures were $265 million in fiscal 2007,
    $179 million in fiscal 2006 and $200 million in fiscal
    2005. Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures included investment in
    the implementation of an enterprise resource planning software
    system, and in Applied’s new global development capability
    center in Xi’an, China. Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures
    included purchases of lab equipment, network infrastructure and
    three buildings in Santa Clara, California that Applied had
    previously leased. Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures included
    investments in laboratory equipment and upgrades to
    Applied’s enterprise resource planning software and network
    architecture.

Investing activities also included investments in technology and
    acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market
    opportunities or emerging technologies. During fiscal 2007,
    Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of HCT for
    $463 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and certain net
    assets of Brooks Software for $137 million in cash. During
    fiscal 2006, Applied paid cash for acquisitions and the
    investment in a joint venture totaling $486 million. During
    fiscal 2006, Applied acquired the outstanding stock of Applied
    Films for $310 million in cash, net of cash and marketable
    securities acquired, and assumed equity awards with a fair value
    of $26 million, of which $18 million was included in
    the purchase price; formed a joint venture, Sokudo, with
    Dainippon Screen Mfg. Ltd., for which Applied paid
    $147 million in cash and contributed other assets; acquired
    certain assets of UMS Solutions for $10 million; and
    acquired ChemTrace for approximately $22 million in cash,
    net of cash acquired, of which $18 million was paid upon
    closing. During fiscal 2005, Applied paid $102 million, net
    of cash acquired, for the Metron and EcoSys acquisitions. See
    Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional details.

On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum,
    Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts
    cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. On
    November 19, 2007, Applied entered into an agreement to
    acquire all of the outstanding shares of Baccini S.p.A.
    (Baccini), a

privately-held

company based in Italy, for €225 million (or
    approximately $330 million at the exchange rate at the time
    of announcement) in cash, which is expected to close in early
    2008.

Applied used cash of $892 million for financing activities
    in fiscal 2007, $4.1 billion in fiscal 2006, and
    $1.6 billion in fiscal 2005. Financing activities included
    issuances and repurchases of common stock and payment



of dividends. Since March 1996, Applied has systematically
    repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market. Cash
    used to repurchase shares totaled $1.3 billion in fiscal
    2007, $4.2 billion in fiscal 2006, and $1.7 billion in
    fiscal 2005. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2005,
    Applied’s Board of Directors declared four consecutive
    quarterly cash dividends, in the amount of $0.03 per share each.
    The first two declared cash dividends totaling $98 million
    were paid during fiscal 2005. Beginning in the second quarter of
    fiscal 2006, Applied’s Board declared three consecutive
    quarterly cash dividends, in the amount of $0.05 per share each.
    Cash dividends totaling $251 million were paid during
    fiscal 2006. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2007,
    Applied’s Board declared three consecutive quarterly cash
    dividends, in the amount of $0.06 per share each. Cash dividends
    totaling $306 million were paid during fiscal 2007. Applied
    currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be
    paid on a quarterly basis in the future, although the
    declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of
    the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s
    financial condition, results of operations, capital
    requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as
    a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of
    Applied’stockholders. Financing activities also included
    borrowings and repayments of debt. Applied did not have any
    borrowings in fiscal years 2005, 2006 or 2007. As of
    October 28, 2007, Applied had credit facilities for
    unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to
    approximately $1.2 billion, of which $1.0 billion is
    comprised of a

5-year

revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is
    scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for
    borrowings at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates
    selected by Applied for each advance, and includes financial and
    other covenants with which Applied was in compliance at
    October 28, 2007. No amounts were outstanding under this
    agreement at October 28, 2007. Cash used for debt
    repayments totaled $202 million for fiscal 2007,
    $8 million for fiscal 2006, and $62 million for fiscal
    2005. Cash generated from issuances of common stock pursuant to
    Applied’s equity compensation programs totaled
    $948 million for fiscal 2007, $361 million for fiscal
    2006, and $266 million for fiscal 2005.

On September 18, 2006, Applied entered into accelerated
    stock buyback agreements with Goldman Sachs under which Applied
    agreed to repurchase from Goldman Sachs shares of Applied’s
    outstanding common stock for an initial purchase price of
    $2.5 billion. Under the agreements, Applied purchased
    145 million shares of its common stock on
    September 18, 2006 at a price per share of $17.20, and
    Goldman Sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of shares
    in the open market over the following four months. At the end of
    the four month period, Applied was entitled or subject to a
    price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of
    Applied common stock during the purchase period. On
    January 24, 2007, Applied settled the price adjustment of
    $132 million by payment in cash to Goldman Sachs, resulting
    in an adjusted price per share of $18.08. The repurchase was
    funded with Applied’s existing cash and investments. The
    repurchased shares were reported as treasury stock.

At October 28, 2007, cash and cash equivalents included an
    aggregate investment of $147 million in an enhanced cash
    fund (the “Fund”). During the period between
    October 29, 2007 and December 6, 2007, Applied
    redeemed net $61 million of its investment in the Fund at
    par value (net of interim transactions). On December 6,
    2007, the Fund’s manager notified Applied that:
    (1) cash redemptions were temporarily suspended, although
    redemptions could be fulfilled through a pro rata distribution
    of the underlying securities, consisting principally of high
    quality corporate debt, mortgage-backed securities and
    asset-backed securities; (2) the Fund’s valuation will
    be based on the market value of the underlying securities,
    whereas historically the Fund’s valuation was based on
    amortized cost; and (3) interest would continue to accrue.
    The estimated carrying value of Applied’s investment in the
    Fund at December 6, 2007 was $86 million and is not
    considered a cash equivalent due to the suspension of Fund
    redemptions. Applied expects to receive a pro rata distribution
    of the underlying securities in the Fund. Applied anticipates
    that this redemption will not result in a significant loss. The
    securities received on redemption will be subject to changes in
    value depending on market conditions.

Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing
    and extent of factors such as those discussed above,
    Applied’s management believes that cash generated from
    operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing
    cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to
    satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next
    12 months. For further details regarding Applied’s
    operating, investing and financing activities for each of the
    three years in the period ended October 28, 2007, see the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report.



Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 28, 2007, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee agreements was
    approximately $194 million. Applied has not recorded any
    liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements below
    that required Applied to appropriately account for the
    underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not
    believe, based on historical experience and information
    currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will
    be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total
    rental expense for operating leases was $62 million for
    fiscal 2007, $70 million for fiscal 2006, and
    $87 million for fiscal 2005.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related
    disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
    amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in
    the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
    Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered
    to be critical accounting policies.

A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both
    material to the presentation of Applied’s consolidated
    financial statements and requires management to make difficult,
    subjective or complex judgments that could have a material
    effect on Applied’s financial condition or results of
    operations. Specifically, these policies have the following
    attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions
    about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the
    estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could
    reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are
    reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on
    Applied’s financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects
    cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates
    on historical experience and on various other assumptions
    believed to be applicable and reasonable under the
    circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur,
    as additional information is obtained and as Applied’s
    operating environment changes. These changes have historically
    been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management
    is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which
    are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged
    periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the
    section above entitled “Risk Factors.” Based on a
    critical assessment of its accounting policies and the
    underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the



application of those policies, management believes that
    Applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly
    stated in accordance with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America, and provide a
    meaningful presentation of Applied’s financial condition
    and results of operations.

Management believes that the following are critical accounting
    policies:

Warranty
    Costs

Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue
    is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by
    analyzing specific product and historical configuration
    statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied’s
    warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure
    rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting
    product failures during the warranty period. As Applied’s
    customer engineers and process support engineers are highly
    trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a
    significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and
    availability of critical replacement parts is another
    significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen
    component failures or exceptional component performance can also
    result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs
    differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to
    the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could
    have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Inventory
    Valuation

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market,
    with cost determined on a

first-in,

first-out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for
    estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and
    the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
    demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for
    potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing
    historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are
    evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known
    and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If
    actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated,
    additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete
    inventory might be required, which could have a material adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also
    reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually
    for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology,
    are generally recorded in connection with a business
    acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually
    based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the
    success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If
    actual product acceptance differs significantly from the
    estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment
    charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. The fair
    value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market
    multiples approach, and is dependent on market values for
    companies in a similar industry. A severe decline in market
    value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for
    impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Income
    Taxes

Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax
    assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect
    of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of
    recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a
    valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion
    of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has
    determined that it is more likely than not that its future
    taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax
    assets.

The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
    composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing
    each region, non-tax deductible expenses incurred in connection
    with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management
    carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the
    effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ
    from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a
    valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its
    effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.



The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment
    in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of
    complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
    inconsistent with Applied’s expectations could have a
    material impact on Applied’s results of operations and
    financial condition.

Legal
    Matters

Applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims,
    either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course
    of business. Applied evaluates, among other factors, the degree
    of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably
    estimates the amount of the loss. Significant judgment is
    required in both the probability determination and as to whether
    an exposure can be reasonably estimated. When Applied determines
    that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount
    is reasonably estimable, the effect is recorded in the
    consolidated financial statements. Although the outcome of these
    claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not
    believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a
    material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
    operations. However, significant changes in legal proceedings
    and claims, or the factors considered in the evaluation of those
    matters, could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Equity-Based
    Compensation — Employee Stock Option Plans and
    Employee Stock Purchase Plans

Beginning on October 31, 2005, Applied began accounting for
    stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) shares
    under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123(R),

“Share-Based

Payment”

(SFAS 123(R)), which requires recognition
    of the fair value of equity-based compensation. The fair value
    of stock options and ESPP shares was estimated using a
    Black-Scholes option valuation model. This methodology requires
    the use of subjective assumptions in implementing
    SFAS 123(R), including expected stock price volatility and
    the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity-based
    compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized
    over the service period of the award, and Applied has elected to
    use the straight-line method. Prior to the implementation of
    SFAS 123(R), Applied accounted for stock options and ESPP
    shares under the provisions of Accounting Principles Board
    Opinion No. 25,

“Accounting for Stock Issued to
    Employees,”

(APB 25) and made pro forma footnote
    disclosures as required by SFAS No. 148,
    “Accounting For Stock-Based Compensation —
    Transition and Disclosure — an Amendment of FASB
    Statement No. 123,” which amended
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting For Stock-Based
    Compensation.” Pro forma net income and pro forma net
    income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements were estimated using a Black-Scholes option
    valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units was
    calculated based upon the fair market value of Applied’s
    common stock at the date of grant (see Note 1 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements).

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

At October 28, 2007, Applied’s investment portfolio
    included fixed-income securities with a fair value of
    approximately $2.6 billion. Applied’s primary
    objective for investing in fixed-income securities is to
    preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk.
    These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will
    decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on
    Applied’s investment portfolio at October 28, 2007 and
    October 29, 2006, an immediate 100 basis point
    increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the
    fair value of the portfolio of approximately $31 million
    and $28 million, respectively. While an increase in
    interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment
    portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the
    Consolidated Statement of Operations unless the individual
    fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss
    is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

All of Applied’s debt bears interest at fixed rates.
    Therefore, an immediate 100 basis point increase in
    interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect
    on Applied’s near-term financial condition or results of
    operations.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign
    currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss
    francs. Applied enters into forward exchange and currency option
    contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and
    anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected
    to occur typically within



12 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are
    generally recognized in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations at the time that the related transactions being
    hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in
    currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option
    contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying
    items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected
    to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from
    changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use
    derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
    purposes. Net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a
    material effect on Applied’s results of operations for
    fiscal 2005, 2006 or 2007.

Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency
    as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen, euro,
    Israeli shekel and Swiss francs), and the terms of the forward
    exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying
    transactions. Applied’s outstanding forward exchange
    contracts are marked-to-market (see Note 2 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements), as are the majority of the
    related underlying transactions being hedged; therefore, the
    effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is
    expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these
    changes on the underlying transactions. The effect of an
    immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward
    exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not
    expected to be material to Applied’s near-term financial
    condition or results of operations. Applied’s risk with
    respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium
    paid for the right to exercise the option. Premiums paid for
    options outstanding at October 28, 2007 were not material.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As
    of the end of the period covered by this report, management of
    Applied conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with
    the participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures,
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based
    upon that evaluation, Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer concluded that Applied’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
    period covered by this report in ensuring that information
    required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that
    information required to be disclosed by Applied in such reports
    is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
    management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting.

Applied’s
    management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, management of Applied conducted an
    evaluation of the effectiveness of Applied’s internal
    control over financial reporting based upon the framework in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, Applied’s
    management concluded that Applied’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of October 28, 2007.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
    audited the consolidated financial statements included in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and, as part of the audit, has issued a report, included herein,
    on the effectiveness of Applied’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of October 28, 2007.



Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007, there were no changes in the internal control over
    financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect, Applied’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
    and Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

It should be noted that any system
    of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives
    of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any
    control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about
    the likelihood of future events.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries’
    (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of
    October 28, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control

—

Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting included in Item 9A. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Applied Materials Inc. and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 28, 2007, based on

Applied has the following equity compensation plans that have
    not been approved by stockholders:

2000 Global Equity Incentive Plan

The 2000 Global Equity
    Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan) was adopted effective as of
    June 21, 2000. The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of
    non-qualified stock options to employees other than officers and
    directors. The administrator of the 2000 Plan (either the Board
    of Directors of Applied or a committee appointed by the Board)
    determines the terms and conditions of all stock options
    granted; provided, however, that (1) the exercise price
    generally may not be less than 100 percent of the fair
    market value (on the date of grant) of the stock covered by the
    option, and (2) the term of options can be no longer than
    10 years (or 13 years in the event of death). A total
    of 147,000,000 shares have been authorized for issuance
    under the 2000 Plan, and 32,414,000 shares remain available
    for issuance as of October 28, 2007.

Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees

The Stock
    Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees (the Offshore ESPP) was
    adopted effective as of October 16, 1995 for the benefit of
    employees of Applied’s participating affiliates (other than
    United States citizens or residents). The Offshore ESPP provides
    for the grant of options to purchase shares of Applied common
    stock through payroll deductions pursuant to one or more
    offerings. The administrator of the Offshore ESPP (the Board of
    Directors of Applied or a committee appointed by the Board)
    determines the terms and conditions of all options prior to the
    start of an offering, including the purchase price of shares,
    the number of shares covered by the option and when the option
    may be exercised. All options granted as part of an offering
    must be granted on the same date. A total of



12,800,000 shares have been authorized for issuance under
    the Offshore ESPP, and 2,578,000 shares remain available
    for issuance as of October 28, 2007.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The
    consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Applied Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied or the
    Company) after elimination of intercompany balances and
    transactions. All references to a fiscal year apply to
    Applied’s fiscal year which ends on the last Sunday in
    October. Fiscal 2005, 2006 and 2007 contained 52 weeks
    each. Each fiscal quarter of 2005, 2006 and 2007 contained
    13 weeks.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    materially from those estimates.

Reclassifications

The accompanying consolidated financial
    statements for fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006 contain certain
    reclassifications to conform to the fiscal 2007 presentation.

In fiscal 2007, Applied changed its presentation of accretion of
    discounts and amortization of premiums on its investment
    portfolio and gains and losses on sales of investments in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. This revision did not
    result in material changes to operating cash flows in the
    accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The
    accompanying consolidated financial statements for prior year
    amounts have been conformed to the fiscal 2007 presentation.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

All highly-liquid
    investments with a remaining maturity of three months or less at
    the time of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. All
    of Applied’s investments are classified as
    available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates.
    Investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at
    fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any temporary
    difference between the cost and fair value of an investment is
    presented as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income/(loss). The specific identification method
    is used to determine the gains and losses on investments.

Inventories

Inventories are generally stated at the lower
    of cost or market, with cost determined on a FIFO basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and
    equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the
    estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line
    method. Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes
    are as follows: buildings and improvements, 3 to 30 years;
    demonstration and manufacturing equipment, 3 to 5 years;
    software, 3 to 5 years; and furniture, fixtures and other
    equipment, 3 to 15 years. Land improvements are amortized
    over the shorter of 15 years or the estimated useful life.
    Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of five
    years or the lease term.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets
    are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually
    during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Purchased
    technology and other intangible assets are presented at cost,
    net of accumulated amortization, and are amortized over their
    estimated useful lives of 1 to 15 years using the
    straight-line method.

Long-Lived Assets

Applied reviews long-lived assets for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.
    Applied assesses these assets for impairment based on estimated
    future cash flows from these assets.

Research, Development and Engineering Costs

Research,
    development and engineering costs are expensed as incurred.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as
    incurred. Advertising costs were not material for all periods
    presented.



APPLIED

    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Sales and Value Added Taxes

Taxes collected from
    customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented
    on a net basis in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of
    Operations.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense is based on pretax
    earnings. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
    the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between
    the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net
    operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.

Revenue Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue when all
    four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive
    evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or
    services have been rendered; seller’s price to buyer is
    fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.
    Applied’s shipping terms are customarily FOB Applied
    shipping point or equivalent terms. Applied’s revenue
    recognition policy generally results in revenue recognition at
    the following points: (1) for all transactions where legal
    title passes to the customer upon shipment, Applied recognizes
    revenue upon shipment for all products that have been
    demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment;
    the portion of revenue associated with certain
    installation-related tasks is deferred based on the estimated
    fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of
    the installation-related tasks; (2) for products that have
    not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to
    shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical
    acceptance; (3) for transactions where legal title does not
    pass at shipment, revenue is recognized when legal title passes
    to the customer, which is typically at customer technical
    acceptance; and (4) for arrangements containing multiple
    elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is
    deferred at estimated fair value until delivery of the deferred
    elements. In cases where Applied has sold products that have
    been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to
    shipment, Applied believes that at the time of delivery, it has
    an enforceable claim to amounts recognized as revenue. Spare
    parts revenue is generally recognized upon shipment, and
    services revenue is generally recognized over the period that
    the services are provided.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Applied uses financial
    instruments, such as forward exchange and currency option
    contracts, to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and
    anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions typically
    expected to occur within 12 months. The terms of currency
    instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent
    with the timing of the transactions being hedged. The purpose of
    Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the
    effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
    denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. All of
    Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at
    fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable
    instruments. For derivative instruments designated and
    qualifying as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency
    denominated transactions, the effective portion of the gain or
    loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders’ equity,
    and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction
    affects earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to
    occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective, the
    gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded
    promptly in earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge
    existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the
    gain or loss on these hedges is recorded promptly in earnings to
    offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or
    liabilities being hedged. Applied does not use derivative
    financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Translation

As of October 28, 2007,
    primarily all of Applied’s subsidiaries use the United
    States dollar as their functional currency. Accordingly, assets
    and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated using
    exchange rates in effect at the end of the period, except for
    non-monetary assets, such as inventories and property, plant and
    equipment, which are translated using historical exchange rates.
    Revenues and costs are translated using average exchange rates
    for the period, except for costs related to those balance sheet
    items that are translated using historical exchange rates. The
    resulting translation gains and losses are included in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations as incurred.

Equity-Based
    Compensation

Applied has adopted stock plans that provide for grants to
    employees of equity-based awards, including stock options,
    restricted stock and restricted stock units (also referred to as
    performance shares under the Applied



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Materials, Inc. Employee Stock Incentive Plan). In addition, the
    Employee Stock Incentive Plan provides for the automatic grant
    of restricted stock units to non-employee directors and permits
    the grant of equity-based awards to Applied consultants. Applied
    also has two Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP) for United
    States and international employees, respectively, which enable
    eligible employees to purchase Applied common stock.

On October 31, 2005, Applied implemented the provisions of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),
    “Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123(R)), using the
    modified prospective transition method. SFAS 123(R)
    requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services
    received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based upon
    the grant-date fair value of those awards. Using the modified
    prospective transition method of adopting SFAS 123(R),
    Applied began recognizing compensation expense for stock options
    and ESPP shares granted after October 30, 2005, plus
    equity-based awards granted prior to, and unvested as of
    October 31, 2005. As provided under this method of
    implementation, prior periods have not been restated. The
    estimated fair value of Applied’s equity-based awards, less
    expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards’ service
    periods on a straight-line basis.

On November 10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff position
    No. FAS 123(R)-3 “Transition Election Related to
    Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.”
    Applied implemented the alternative transition method provided
    in the FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax effects of
    equity-based compensation pursuant to SFAS 123(R). The
    alternative transition method includes simplified methods to
    establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in
    capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax effects of employee
    equity-based compensation, and to determine the subsequent
    impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows
    of the tax effects of employee equity-based compensation awards
    that are outstanding upon the implementation of SFAS 123(R).

Prior to October 31, 2005, Applied measured compensation
    expense for its employee equity-based compensation plans using
    the intrinsic value method under APB 25 and related
    interpretations. As the exercise price of all options granted
    under these plans was not below the fair market price of the
    underlying common stock on the grant date, insignificant
    equity-based compensation cost for stock options was recognized
    in the Consolidated Statements of Operations under the intrinsic
    value method.

During fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007, Applied recognized total
    equity-based compensation expense related to stock options, ESPP
    shares, restricted stock units and restricted stock of
    $216 million (or $0.11 per diluted share) and
    $161 million (of $0.08 per diluted share), respectively.
    During fiscal 2006 and 2007, Applied recognized income tax
    benefits related to equity-based compensation of
    $46 million and $45 million, respectively. The

equity-based

compensation expense related to restricted stock units and
    restricted stock for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 was
    $30 million and $104 million, respectively.

Stock
    Options

The exercise price of each stock option equals the market price
    of Applied’s stock on the date of grant. Most options are
    scheduled to vest over four years and expire no later than seven
    years after the grant date. The fair value of each option grant
    is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. This model was developed for use in estimating
    the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting
    restrictions and are fully transferable. Applied’s employee
    stock options have characteristics significantly different from
    those of publicly traded options. The weighted average
    assumptions used in the model are outlined in the following
    table:

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on a
    combination of historical and implied volatilities. When
    establishing the expected life assumption, Applied annually
    reviews historical employee exercise behavior of option grants
    with similar vesting periods.

Options outstanding had an aggregate intrinsic value of
    $165 million and $190 million at October 29, 2006
    and October 28, 2007, respectively. The weighted average
    grant date fair value of options granted during fiscal 2006 and
    fiscal 2007 was $54 million and $2 million,
    respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
    during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 was $57 million and
    $141 million, respectively. The total fair value of options
    that vested during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 was
    $256 million and $124 million, respectively. At
    October 29, 2006, Applied had $121 million of total
    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to stock option plans that will be recognized over the
    weighted average period of 1.1 years. At October 28,
    2007, Applied had $48 million of total unrecognized
    compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to
    stock option plans that will be recognized over the weighted
    average period of 0.8 years. Cash received from stock
    option exercises was $284 million and $837 million,
    respectively, during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007. The actual tax
    benefit realized for the tax deductions from options exercised
    for fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 totaled $24 million and
    $50 million, respectively. During fiscal 2006, as part of
    the acquisition of Applied Films, Applied assumed outstanding
    options to purchase Applied Films common stock that, at the
    acquisition date, had a fair value of $26 million,
    including $6 million of total unrecognized compensation
    expense, net of $2 million of estimated forfeitures (see
    Note 12). The Applied Films stock options assumed by
    Applied were converted into options to purchase 3 million
    shares of Applied common stock.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase Applied
    common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to
    85 percent of the lower of the fair market value at the
    beginning of the applicable offering period or at the end of
    each purchase period. The number of shares issued under the ESPP
    during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007 was 4,065,000 shares and
    4,310,000 shares, respectively. Based on the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model, the weighted average estimated fair value
    of purchase rights under the ESPP was $5.21 per share for the
    year ended October 29, 2006 and $4.83 per share for the
    year ended October 28, 2007. Compensation expense is
    calculated using the fair value of the employee’s purchase
    rights per the Black-Scholes model. Underlying assumptions used
    in the model are outlined in the following table:

Restricted
    Stock Units and Restricted Stock

Restricted stock units are converted into shares of Applied
    common stock upon vesting on a one-for-one basis. Typically,
    vesting of restricted stock units is subject to the
    employee’s continuing service to Applied. The compensation
    expense related to these awards was determined using the fair
    value of Applied’s common stock on the date of the grant,
    and compensation is recognized over the vesting period.
    Restricted stock units vest over a minimum of three years and
    typically vest over three to four years.

At October 29, 2006, Applied had $204 million total
    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to restricted stock unit grants, which will be
    recognized over the weighted average period of 1.7 years
    (see Note 8). At October 28, 2007, Applied had
    $271 million total unrecognized compensation expense, net
    of estimated forfeitures, related to restricted stock unit
    grants, which will be recognized over the weighted



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

average period of 1.5 years (see Note 8). During
    fiscal 2006, as part of the acquisition of Applied Films,
    Applied assumed Applied Films’ outstanding restricted stock
    units that, at the acquisition date, had a fair value of
    $298,000, including $130,000 of total unrecognized equity-based
    compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures. The Applied
    Films restricted stock units assumed are expected to convert
    into 19,000 shares of Applied common stock upon vesting.

On January 25, 2007, the Human Resources and Compensation
    Committee (the Committee) of the Board of Directors approved new
    awards of 1,950,000 performance-based restricted stock units for
    Applied’s named executive officers and other key employees.
    The Committee also approved the issuance of 150,000 shares
    of restricted stock to Applied’s President and Chief
    Executive Officer at $0.01 per share. These awards will vest
    only if specific performance goals set by the Committee are
    achieved. The goals require the achievement of specified levels
    of Applied’s annual operating profit and also that the
    officer remain an employee of Applied through the vesting date.
    The fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units
    and restricted stock was estimated using the fair value of
    Applied common stock on the date of the grant and assumes that
    performance goals will be achieved. If such goals are not met,
    no compensation cost will be recognized and any recognized
    compensation cost will be reversed. The expected cost of the
    grant is being reflected over the vesting period, and is reduced
    for estimated forfeitures. Fiscal 2007 equity-based compensation
    expense included $13 million attributable to the
    performance-based awards granted on January 25, 2007.

Pro Forma
    Information under SFAS 123 for Fiscal 2005

Prior to fiscal 2006, Applied followed the disclosure-only
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation” (SFAS 123), as amended. The following
    table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
    share for fiscal 2005 if the fair value recognition provisions
    of SFAS 123, as amended, had been applied to options
    granted under Applied’s equity-based compensation plans.
    For purposes of this pro forma disclosure, the estimated value
    of the options is recognized over the options’ vesting
    periods. If Applied had recognized the expense of equity-based
    compensation programs in the Consolidated Statements of
    Operations, additional paid-in capital would have increased by a
    corresponding amount, net of applicable taxes.

Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted
    average estimated fair value of employee stock option grants was
    $6.46. The weighted average estimated fair value of purchase
    rights granted under the ESPP was $5.65. The computation of the
    expected volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes
    calculations for new grants was based on a combination of
    historical and implied volatilities.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries

On October 28, 2007, Applied implemented the recognition
    and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (SFAS 158).
    SFAS 158 required Applied to recognize the funded status
    (the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the
    projected benefit obligations) of the defined benefit plan in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with a corresponding adjustment
    to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to
    measure the fair value of plan benefit obligations as of its
    fiscal year ending October 28, 2007 and to provide
    additional disclosures. The implementation of SFAS 158 did
    not have a material impact on Applied’s financial
    statements. For additional information on Applied’s
    employee benefit plans, see Note 8.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that
    potentially subject Applied to significant concentrations of
    credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents,
    investments, trade accounts receivable and derivative financial
    instruments used in hedging activities. Applied invests in a
    variety of financial instruments, such as, but not limited to,
    certificates of deposit, corporate and municipal bonds, United
    States Treasury and agency securities, and mortgage-backed
    securities, and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure
    with any one financial institution or commercial issuer.
    Applied’s customers consist principally of semiconductor
    and LCD manufacturers located throughout the world. Applied
    performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’
    financial condition and generally requires no collateral to
    secure accounts receivable. Applied maintains an allowance
    reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based
    on its assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable.
    Applied regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors
    such as historical experience, credit quality, age of the
    accounts receivable balances, and current economic conditions
    that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. In addition,
    Applied utilizes letters of credit to mitigate credit risk when
    considered appropriate. Applied is exposed to credit-related
    losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to
    derivative financial instruments, but does not expect any
    counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is determined
    using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
    during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined
    using the weighted average number of common shares and potential
    common shares (representing the dilutive effect of stock
    options, restricted stock units, ESPP shares and amounts due
    under the agreements associated with the accelerated stock
    buyback program) outstanding during the period. Applied’s
    net income has not been adjusted for any period presented for
    purposes of computing basic or diluted earnings per share.

For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted
    average potential common shares do not include stock options
    with an exercise price that exceeded the average fair market
    value of Applied’s common stock for the period, as the
    effect would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, options to purchase
    124,306,000, 123,317,000 and 51,094,000 shares of common
    stock for the fiscal years ended October 30, 2005,
    October 29, 2006 and October 28, 2007, respectively,
    were excluded from the computation.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value
    Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities Including
    an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115”
    (SFAS No. 159), which permits entities to elect to
    measure many financial instruments and certain other items at
    fair value that are not currently required to be measured at
    fair value. This election is irrevocable. SFAS No. 159
    will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2009. Applied is
    evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of
    SFAS No. 159 on its financial position and results of
    operations.



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value” (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157
    is effective for Applied in fiscal 2009. Applied is evaluating
    the potential impact of the implementation of SFAS 157 on
    its financial position and results of operations.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48,
    “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties”
    (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing
    the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements
    as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the
    taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides
    guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of
    income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and
    penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning
    accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and
    increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded
    income tax uncertainties. FIN 48 will become effective for
    Applied beginning in fiscal 2008. Any differences between the
    amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior
    to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after
    adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment
    recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. Applied
    will continue to evaluate the application of FIN 48.
    Management does not believe the effect of implementing

Applied regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify
    and evaluate investments that have indications of possible
    impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is
    temporary include: the length of time and extent to which fair
    market value has been lower than the cost basis, the financial
    condition and near-term prospects of the investee, credit
    quality, and Applied’s ability to hold the investment for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
    in fair market value. Generally, the contractual terms of the
    investments do not permit settlement at prices less than the
    amortized cost of the investments. Applied has determined that
    the gross unrealized losses on its investments at
    October 28, 2007 are temporary in nature. The gross
    unrealized losses related to investments are primarily due to a
    decrease in the fair market value of fixed-rate debt securities
    as a result of increases in interest rates. Accordingly, Applied
    does not consider the investments to be other-than-temporarily
    impaired at October 28, 2007, as it has the ability and
    intent to hold the investments for a period of time that may be
    sufficient for an anticipated recovery in fair market value.

The following table provides the gross unrealized losses and the
    fair market value of Applied’s investments with unrealized

Applied manages its cash equivalents and investments as a single
    portfolio of highly marketable securities that is intended to be
    available to meet Applied’s current cash requirements. For
    fiscal 2005, gross realized gains on sales of investments were
    $3 million, and gross realized losses were $8 million.
    For fiscal 2006, gross realized gains on sales of investments
    were $5 million, and gross realized losses were
    $28 million, principally attributable to the sale of
    investments to fund the accelerated stock buyback program
    discussed in Note 7. For fiscal 2007, gross realized gains
    on sales of investments were $2 million, and gross realized
    losses were $2 million.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative instruments
    and hedging activities, including foreign currency exchange
    contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value.
    Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for
    hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of any
    hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All of
    Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at
    their fair value in other current assets or accounts payable and
    accrued expenses.

Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with
    certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as
    Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss francs. The purpose
    of Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the
    effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
    denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The terms
    of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally
    consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged.

Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward
    exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge
    certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions
    expected to occur typically within the next 12 months.
    Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and
    documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and
    are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion
    of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in
    stockholders’ equity and is reclassified into earnings when
    the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) at
    October 28, 2007 will generally be reclassified into
    earnings within 12 months. Changes in the fair value of
    currency forward exchange and option contracts due to changes in
    time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness and
    are recognized in cost of products sold and general and
    administrative expenses. The change in option and forward time
    value was not material for fiscal 2005, 2006 or 2007. If the
    transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any
    derivative is ineffective, Applied promptly recognizes the gain
    or loss on the associated financial instrument in general and
    administrative expenses. The amounts recognized due to
    anticipated transactions failing to occur were not material for
    all periods presented.



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain
    foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. These
    derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
    Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are
    recorded promptly in earnings to offset the changes in the fair
    value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

Derivative-related activity in accumulated other comprehensive
    income/(loss), net of taxes, was as follows:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts
    of Applied’s financial instruments, including cash and cash
    equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable, and accounts
    payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to the
    short maturities of these financial instruments. At
    October 29, 2006, the carrying amount of long-term debt was
    $407 million and the estimated fair value was
    $428 million. At October 28, 2007, the carrying amount
    of long-term debt was $205 million and the estimated fair
    value was $226 million. The estimated fair value of
    long-term debt is based primarily on quoted market prices for
    the same or similar issues.

Goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are not amortized but
    are subject to annual reviews for impairment, which Applied
    performs during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Applied
    conducted these impairment tests in fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2007,
    and the results of these tests indicated that Applied’s
    goodwill and unamortized intangible assets were not impaired.
    Goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are also subject to
    review for impairment when circumstances or events occur during
    the year that indicate that the assets may be impaired. From
    October 29, 2006 to October 28, 2007, the change in
    goodwill was $428 million, primarily due to the
    acquisitions of HCT Shaping Systems SA (HCT) and Brooks Software
    (see Note 12). Other assets that are not subject to
    amortization consist primarily of a trade name associated with
    the Metron Technology N.V. acquisition and is reported in the
    Fab Solutions segment. As of October 28, 2007 goodwill and
    unamortized intangible assets by reportable segment was:
    Adjacent Technologies, $484 million; Silicon,
    $224 million; Fab Solutions, $194 million and Display,

    the straight-line method. From October 29, 2006 to
    October 28, 2007, the change in gross carrying amount of
    the amortized intangible assets was approximately
    $197 million, primarily due to the acquisitions of HCT and
    Brooks Software (see Note 12). Aggregate amortization
    expense was $31 million and $57 million for fiscal
    2006 and 2007, respectively. As of October 28, 2007, future
    estimated amortization expense is expected to be
    $92 million for fiscal 2008, $45 million for fiscal
    2009, $44 million for fiscal 2010, $41 million for
    fiscal 2011, $40 million for fiscal 2012, and
    $93 million thereafter. As of October 28, 2007,

Borrowing
    Facilities

    $1.2 billion, of which $1.0 billion is comprised of a

5-year

revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is
    scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for
    borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to
    one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance, and
    includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in
    compliance at October 28, 2007. No amounts were outstanding
    under this agreement at

Applied has debt agreements that contain financial and other

    minimum financial ratios. At October 28, 2007, Applied was
    in compliance with all covenants.

Aggregate debt maturities at October 28, 2007 were:
    $3 million in fiscal 2008, $913,000 in fiscal 2009,
    $912,000 in fiscal 2010, $456,000 in fiscal 2011 and
    $200 million thereafter.

Restructuring
    and Asset Impairments

During fiscal 2007, Applied recognized restructuring and asset
    impairment charges of $26 million, including
    $18 million in restructuring charges and $8 million in
    asset impairments. Fiscal 2007 restructuring and asset
    impairment charges included $30 million associated with the
    decision to cease development of beamline implant products,
    offset by $3 million in adjustments associated with
    subsequent sales of properties held for sale. During fiscal
    2006, Applied recognized restructuring and asset impairment
    charges of $212 million, including $128 million in
    asset impairments and $92 million in restructuring charges
    primarily associated with the closure of its Hayward, California
    facility, offset by $8 million in adjustments associated
    with realignment programs of prior years.

On February 9, 2007, the Board of Directors of Applied
    approved a plan (the Plan) to cease development of beamline
    implant products for semiconductor manufacturing and curtail the
    operations of its Implant group based in Horsham, England. Under
    the Plan, Applied closed its research and development and
    manufacturing operations in Horsham in October 2007. The total
    cost of implementing the Plan is expected to be in the range of
    $95 million to $110 million, and is reported in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations under cost of products
    sold and operating expenses (including restructuring and asset
    impairment charges). The majority of the cash outlays in
    connection with the Plan occurred in fiscal 2007. The Implant
    group operated in the Silicon segment and the results of its
    operations were not material to the segment’s financial
    position or results of operations.

Costs under the Plan in fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of
    inventory-related charges reported as cost of products sold of
    $56 million, other operating expenses of $10 million,
    and restructuring and asset impairment charges of
    $30 million. Applied recorded restructuring charges of
    $22 million, consisting primarily of employee termination
    costs to reduce its workforce by approximately 215 positions.
    The majority of the affected employees were based in Horsham,
    England, and represented multiple functions. Asset impairment
    charges included $8 million of fixed asset write-offs.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied’s Board of
    Directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of
    Applied’s real estate and facilities portfolio (the
    Disinvestment Plan). Properties with an estimated fair value of
    $56 million were reported as assets held-for-sale and
    reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded
    an asset impairment charge of $124 million to write down
    the following properties to estimated fair value:
    (1) facilities in Narita, Japan, Chunan, Korea, Hillsboro,
    Oregon, and Danvers, Massachusetts; and (2) 26 acres
    of unimproved land in Hillsboro, Oregon. During fiscal 2006,
    Applied sold the Danvers facility for net proceeds of
    $16 million and recognized a gain of $4 million.
    During fiscal 2007, Applied sold the Hillsboro, Chunan, and
    Narita facilities and the Hillsboro land for total net proceeds
    of $38 million and recognized a gain of $3 million.

During fiscal 2006 as part of the Disinvestment Plan, Applied
    recorded lease termination charges in the amount of
    $89 million, related to the closure of its leased Hayward,
    California facility.

There were no restructuring, asset impairments or other charges

Stock Repurchase Program

Since March 1996, Applied has
    systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the
    open market. In March 2006, the Board of Directors approved a
    stock repurchase program for up to $5.0 billion in
    repurchases over the next three years ending in March 2009.
    Pursuant to this authorization, on September 18, 2006,
    Applied entered into accelerated stock buyback agreements with
    Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Goldman Sachs), under which
    Applied agreed to purchase from Goldman Sachs outstanding shares
    of Applied common stock for an initial purchase price of
    $2.5 billion. Under the agreements, Applied purchased
    145 million shares of its common stock on
    September 18, 2006 at a price per share of $17.20, and
    Goldman Sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of shares
    in the open market over the following four months. At the end of
    the four month period, Applied was entitled or subject to a
    price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of
    Applied common stock during the purchase period. On
    January 24, 2007, Applied settled the price adjustment of
    $132 million by payment in cash to Goldman Sachs, resulting
    in an adjusted price per share of $18.08. The repurchase was
    funded with Applied’s existing cash and investments and
    reported as treasury stock.

On September 15, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a
    new stock repurchase program for up to $5.0 billion in
    repurchases over the next three years ending in September 2009,
    of which authorization for $3.8 billion of repurchases
    remained as of October 28, 2007. Under this authorization,
    Applied is continuing a systematic stock repurchase program and
    also may make supplemental stock repurchases from time to time,
    depending on market conditions, stock price and other factors.
    In fiscal 2006, there were 238,397,000 shares repurchased
    at an average price of $17.35 per share. In fiscal 2007, there
    were 60,561,000 shares repurchased at an average price of
    $19.81 per share.

Dividends

Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.03 per share
    each in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, Applied’s Board of
    Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of
    $0.03 per share and three quarterly cash dividends in the amount
    of $0.05 per share each. During fiscal 2007, Applied’s
    Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend in the
    amount of $0.05 per share and three quarterly cash dividends in
    the amount of $0.06 per share each. The fourth quarterly cash
    dividend declared in fiscal 2007 was paid on December 6,
    2007 to stockholders of record as of November 15, 2007.
    Dividends paid during fiscal 2005, 2006 and fiscal 2007 amounted
    to $98 million, $251 million and $306 million,
    respectively. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at
    the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on
    Applied’s financial condition, results of operations,
    capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as
    well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best
    interest of Applieds’ stockholders.

Employees Stock Purchase Plan

Applied sponsors two
    Employee Stock Purchase Plans (collectively, ESPP) for the
    benefit of United States (U.S.) and international employees,
    respectively. The U.S. plan is qualified under
    Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the ESPP,
    substantially all employees may purchase Applied common stock
    through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85 percent
    of the lower of the fair market value of the stock at the
    beginning of the offering period or at the end of each
    applicable purchase period. The ESPP provides for consecutive
    and overlapping offering periods of up to 24 months in
    duration, with each offering period composed of four consecutive
    six-month purchase periods. ESPP contributions are limited to a
    maximum of 10 percent of an employee’s eligible
    compensation, up to a maximum of $6,500 per six-month purchase
    period. ESPP participants are also limited to purchasing a
    maximum of 1,000 shares per purchase period. Shares issued
    under the ESPP were 4,879,000 for fiscal 2005, 4,065,000 for
    fiscal 2006, and 4,310,000 for fiscal 2007. At October 28,
    2007, there were 76,359,252 shares available for future
    issuance under the ESPP.

Employee Bonus Plans

Applied has various employee bonus
    plans. A profit-sharing plan provides for the distribution of a
    percentage of pre-tax profits to substantially all Applied
    employees who are not eligible for other performance-based
    incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of eligible
    compensation. Other plans award annual bonuses to Applied’s
    executives and other key contributors based on the achievement
    of profitability

and/or

other
    specified performance criteria. Applied also has agreements with
    key technical employees that provide for additional compensation
    related to the success of new product development and
    achievement of specified profitability criteria. Charges to
    expense under these plans were $138 million for fiscal
    2005, $262 million for fiscal 2006 and $271 million
    for fiscal 2007.

Employee Savings and Retirement Plan

Applied’s
    Employee Savings and Retirement Plan (401(k) Plan) is qualified
    under Sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue
    Code. Eligible employees may make salary deferral and

catch-up

contributions under the 401(k) Plan on a pre-tax basis. Applied
    matches a percentage of each participant’s salary deferral
    contributions with cash contributions. In general, these
    matching contributions become 20 percent vested at the end
    of an employee’s second year of service with Applied, and
    vest 20 percent per year of service thereafter, becoming
    fully vested at the end of six years of service. Participants
    may direct that funds held in their 401(k) Plan accounts,
    including any Applied matching contributions, be invested in any
    of the diversified investment funds available under the 401(k)
    Plan or in the Applied Materials, Inc. Common Stock Fund (Stock
    Fund), which invests solely in shares of Applied common stock.
    Effective June 21, 2007, the Stock Fund was converted into
    a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (within the
    meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code)
    and, as a result, participants have the option of specifying
    that any future cash dividends paid on shares held in the Stock
    Fund be either reinvested in the Stock Fund or distributed
    directly to them in cash no later than 90 days after the
    calendar year for which the dividends were paid. Applied’s
    matching contributions under this plan were approximately
    $25 million, net of $1 million in forfeitures, for
    fiscal 2005, $27 million, net of $2 million in
    forfeitures, for fiscal 2006 and $28 million, net of
    $1 million in forfeitures, for fiscal 2007.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries

Several of Applied’s foreign subsidiaries have defined
    benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their
    eligible employees. Benefits under these plans are typically
    based on years of service and final average compensation levels.
    Applied uses August 31 as a measurement date. The plans are
    managed in accordance with applicable local statutes and
    practices. Applied deposits funds for certain of these plans
    with insurance companies, pension trustees, government-managed
    accounts,

and/or

accrues the expense for the unfunded portion of the benefit
    obligation on its consolidated financial statements.
    Applied’s practice is to fund the various pension plans in
    amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements as
    established by applicable local governmental oversight and
    taxing authorities. Depending on the design of the plan, local
    custom and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may
    exceed qualified plan assets. The differences between the
    aggregate accumulated benefit obligations and aggregate plan
    assets of these plans have been recorded as liabilities by
    Applied and are included in accrued expenses and other
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On October 28, 2007, Applied implemented the recognition
    and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (SFAS 158).
    SFAS 158 required Applied to recognize the funded status
    (the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the
    projected benefit obligations) of the defined benefit plan in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with a corresponding adjustment
    to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to
    measure the fair value of plan benefit obligations as of its
    fiscal year ending October 28, 2007 and to provide
    additional disclosures.

Upon implementation, SFAS 158 requires an adjustment to
    accumulated other comprehensive income for the net unrecognized
    actuarial losses, unrecognized prior service costs and
    unrecognized transition obligations remaining from the initial
    adoption of SFAS No. 87, “Employers’
    Accounting for Pensions” (SFAS 87), all of which were
    previously netted against the plan’s funded status in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts will be subsequently
    recognized as net periodic pension cost in accordance with
    SFAS 87. The implementation of SFAS 158 had no effect
    on Applied’s Consolidated Statement of Operations for the
    year ended October 28, 2007, or for any prior period
    presented, and it is not expected to affect Applied’s
    operating results in future periods.

The incremental effect of applying SFAS 158 on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet at October 28, 2007 is presented

On February 9, 2007, the Board of Directors of Applied
    approved a plan to cease development of beamline implant
    products for semiconductor manufacturing and curtail the
    operations of its Implant group based in Horsham, England (see
    Note 6). A reduction in force led to a curtailment loss of
    $629,000, which is included in restructuring and asset
    impairment expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Applied’s investment strategy for its defined benefit plans
    is to invest assets in a prudent manner, maintaining
    well-diversified portfolios with the long-term objective of
    meeting the obligations of the plans as they come due. Asset
    allocation decisions are typically made by plan fiduciaries with
    input from Applied’s pension committee. Applied’s
    asset allocation strategy incorporates a sufficient equity
    exposure in order for the plans to benefit from the expected
    long-term outperformance of equities relative to the plans’
    liabilities. Applied retains investment managers, where
    appropriate, to manage the assets of the plans. Performance of
    investment managers is monitored by plan fiduciaries with the
    assistance of local investment consultants. The investment
    managers make investment decisions within the guidelines set
    forth by plan fiduciaries. Risk management practices include
    diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and
    periodic rebalancing toward target asset allocation ranges.
    Investment managers may use derivative instruments for efficient
    portfolio management purposes. Plan assets do not include any of
    Applied’s own equity or debt securities.

A summary of the components of net periodic pension costs and
    the weighted average assumptions used for net periodic pension
    cost and benefit obligation calculations for fiscal 2005, 2006

Future expected benefit payments over the next ten fiscal years
    are: $7 million in fiscal 2008, $7 million in fiscal
    2009, $8 million in fiscal 2010, $8 million in fiscal
    2011, $9 million in fiscal 2012, and $58 million
    collectively for fiscal years 2013 through 2017. Company
    contributions to these plans for fiscal 2008 are expected to be

Executive Deferred Compensation Plans

Applied sponsors
    two unfunded deferred compensation plans, the Executive Deferred
    Compensation Plan (Predecessor EDCP) and the 2005 Executive
    Deferred Compensation Plan (2005 EDCP), under which certain
    employees may elect to defer a portion of their following
    year’s eligible earnings. The Predecessor EDCP was frozen
    as of December 31, 2004 such that no new deferrals could be
    made under the plan after that date and the plan would qualify
    for “grandfather” relief under Section 409A of
    the Internal Revenue Code. The Predecessor EDCP participant
    accounts continue to be maintained under the plan and credited
    with deemed interest. The 2005 EDCP was implemented by Applied
    effective as of January 1, 2005 and is intended to comply
    with the requirements of Section 409A of the Internal
    Revenue Code. Amounts payable, including accrued deemed
    interest, totaled $79 million at October 29, 2006 and
    $82 million at October 28, 2007, which were included
    in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

Post-Retirement Benefits

On January 1, 1999, Applied
    implemented a plan that provides certain medical and vision
    benefits to eligible retirees who are at least age 55 and
    who have at least 10 years of service at their date of
    retirement. An eligible retiree may elect coverage for an
    eligible spouse or domestic partner who is not eligible for
    Medicare. Coverage under the plan generally ends for both the
    retiree and spouse or domestic partner upon becoming eligible
    for Medicare. As of October 28, 2007, Applied’s
    liability under the plan was $11 million which was included
    in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets. The discount rate of 5.9% used to calculate the benefit
    obligation was derived by reference to appropriate benchmark
    yields on high quality corporate bonds, allowing for the
    approximate duration of both plan obligations and the relevant
    benchmark index. Future expected benefit payments over the next
    ten fiscal years are: $596,000 in fiscal 2008, $637,000 in
    fiscal 2009, $692,000 in fiscal 2010, $737,000 in fiscal 2011,
    $742,000 in fiscal 2012, and $5.1 million collectively for
    fiscal years 2013 through 2017. Company contributions to the
    plan for fiscal 2008 are anticipated to be approximately
    $596,000.

For fiscal 2007, U.S. income taxes have not been provided
    for approximately $286 million of cumulative undistributed
    earnings of several

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Applied intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in
    operations outside of the U.S.

As of October 28, 2007, Applied’s tax credit
    carryforward was $11 million. The carryforward has an
    indefinite life. Management believes that the tax credit
    carryforward will be utilized in future periods.

Applied’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax
    benefits associated with employee stock option transactions.
    These benefits, credited directly to stockholders’ equity,
    amounted to $24 million for fiscal 2006 and

Note 10

Industry
    Segment and Geographic Operations

Applied’s four reportable segments are: Silicon, Fab
    Solutions, Display, and Adjacent Technologies. Applied’s
    chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the
    President and CEO, who reviews operating results to make
    decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance
    for the entire Company. Segment information is presented based
    upon Applied’s management organization structure as of
    October 28, 2007 and the distinctive nature of each
    segment. Future changes to this internal financial structure may
    result in changes to the reportable segments disclosed. Prior to
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied operated in one
    reportable segment.

Each reportable segment is separately managed and has separate
    financial results that are reviewed by Applied’s chief
    operating decision-maker. Each reportable segment contains
    closely related products that are unique to the particular
    segment. Segment operating income is determined based upon
    internal performance measures used by the President and CEO.

Applied derives the segment results directly from its internal
    management reporting system. The accounting policies Applied
    uses to derive reportable segment results are substantially the
    same as those used for external reporting purposes. Management
    measures the performance of each reportable segment based upon
    several metrics including orders, net sales and operating
    income. Management uses these results to evaluate the
    performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the
    reportable segments. Applied does not allocate to its reportable
    segments certain operating expenses, which it manages separately
    at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include
    equity-based compensation and certain components of variable
    compensation, corporate marketing and sales, corporate functions
    (certain management, finance, legal, human resources and
    RD&E), and unabsorbed information technology and occupancy
    costs. In addition, Applied does not allocate to its reportable
    segments restructuring and asset impairment charges and any
    associated adjustments related to restructuring actions. Segment
    operating income excludes interest income/expense and other
    financial charges and income taxes according to how a particular
    reportable segment’s management is measured. Management
    does not consider the unallocated costs in measuring the
    performance of the reportable segments.

The Silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for
    etch, rapid thermal processing (RTP), deposition, chemical
    mechanical planarization, and metrology and inspection.

The Fab Solutions segment includes products to improve the
    productivity and operating efficiency and lessen the
    environmental impact of customers’ factories and includes
    spares and remanufactured equipment sales. Customer demand for
    spare parts and services is fulfilled through a global
    distribution system with trained service engineers located in
    close proximity to customer sites.

The Display segment encompasses products and services for
    manufacturing LCDs for TVs, personal computers and other
    video-enabled devices. The Display segment also developments,
    manufactures and supports differentiated stand-alone equipment
    for the Applied SunFab Thin Film Line.

The Adjacent Technologies segment includes products and services
    for manufacturing solar cells, high throughput roll-to-roll
    coating systems for flexible electronics, and energy-efficient
    glass.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

Applied leases some of its facilities and equipment under
    non-cancelable operating leases and has options to renew most
    leases, with rentals to be negotiated. Total rent expense was
    $87 million for fiscal 2005, $70 million for fiscal
    2006, and $62 million for fiscal 2007. Future minimum lease
    payments at October 28, 2007 totaled $144 million and
    were: $59 million for fiscal 2008; $43 million for
    fiscal 2009; $18 million for fiscal 2010; $8 million
    for fiscal 2011; $4 million for fiscal 2012; and
    $12 million collectively for all periods thereafter.

Discounted
    Letters of Credit

Applied discounts letters of credit through various financial
    institutions. Under these agreements, Applied discounted letters
    of credit in the amounts of $145 million for fiscal 2005,
    $237 million for fiscal 2006 and $431 million for
    fiscal 2007. Discounting fees were not material for all periods

Guarantees

Applied products are generally sold with a

12-month

warranty period following installation. The provision for the
    estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is
    recognized. Parts and labor are covered under the terms of the
    warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based on
    historical experience by product, configuration and geographic
    region.

As noted above, Applied’s products are generally sold with
    a

warranty. Accordingly, current warranty provisions are related
    to the current year’s net sales, and warranty consumption
    is associated with current and prior year’s net sales.

During the ordinary course of business, Applied also provides
    standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to
    certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated
    by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 28,
    2007, the maximum potential amount of future payments that
    Applied could be required to make under these guarantee
    agreements was approximately $194 million. Applied has not
    recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee
    arrangements below that required to appropriately account for
    the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not
    believe, based on historical experience and information
    currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will
    be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate
    subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft
    arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of
    credit. As of October 28, 2007, Applied Materials Inc. has
    provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately
    $85 million to cover these services.

Legal
    Matters

Scharf

On July 31, 2001, David Scharf, an individual, filed a
    lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central
    District of California against Applied alleging that Applied had
    infringed, had induced others to infringe, and had contributed
    to others’ infringement of, a patent concerning color
    synthesizing scanning electron microscope technology.
    Mr. Scharf sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, a
    finding of willful infringement, damages (including treble
    damages) and costs. Applied answered the complaint and
    counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and
    invalidity. On May 10, 2002, Mr. Scharf filed a
    request for re-examination of his patent with the Patent and
    Trademark Office (PTO). On June 26, 2002, the case was
    removed from the Court’s active docket after the parties
    stipulated to stay the case pending the results of that
    re-examination. On July 11, 2002, Applied filed its own
    request for re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with
    the PTO. Applied’s request for re-examination was granted
    on September 19, 2002. On April 23, 2004, the PTO
    notified Applied that it intended to issue a re-examination
    certificate. On June 14, 2004, Applied filed a second
    request for re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with
    the PTO. The second request was denied on September 1,
    2004. On October 1, 2004, Applied filed a petition for
    reconsideration of that denial, which subsequently was denied.
    The parties completed fact discovery, and on February 22,
    2007, the Court held a claim construction hearing. The Court
    heard oral arguments regarding the parties’ motions for
    summary judgment on August 13, 2007, and denied both
    parties’

motions for summary judgment on August 20, 2007. Effective
    August 22, 2007, Applied acquired the Scharf patent.
    Applied and Scharf also mutually stipulated to the dismissal of
    all claims in the lawsuit with prejudice.

Linear

On March 12, 2002, Linear Technology Corp. (LTC) filed a
    lawsuit against Applied in the Superior Court of the County of
    Santa Clara, California, alleging claims for breach of
    contract, fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation,
    suppression of fact, unfair competition, breach of warranty,
    express contractual indemnity, implied equitable indemnity and
    declaratory relief related to LTC’s assertion that Applied
    is obligated to indemnify and defend LTC for certain claims in
    an underlying patent infringement lawsuit brought by Texas
    Instruments, Inc. After the Court dismissed many of its claims,
    LTC amended its complaint. LTC’s Amended Complaint, as well
    as its Second, Third and Fourth Amended Complaints, were
    dismissed by the Court in whole or in part. On July 7,
    2004, LTC filed a Fifth Amended Complaint, which the Court
    dismissed with prejudice on October 5, 2004. On
    January 11, 2005, LTC filed a notice of appeal of the
    dismissal of its complaint, and oral argument of the LTC appeal
    was heard by the California Sixth District Court of Appeal on
    April 19, 2007. On June 19, 2007, the Sixth District
    Court of Appeals entered an order that upheld the trial
    court’s dismissal of LTC’s claims for fraud and
    deceit, but reversed the trial court’s dismissal of
    LTC’s remaining claims and remanded the case to the trial
    court for further proceedings. On July 30, 2007, Applied
    filed notice that it would seek review by the California Supreme
    Court of the reversal and remand order of the Sixth District
    Court of Appeal. On October 19, 2007, the California
    Supreme Court denied Applied’s petition for review and
    returned the case to the Santa Clara Superior Court for
    further proceedings. Applied believes it has meritorious
    defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

Jusung

On December 24, 2003, Applied filed a lawsuit against
    Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. (Jusung Engineering) and Jusung
    Pacific Co., Ltd. (Jusung Pacific, referred to together with
    Jusung Engineering as Jusung) in Tao-Yuan District Court in
    Taiwan, captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung
    Engineering Co., Ltd. The lawsuit alleges that Jusung is
    infringing a patent related to chemical vapor deposition owned
    by Applied. In the lawsuit, Applied seeks a provisional
    injunction prohibiting Jusung from importing, using,
    manufacturing, servicing or selling in Taiwan certain flat panel
    display manufacturing equipment. On December 25, 2003, the
    Tao-Yuan District Court ruled in favor of Applied’s request
    for a provisional injunction and, on January 14, 2004, the
    Court issued a provisional injunction order against Jusung
    Pacific. Jusung Pacific appealed those decisions, and the
    decisions were affirmed on appeal. On January 30, 2004,
    Jusung Pacific requested permission to post a counterbond to
    have the Jusung Pacific injunction lifted. Jusung Pacific’s
    counterbond request was granted and, on March 30, 2004, the
    provisional injunction order was lifted. At Applied’s
    request, on December 11, 2004, the District Court issued a
    provisional injunction order against Jusung Engineering. Jusung
    Engineering appealed that order, and the order was affirmed on
    appeal. Jusung Engineering also requested permission to post a
    counterbond to have the Jusung Engineering injunction lifted.
    Jusung Engineering’s counterbond request was granted, and,
    on April 25, 2005, the provisional injunction order against
    Jusung Engineering was lifted. Applied has appealed both
    counterbond decisions. On June 30, 2004, Applied filed a
    “main action” patent infringement complaint against
    Jusung in the Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan, captioned
    Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. In
    the lawsuit, Applied seeks damages and a permanent injunction
    for infringement of the same patent. The decisions regarding the
    provisional injunction and counterbond have no effect on the
    separate patent infringement lawsuit filed by Applied against
    Jusung in the Hsinchu Court. In August 2006, the Court set the
    litigation fee and the litigation security payment, and the main
    action is now proceeding on its merits. This same patent is the
    subject of an invalidity proceeding filed in the Taiwanese
    Patent and Trademark Office by Jusung Pacific in June 2004.
    Applied believes it has meritorious claims and intends to pursue
    them vigorously.

On June 13, 2006, Applied filed an action in the Taiwanese
    Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of a patent
    owned by Jusung Engineering related to the severability of the
    transfer chamber. On June 20, 2006, Jusung Engineering
    filed a lawsuit against Applied and Applied’s subsidiary,
    AKT, in Hsinchu District Court



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

in Taiwan, captioned Jusung Engineering, Co. Ltd. v. AKT
    America, Inc. and Applied Materials, Inc., alleging infringement
    of this patent. Jusung Engineering’s lawsuit seeks damages,
    costs and attorneys’ fees, but does not seek injunctive
    relief. Applied believes that it has meritorious defenses that
    it intends to pursue vigorously. On January 31, 2007,
    Applied received notice that Jusung filed a complaint of private
    prosecution in the Taipei District Court of Taiwan dated
    November 10, 2006, entitled Jusung Engineering Co.,
    Ltd. v. M. Splinter, Y. Lin, C. Lai and J. Lin. The
    complaint alleges that Applied’s outside counsel received
    from the Court and used a copy of an expert report that Jusung
    had filed in the ongoing patent infringement lawsuits and that
    Jusung had intended to remain confidential. Jusung named as
    defendants Applied’s Taiwan attorneys, as well as Michael
    R. Splinter, Applied’s President and Chief Executive
    Officer, as the statutory representative of Applied. On
    April 27, 2007 the Taipei District Court dismissed
    Jusung’s private prosecution complaint. Jusung filed an
    appeal of the dismissal to the High Court. The High Court
    affirmed the District Court’s rejection of the private
    prosecution complaint on June 25, 2007. After the dismissal
    of the private prosecution complaint, the matter was transferred
    to the Taipei District Attorney’s Office, which issued a
    ruling not to prosecute. This ruling was reviewed by the
    District Attorney’s review body, which in October 2007
    returned the matter to the Taipei District Attorney’s
    Office for further consideration.

On April 3, 2007, Jusung filed a complaint against
    Applied’s subsidiary, AKT America, Inc. (AKT America), and
    one of its suppliers, in Seoul Central District Court in Seoul,
    Korea, captioned Jusung Engineering, Co. Ltd. v. AKT
    America, Inc. The complaint alleges infringement of a Jusung
    patent involving the showerhead assembly of PECVD equipment for
    LCDs and seeks injunctive relief. On June 9, 2007, AKT
    America and its supplier filed an invalidation action with the
    Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) against the patent
    asserted by Jusung. On November 30, 2007, the KIPO ruled
    that the Jusung patent was invalid. Applied believes that it has
    meritorious defenses that it intends to pursue vigorously. On
    August 13, 2007, Applied filed a complaint against Jusung
    in the Seoul Central District Court in Seoul, Korea, captioned
    Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung Engineering Ltd. The
    complaint alleges infringement of an Applied patent involving a
    substrate support or housing for a substrate supporting pin used
    in PECVD equipment for LCDs and seeks both monetary damages and
    injunctive relief. Jusung has contested its alleged infringement
    of this patent in the District Court action, and on
    October 29, 2007 filed an action with the KIPO seeking to
    invalidate Applied’s patent. Applied has initiated a
    confirmation of scope action with the Intellectual Property
    Tribunal of the KIPO based on the same patent.

On April 10, 2004, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC)
    notified Applied’s subsidiary AKT that, pursuant to a
    complaint filed by Jusung, the TFTC had begun an investigation
    into whether AKT had violated the Taiwan Fair Trade Act. The
    investigation focused on whether AKT violated the Taiwan
    Guidelines for the Review of Cases Involving Enterprises Issuing
    Warning Letters for Infringement on Copyright, Trademark and
    Patent Rights by allegedly notifying customers about AKT’s
    patent rights and the infringement of those rights by Jusung. On
    June 15, 2004, the TFTC notified Applied that Applied also
    was the subject of the investigation. The TFTC subsequently
    notified Applied and AKT America that there was insufficient
    evidence to support a claim against either company. Jusung
    appealed the TFTC’s decision, and the appeals court
    affirmed the decision of the TFTC. Jusung appealed the appeals
    court’s affirmation of the decision of the TFTC, and in
    January 2007, the Taipei High Administrative Court dismissed
    Jusung’s appeal. In February 2007, Jusung appealed the
    dismissal to the Supreme Administrative Court of Taiwan. Applied
    believes that Jusung’s complaint is without merit.

Silicon
    Services Consortium

On January 19, 2006, five companies that sell refurbished
    Applied tools (Silicon Services Consortium Inc., Semiconductor
    Support Services Co., OEM Surplus, Inc., Precision Technician
    Inc., and Semiconductor Equipment Specialist, Inc.) filed a
    lawsuit against Applied in the United States District Court for
    the Western District of Texas, captioned Silicon Services
    Consortium, Inc., et al. v. Applied Materials, Inc. The
    plaintiffs claim that a policy that Applied announced in January
    2005 of limiting the sale of certain parts to them constituted
    an unlawful attempt to monopolize the refurbishment business, an
    interference with existing contracts, and an interference with
    prospective business relationships. The suit seeks injunctive
    relief, damages, costs and attorneys’ fees. After Applied
    filed a motion to dismiss the original complaint, the plaintiffs
    filed an amended complaint alleging similar

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

conduct. Applied filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint
    on April 7, 2006, which the Court denied on
    February 16, 2007. Applied believes it has meritorious
    defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously. On
    January 17, 2007, Applied filed a counterclaim asserting
    claims for patent infringement, trademark infringement,
    trademark dilution, unfair competition, and misuse and
    misappropriation of trade secrets against each of the five
    plaintiffs/counterdefendants. Applied seeks damages, as well as
    injunctive relief. All claims between Applied and Precision
    Technician were dismissed in September 2007 pursuant to a
    settlement, with no payment by either party. The Court began a
    Markman hearing on October 18, 2007, continued that hearing
    to December 2007, and directed the parties to participate in
    mediation in November 2007. In December 2007, Applied reached a
    settlement with Semiconductor Equipment Specialist of all
    pending claims between them, under which Applied will pay a
    non-material sum. The Court has scheduled trial of the remaining
    claims to commence on November 3, 2008.

Applied does not believe that the outcome of any of the above
    matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition or results of operations. From time to time, Applied
    receives notification from third parties, including customers
    and suppliers, seeking indemnification, litigation support,
    payment of money or other actions by Applied in connection with
    claims made against them. In addition, from time to time,
    Applied receives notification from third parties claiming that
    Applied may be or is infringing their intellectual property or
    other rights. Applied also is subject to various other legal
    proceedings and claims, both asserted and unasserted, that arise
    in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of
    these claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
    Applied does not believe that any of these other existing
    proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on its
    consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Business
    Combinations and Equity-Method Investment

On August 23, 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding
    shares of Switzerland-based HCT Shaping Systems SA (HCT) for
    approximately $463 million in cash, net of cash acquired.
    HCT is the world’s leading supplier of precision wafering
    systems used principally in manufacturing crystalline silicon
    (c-Si) substrates for the solar industry. In connection with
    this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of $347 million
    and other intangible assets of $180 million. Of the
    $180 million acquired intangible assets, $59 million
    was assigned to purchased technology (amortized over
    11 years), $59 million was assigned to customer
    relationships (amortized over 7 years), $47 million
    was assigned to acquired backlog (amortized over 1 year),
    $8 million was assigned to trademarks and tradenames
    (amortized over 13 years) and $7 million was assigned
    to covenants not to compete (amortized over 3 years).

On March 30, 2007, Applied purchased Brooks Software for
    $137 million in cash. The acquired business is a leading
    provider of factory management and control software to the
    semiconductor and flat panel industries. The products complement
    Applied’s existing software applications and enable Applied
    to offer customers a comprehensive computer integrated
    manufacturing (CIM) solution for optimizing fab operations.
    The acquired business and its employees are being integrated
    within the Applied Global Services organization, which is
    reported under the Fab Solutions segment. Applied recorded an
    in-process research and development (IPR&D) expense of
    $5 million, reported as research, development and
    engineering expense, goodwill of $80 million, and other
    intangible assets of $47 million. Of the $47 million
    acquired intangible assets, $21 million was assigned to
    purchased technology (amortized over 4 —
    11 years), $21 million was assigned to maintenance
    contracts (amortized over 7 years), $2 million was
    assigned to acquired backlog (amortized over 1 year),
    $2 million was assigned to trademarks and tradenames
    (amortized over 7 years) and $1 million was assigned
    to customer relationships (amortized over 4 years).

The acquired IPR&D expense was determined by identifying
    research projects for which technological feasibility had not
    been established and no alternative future use existed. The
    value of the projects identified as in-process was determined by
    estimating the future cash flows from the projects once
    commercially feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to
    their present value at a rate commensurate with the level of
    risk and maturity of the projects, and then applying a
    percentage of completion to the calculated value.

On August 14, 2006, Applied’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Metron Technology, Inc. (Metron), purchased certain assets of
    UMS Solutions’ parts cleaning and recycling business in
    Singapore for $10 million. The acquisition enhances
    Metron’s capabilities in Southeast Asia with advanced,
    high-quality parts cleaning services to support its
    customers’ semiconductor manufacturing requirements. In
    connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $7 million and other intangible assets of $1 million.

On July 20, 2006, Applied and Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co.,
    Ltd. (Screen) completed the formation of Sokudo, a Japanese
    joint venture company, to deliver advanced track solutions for
    customers’ critical semiconductor manufacturing
    requirements. Screen owns 52 percent and holds the
    controlling interest in Sokudo, and Applied owns
    48 percent. Screen transferred into Sokudo its existing
    track business and related intellectual property, including
    employees, products and its installed base of systems. Applied
    paid $147 million for its investment in Sokudo.
    Additionally, Applied contributed to Sokudo certain technology
    and related intellectual property and will provide key
    development employees. Screen performs manufacturing for Sokudo
    under an outsourcing agreement. Applied accounts for its
    interest in Sokudo under the equity method of accounting. Under
    this accounting method, Applied’s exposure to loss from
    ongoing operations is limited to $115 million as of
    October 28, 2007, which represents Applied’s carrying
    value of its investment in Sokudo. Applied’s investment in
    Sokudo is classified as an equity-method investment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Applied’s investment in Sokudo
    includes the unamortized excess of Applied’s investment
    over its equity in the joint venture’s net assets. This
    excess $33 million at October 28, 2007 is being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful
    life of 7 years.

On July 7, 2006, Applied completed its acquisition of
    Applied Films Corporation, a Colorado corporation (Applied
    Films) and leading supplier of thin film deposition equipment
    used in manufacturing LCDs, solar cells, flexible electronics
    and energy-efficient glass. Applied paid $28.50 per share in
    cash for each outstanding share of Applied Films. The total
    purchase price was approximately $484 million, or
    $328 million net of Applied Films’ existing cash and
    marketable securities. As part of the acquisition, Applied
    assumed Applied Films’ outstanding stock options and
    restricted stock awards that, at the acquisition date, had a
    total fair value of $26 million, of which $18 million
    was allocated to the purchase price and the remainder to
    unearned compensation. Upon the acquisition and subject to
    vesting, Applied Films stock options became exercisable for
    shares of Applied common stock and Applied Films restricted
    stock awards became payable in shares of Applied common stock
    totaling, in the aggregate, 3 million shares of Applied
    common stock. The fair value of Applied Films’ stock
    options assumed was determined using a Black-Scholes model. The
    use of the Black-Scholes model and method of determining the
    variables is consistent with Applied’s valuation of
    equity-based compensation awards in accordance with
    SFAS 123(R) (see Note 1). Applied recorded an
    in-process research and development expense of $14 million,
    reported as research, development and engineering expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations; goodwill of
    $226 million; and other intangible assets of
    $140 million. The acquired in-process research and
    development expense was determined by identifying research
    projects for which technological feasibility had not been
    established and no alternative future use existed. The value of
    the projects identified as in-process was determined by
    estimating the future cash flows from the projects once
    commercially feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to
    their present value at a rate commensurate with the level of
    risk and maturity of the projects, and then applying a
    percentage of completion to the calculated value.

On December 23, 2005, Applied acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of ChemTrace Corporation and ChemTrace
    Precision Cleaning, Inc. for approximately $22 million in
    cash, net of cash acquired, of which $18 million was paid
    upon closing. This business provides customers with precision
    parts cleaning and materials testing solutions. In connection
    with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $12 million and other intangible assets of $8 million.

On June 28, 2005, Applied purchased certain assets of SCP
    Global Technology, Inc., consisting of single-wafer, HF-last
    immersion technology and Marangoni clean/dry intellectual
    property, for approximately $24 million in cash. In
    connection with this asset purchase, Applied recorded purchased
    technology and other intangible assets of $20 million and
    other items of $4 million.

On December 16, 2004, Applied acquired the assets of ATMI,
    Inc.’s Treatment Systems business (EcoSys), which supported
    the gas abatement requirements of process equipment for
    integrated circuit manufacturing and other industrial
    applications, for approximately $16 million in cash. In
    connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $5 million, purchased technology and other intangible
    assets of $8 million and other items of $3 million,
    including liabilities assumed upon acquisition.

On December 14, 2004, Applied acquired substantially all of
    the operating subsidiaries and businesses of Metron Technology
    N.V., a provider of a range of products and services for
    fab-wide operations, for approximately $85 million in cash.
    In connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill
    of $76 million and other intangible assets of
    $31 million, partially offset by other items of
    $22 million, primarily for net liabilities assumed upon
    acquisition.

For all of the purchase business combinations discussed above,
    the results of operations prior to the acquisition dates were
    not material in relation to those of Applied for any of the
    periods presented herein. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    reviewed periodically for impairment and purchased technology is
    amortized over its useful life of 1 to 15 years.

Subsequent
    Events

On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum,
    Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts
    cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. The
    acquisition complements and expands Applied’s existing
    Chamber Services network of facilities that provide customers
    worldwide with state-of-the-art technology and support for
    maintaining their chamber components.

On November 19, 2007, Applied entered into an agreement to
    acquire all of the outstanding shares of Baccini S.p.A.
    (Baccini), a privately-held company based in Italy, for
    €225 million (or approximately $330 million at
    the exchange rate at the time of announcement) in cash, which is
    expected to close in early 2008. Baccini is a leading supplier
    of automated metallization and test systems for manufacturing
    crystalline silicon (c-Si) photovoltaic (PV) cells. Completion
    of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions,
    including receipt of certain

non-U.S. regulatory

approvals.

At October 28, 2007, cash and cash equivalents included an
    aggregate investment of $147 million in an enhanced cash
    fund (the “Fund”). During the period between
    October 29, 2007 and December 6, 2007, Applied
    redeemed net $61 million of its investment in the Fund at
    par value (net of interim transactions). On December 6,
    2007, the Fund’s manager notified Applied that:
    (1) cash redemptions were temporarily suspended, although
    redemptions could be fulfilled through a pro rata distribution
    of the underlying securities, consisting principally of high
    quality corporate debt, mortgage-backed securities and
    asset-backed securities; (2) the Fund’s valuation will
    be based on the market value of the underlying securities,
    whereas historically the Fund’s valuation was based on
    amortized cost; and (3) interest would continue to accrue.
    The estimated carrying value of Applied’s investment in the
    Fund at December 6, 2007 was $86 million and is not
    considered a cash equivalent due to the suspension of Fund
    redemptions.

REPORT
    OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    October 28, 2007 and October 29, 2006, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended October 28, 2007. In
    connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
    statements, we also have audited the financial statement
    schedule as of and for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended October 28, 2007, as set forth under
    Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    October 28, 2007 and October 29, 2006, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended October 28, 2007, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
    schedule as of and for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended October 28, 2007, when considered in relation
    to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective October 28, 2007, the Company adopted
    the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 158,

Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an
    amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132(R)

. Also as discussed in note 1 to the consolidated
    financial statements, effective October 31, 2005, the
    Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R),

Share Based Payment

, applying the modified-prospective
    method.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 28, 2007, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated December 14, 2007 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.
