PART I

Item 1:

Business

Organized in 1967, Applied, a Delaware corporation, develops,
    manufactures, markets and services integrated circuit
    fabrication equipment for the worldwide semiconductor and
    semiconductor-related industry. Customers for these products
    include semiconductor wafer manufacturers and integrated circuit
    manufacturers (including those that produce chips and flat panel
    displays), which either use the integrated circuits they
    manufacture in their own products or sell them to other
    companies for use in advanced electronic components.

Integrated
    Circuit Manufacturing

Most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a
    variety of circuit components, such as transistors and other
    devices, that are connected by multiple layers of wiring
    (interconnects). As the density of the circuit components
    increases to enable greater computing power in the same or
    smaller area, the complexity of building the chip also
    increases, necessitating the formation of smaller structures and
    more intricate wiring schemes. To build a chip, the transistors,
    capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the
    surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to
    deposit and selectively remove successive film layers. Similar
    processes are then used to build the layers of wiring structures
    on the wafer. A typical, simplified process sequence for
    building the wiring portion of chips involves initially
    depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of
    circuit components using a chemical vapor deposition
    (CVD) system. An etch system is then used to create
    openings and patterns in the dielectric layer. To form the metal
    wiring, these openings and patterns are subsequently filled with
    conducting material using physical vapor deposition (PVD) and/or
    electrochemical plating (ECP) technologies. A chemical
    mechanical polishing (CMP) step then polishes the wafer to
    achieve a flat surface. Additional deposition, etch and CMP
    steps are then performed to build up the layers of wiring needed
    to complete the interconnection of the circuit elements to form
    the chip. Advanced chip designs require about 500 steps
    involving these and other processes to complete the
    manufacturing cycle.

Applied currently manufactures systems that perform most of the
    primary steps in the chip fabrication process, including: atomic
    layer deposition (ALD), CVD, PVD, ECP, etch, ion implantation,
    rapid thermal processing (RTP), CMP, wafer wet cleaning, wafer
    metrology and inspection, and systems that etch, measure and
    inspect



circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process.
    Applied also provides products and services to enhance
    integrated circuit manufacturing productivity and yield.

Most of Applied’s products are single-wafer systems with
    multiple process chambers attached to a base platform. Each
    wafer is processed separately in its own environment, allowing
    precise process control, while the system’s multiple
    chambers enable simultaneous, high productivity manufacturing.
    Applied sells most of its single-wafer, multi-chamber systems on
    four basic platforms: the Centura®, the Endura®, the
    Producer® and the Vantage®. These platforms currently
    support ALD, CVD, PVD, etch and RTP technologies.

Historically the semiconductor industry has migrated to
    increasingly larger wafers to build chips. The predominant wafer
    size used for volume production today is 200mm, or eight-inch,
    wafers, but a substantial number of new fabs being built use
    300mm, or

12-inch,

wafers to gain the economic advantages of a larger surface area.
    Applied offers a comprehensive line of systems and services to
    support 200mm and 300mm wafer processing.

A majority of process steps used in chipmaking are performed to
    build the interconnect, a complex matrix of microscopic wires
    that carry electrical signals to connect the transistor and
    capacitor components of a chip. Many customers have transitioned
    from using aluminum as the main conducting material for the
    interconnect to copper, which has lower resistance than aluminum
    and can carry more current in a smaller area. Applied is the
    leading supplier of systems for manufacturing copper-based
    chips, and supplies systems for depositing, etching and
    planarizing the copper interconnect layers. In 2005, Applied
    launched an enhanced PVD system for depositing the critical
    copper interconnect barrier-seed layers in next-generation chips.

Complementing the transition to copper to improve chip speed is
    the use of low dielectric constant (low k) films to replace
    silicon dioxide material as the insulator between the copper
    wiring structures. Applied leads the industry in providing low k
    dielectric systems to integrated circuit manufacturers and many
    of these customers are now using the Company’s Applied
    Black Diamond® film in volume production. Applied
    introduced its second-generation low k dielectric film this
    year, the Applied Producer Black Diamond II, which further
    reduces the dielectric constant to enhance the speed of
    customers’ 65 nanometer (nm) and below chip designs.

The transistor portion of the chip is another area in which
    integrated circuit manufacturers are advancing their device
    designs to improve speed. Applied introduced several new
    products during fiscal 2005 for building smaller and faster
    transistors, expanding its offerings in rapid thermal processing
    (RTP) and silicon etching.

Applied also uses similar technologies to manufacture and
    service equipment used to fabricate flat panel displays (FPDs)
    through its wholly-owned subsidiary, AKT, Inc. (AKT). These
    systems are used by FPD manufacturers to build and test thin
    film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels for
    televisions, computer displays and other applications.

Products

The following summarizes Applied’s portfolio of products
    and their associated process technology areas.

Deposition

Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating an integrated
    circuit. During deposition, a layer of dielectric (material used
    as insulation), barrier or electrically conductive (typically
    metal materials used to carry current) film is deposited or
    grown on a wafer. Applied currently provides equipment to
    perform the four main types of deposition: ALD, CVD, PVD and
    ECP. In addition, Applied’s RTP systems can be used to
    perform certain types of dielectric deposition.

Atomic
    Layer Deposition

ALD is an emerging technology in which single layers of atoms
    are used to build chip structures. This technology enables
    customers to deposit thin layers of either conducting or
    insulating material with uniform coverage in sub-nanometer sized
    areas. Applied offers ALD chambers for depositing tungsten and
    tantalum nitride films. The Applied Endura
    iCuBS

tm

product is the industry’s first system to integrate ALD and
    PVD chambers on a single platform for depositing critical
    barrier and seed layers in copper interconnects. The Applied
    Centura



iSprint

tm

Tungsten system (iSprint) combines an ALD chamber, which
    deposits a tungsten nucleation film, with a CVD tungsten bulk
    fill process in one system. The iSprint is used to form contact
    structures that connect the transistors to the wiring areas of
    the chip.

Chemical
    Vapor Deposition

CVD is used by customers to deposit dielectric and metal films
    on a wafer. During the CVD process, gases that contain atoms of
    the material to be deposited react on the wafer surface, forming
    a thin film of solid material. Films deposited by CVD may be
    silicon oxide, single-crystal epitaxial silicon, amorphous
    silicon, silicon nitride, dielectric anti-reflective coatings,
    low k dielectric (highly efficient insulating materials), high k
    dielectric (electrical charge-storing materials), aluminum,
    titanium, titanium nitride, polysilicon, tungsten, refractory
    metals or silicides. Applied offers the following CVD products
    and technologies:

The Applied Producer CVD system

— This
    high-throughput platform features Twin-Chamber modules that have
    two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up to three
    Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer platform,
    giving it a maximum simultaneous processing capacity of six
    wafers. Many dielectric CVD processes can be performed on this
    platform. The Applied Producer Advanced Patterning
    Film

tm

process is an innovative CVD hardmask film that enables
    customers to fabricate sub-50nm transistor gates and contact
    structures using standard lithography. The Applied Producer
    DARC® 193 deposits a dielectric anti-reflective coating
    that provides the precise dimensional control and compatibility
    needed for fabricating interconnects and transistors using
    advanced lithography methods.

The Applied Centura Ultima HDP-CVD®
    system

— High-density plasma CVD (HDP-CVD) is
    used to fill very small, deep spaces with dielectric film. One
    of the processes that can be performed on the system is
    fluorinated silicate glass (FSG), a film with higher insulating
    value than traditionally-used silicon dioxide material that
    enables faster chip performance. The Applied Centura Ultima
    HDP-CVD product is used by a number of major integrated circuit
    manufacturers for gap-fill applications, including the
    deposition of FSG in their advanced interconnect structures and
    deposition of silicon oxides in substrate isolation structures.

Low k Dielectric Films

— Many integrated
    circuit manufacturers are now incorporating new low k dielectric
    materials in their copper-based chip designs to further improve
    interconnect speed. The Applied Producer Black Diamond CVD low k
    system is being used by several customers in volume production
    to produce some of the industry’s most advanced devices.
    Using conventional CVD equipment, the Black Diamond product
    provides customers with a proven, cost-effective way to
    transition to this new material. In 2005, the Applied Producer
    Black Diamond II was introduced — a
    second-generation dielectric that provides a lower k-value film
    for building faster 65nm generation and below chip designs. A
    complementary low k dielectric film, called the Applied Producer
    BLOk

tm

(Barrier low k), enables the complete, multi-layer dielectric
    structure to benefit from low k technology.

Epitaxial Deposition

— Epitaxial silicon
    (epitaxy or epi) is a layer of pure silicon grown in a uniform
    crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high quality base
    for the device circuitry. Epi technology is used in an
    increasing number of integrated circuit devices in both the
    wafer substrate and transistor areas of a chip to enhance speed.
    The Applied Centura Epi system integrates pre- and post-epi
    processes on the same system to improve film quality and reduce
    production costs. This system is also being used for
    silicon-germanium epi technology, which can reduce power usage
    and increase speed in certain types of advanced chips. For
    emerging transistor designs, the Company’s Applied Centura
    RP Epi system offers selective epi processes to enable faster
    transistor switching without the need to shrink the scale of the
    device.

Polysilicon Deposition

— Polysilicon is a
    type of silicon used to form portions of the transistor
    structure within the integrated circuit device. The Applied
    Centura
    Polygen

tm

LPCVD (low pressure chemical vapor deposition) system is a
    single-wafer, multi-chamber product that deposits thin,
    polysilicon films at high temperatures to create transistor gate
    structures. To address the challenging requirements of 90nm and
    below devices, the Applied Centura DPN Gate Stack system
    integrates chambers for decoupled plasma nitridation (DPN), RTP
    anneal and polysilicon deposition on one platform to enable
    superior film quality and material properties.



Silicon Nitride Deposition

— The Applied
    Centura SiNgen®

Plus

LPCVD system is a single-wafer,
    high-temperature system that deposits silicon nitride films for
    transistor applications. This system minimizes the amount of
    time the wafer is exposed to high temperatures and reduces
    particles while improving operating cost and productivity in
    critical transistor nitride layers for 130nm and below devices.

Tungsten Deposition

— Tungsten is used in
    the contact area of a chip that connects the transistors to the
    wiring circuitry. In aluminum-based devices, tungsten is also
    used in the structures that connect the multiple layers of
    aluminum wiring. The Company has two products for depositing
    tungsten: the Applied Centura Sprint® Tungsten CVD system
    for 130nm and 90nm devices and the advanced Applied Centura
    iSprint ALD/CVD system for 65nm and below applications. The
    latter product combines ALD technology and CVD chambers on the
    same platform.

Physical
    Vapor Deposition

PVD, also called sputtering, is a physical process in which
    atoms of a gas, such as argon, are accelerated toward a metal
    target. The metal atoms chip off, or sputter away, and are then
    deposited on the wafer. The Applied Endura PVD system offers a
    broad range of advanced deposition processes, including
    aluminum, aluminum alloys, cobalt, titanium/titanium nitride,
    tantalum/tantalum nitride, tungsten/tungsten nitride, nickel,
    nickel vanadium and copper (Cu). The Applied Endura CuBS (copper
    barrier/seed) PVD system is widely used by customers for
    fabricating copper-based chips. Using PVD technology, the system
    deposits critical layers that prevent copper material from
    entering other areas of the device and primes the structure for
    the subsequent deposition of bulk copper by electrochemical
    plating. An enhanced version of the Applied Endura CuBS system
    was announced in August 2005 to enable precise filling of the
    extremely high aspect ratio features found in 65nm devices, with
    extendibility to 45nm chips and below.

The Applied Endura system’s highly flexible, multi-chamber
    architecture allows the integration of multiple PVD processes or
    combinations of metal CVD and PVD technologies on the same
    system. In addition to the integrated Applied Endura iCuBS
    ALD/PVD system (discussed in the Atomic Layer Deposition
    section), the Applied Endura
    iLB

tm

(integrated liner barrier) system combines a PVD chamber for
    depositing titanium with a CVD chamber for titanium nitride
    deposition to form critical lining layers of interconnect
    structures. These structures are subsequently filled with
    tungsten, aluminum or other materials.

Electrochemical
    Plating

Electrochemical plating is a process by which metal atoms from a
    chemical fluid (an electrolyte) are deposited on the surface of
    an immersed object. Its main application in the semiconductor
    industry is to deposit copper in interconnect wiring structures.
    This process step follows the deposition of barrier and seed
    layers which prevent the copper from contaminating other areas
    of the device and improve the adhesion of the copper film.

The Applied
    SlimCell

tm

ECP (electrochemical plating) system offers a small-volume cell
    design that allows independent bath chemistry for multi-step
    processing. The system enables a reduction in defect levels
    compared to conventional large bath systems while reducing
    chemical consumption.

Etch

Etching is used many times throughout the integrated circuit
    manufacturing process to selectively remove material from the
    surface of a wafer. Before etching begins, the wafer is coated
    with a light-sensitive film, called photoresist. A
    photolithography process then projects the circuit pattern onto
    the wafer. Etching removes material only from areas dictated by
    the photoresist pattern. Applied offers a full range of systems
    for etching dielectric, metal and silicon films to meet the
    requirements of sub-100nm processing.

For dielectric applications, the Applied Centura eMax®
    system etches a broad range of dielectric films in the contact
    and interconnect regions of the chip. Applied’s Producer
    Etch system utilizes the Twin-Chamber Producer platform concept
    to target cost-sensitive dielectric etch applications in 90nm
    and below design geometries. To address advanced low k etch
    applications, the Applied Centura Enabler® Etch system
    performs etch, strip and clean



steps in a single chamber. The Enabler’s

all-in-one

capability streamlines the process flow for 65nm and below chip
    designs and significantly reduces operating costs.

The Applied Centura Decoupled Plasma Source (DPS) Etch systems
    are used to etch conducting films, such as metal and silicon
    materials, and offer customers the technology, productivity and
    reliability required for 100nm and below processing. Extending
    the DPS technology to the next generation of silicon etching,
    the Applied Centura
    AdvantEdge

tm

system, launched in July 2005, offers chipmakers high precision
    gate etching for 65nm and 45nm-generation devices. The Applied
    Centura
    Transforma

tm

Etch patterning system combines silicon etch technology with
    integrated metrology capability to enable customers to improve
    process control, device yield and overall fab cycle time for
    building advanced transistor gate structures.

Ion
    Implantation

During ion implantation, silicon wafers are bombarded by a beam
    of ions, called dopants, that penetrate (or implant) the film
    surface to a desired depth. The implantation step is used during
    transistor fabrication to change electrical properties of a
    material and achieve a particular electrical performance.

Low-energy, high current implant technology is important to
    enabling the fabrication of smaller structures, which
    contributes to faster transistor performance. The Applied
    Quantum® X Implanter provides chipmakers with a
    production-worthy, single-wafer, high-current implanter that
    enables transistor scaling to the 65nm node and below. The
    Quantum X system’s high tilt capability, together with its
    precise energy control and low defect levels, deliver the
    process technology needed to achieve the most difficult and
    critical implants required for 65nm and 45nm advanced
    manufacturing.

Rapid
    Thermal Processing

RTP subjects a wafer to rapid bursts of intense heat that can
    take the wafer from room temperature to more than 1,000 degrees
    Celsius in less than 10 seconds. RTP is used mainly for
    modifying the properties of deposited films. The Applied Centura
    Radiance®

Plus

and Applied Vantage Radiance

Plus

RTP systems feature the same advanced RTP technology with
    differing platform designs. While the multi-chamber Centura
    platform offers exceptional process flexibility, the streamlined

2-chamber

Vantage
    platform is designed for dedicated high-volume manufacturing.
    These single-wafer RTP systems are also used for growing high
    quality oxide and oxynitride films, deposition steps that
    traditional large batch furnaces can no longer achieve with the
    necessary precision and control. For flash memory applications,
    the Company launched the Applied Vantage
    RadOx

tm

system, which deposits high-performance gate oxides with high
    productivity and low operating cost.

Chemical
    Mechanical Polishing

CMP removes material from a wafer to create a flat (planarized)
    surface. This process allows subsequent photolithography
    patterning steps to occur with greater accuracy and enables film
    layers to build with minimal height variations. The
    Company’s 200mm Applied Mirra® and Mirra Mesa®
    systems and 300mm Applied Reflexion® systems have led the
    industry in CMP technology with important features such as
    integrated cleaning, film measurement and process control
    capabilities. The Company’s 300mm Applied Reflexion LK
    Ecmp

tm

system features proprietary electro-chemical mechanical
    planarization technology to provide a high-performance,
    cost-effective and extendible solution for copper/low k
    interconnects at the 65nm node and below. The Ecmp system
    removes bulk copper at a high rate by electric charge, making it
    ideal for fragile ultra-low k films.

Metrology
    and Wafer Inspection

Applied offers several types of products that are used to
    measure and inspect the wafer during various stages of the
    fabrication process:

Critical
    Dimension and Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscopes
    (CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)

Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an electron beam to
    form images of microscopic features, or critical dimensions
    (CDs), of a integrated circuit wafer at extremely high
    magnification. Applied’s SEMs provide



customers with full automation, along with the high accuracy and
    sensitivity needed for measuring very small CDs. The Applied
    VeritySEM

tm

Metrology system uses proprietary SEM imaging technology to
    enable precise control of the lithography and etching processes.
    The VeritySEM measures transistor CDs with less than 5 angstrom
    precision — a requirement for 45nm device
    production — and incorporates automation and
    software advancements for significantly higher throughput in
    production. In February 2005, Applied introduced its OPC Check
    software for the VeritySEM system. Using OPC Check, the
    VeritySEM system performs automated qualification of OPC
    (optical proximity correction) — based chip
    designs, significantly reducing mask (see Mask Making, below)
    verification time over conventional manual methods.

DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (such as particles,
    scratches or residues) that are first located by a defect
    detection system and then classify the defects to identify their
    source. The high-throughput, fully automatic Applied
    SEMVision

tm

G2 Defect Analysis products enable customers to use this
    technology as an integral part of their production lines to
    analyze defects as small as 30nm with very high throughput. The
    Applied SEMVision G2 FIB integrates advanced defect review SEM
    capability with automated focused ion beam (FIB) technology in
    one system. The FIB provides a cross-sectional view of the
    defects reviewed by the SEM, enabling chipmakers to analyze the
    defects in minutes as part of their in-line review process.

Wafer
    Inspection

Using laser-based technology, defects can be detected on
    patterned wafers (wafers with printed circuit images) as they
    move between processing steps. Defects may include particles,
    open circuit lines, shorts between lines or other problems. The
    Applied
    ComPlus-2T

tm

Inspection system detects defects in devices with design rules
    of 90nm and below. Incorporating key advances in imaging
    technology, the system captures up to 50 percent more
    defects than the previous system with the high speed required
    for customers’ volume production lines. In June 2005, the
    Company announced its breakthrough entry into the large
    brightfield inspection market with the Applied
    UVision

tm

Inspection system, the industry’s first laser-based 3D
    brightfield tool. Utilizing multi-beam DUV laser illumination
    and high efficiency detectors, the UVision system uncovers
    critical defects on the wafer that have not been detected before
    by any other system, enabling customers to rapidly resolve
    performance-limiting defect issues and achieve greater chip
    yields.

Mask
    Making

Masks are used by photolithography systems to transfer
    microscopic circuit designs onto wafers. Since an imperfection
    in a mask may be replicated on the wafer, the mask must be
    virtually defect-free. Applied provides systems for etching,
    measuring and inspecting masks. The Applied Tetra II Mask etch
    system is based on the Company’s production-proven DPS
    wafer etch technology and is the industry’s most advanced
    etch tool for fabricating masks. The Applied RETicle SEM system,
    built on Applied’s proven CD-SEM platform, measures
    virtually all mask types with sub-1nm precision, meeting the
    requirements of the industry’s most advanced masks.

Flat
    Panel Display Manufacturing

Flat panel displays are manufactured using integrated circuit
    technologies similar to those for making chips. One significant
    difference is the vastly larger area of the substrate (panel).
    The panels can be in excess of 70 times larger in area than
    today’s largest wafers (300mm diameter). New generation FPD
    fabs are being built primarily for manufacturing large-area flat
    panel liquid crystal display (LCD) television screens.

Applied’s wholly-owned subsidiary AKT supplies
    plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) systems and electron beam array
    testers to FPD manufacturers. Applied offers a range of systems
    that can process and test different substrate sizes to meet the
    industry’s requirements for multiple FPD applications. In
    response to the growing demand for LCD televisions, Applied
    introduced its latest PECVD system in fiscal 2005, the eighth
    generation (Gen-8) AKT-50K
    PECVD

tm

,
    which addresses FPD fab requirements for substrates measuring
    approximately 2.2 meters by 2.4 meters. The system can
    process up to six

52-inch

TV screens per
    substrate, doubling the capacity of previous Gen-7 systems for
    the same screen size. Complementing its PECVD systems, AKT also
    offers electron beam test systems that test the substrates
    during production for defective pixels and other imperfections.



Customer
    Service and Support

Applied Global Services plays a critical role in the
    Company’s ability to continuously support its
    customers’ production requirements. Approximately 2,500
    trained customer engineers and process support engineers are
    deployed in more than a dozen countries. These engineers are
    usually located at or near customers’ fab sites and service
    over 18,000 installed Applied systems.

Backlog

Applied’s backlog decreased from $3.4 billion at
    October 31, 2004 to $2.6 billion at October 30,
    2005. Applied manufactures its systems based on order backlog
    and customer commitments. Backlog includes only orders for which
    written authorizations have been accepted and shipment dates
    within 12 months have been assigned or where shipment has
    occurred but revenue has not been recognized. In addition,
    backlog includes contractual service revenue and maintenance
    fees to be earned within the next 12 months. Backlog
    adjustments for fiscal 2005 totaled $205 million, which
    consisted of cancellations and currency and other adjustments.
    Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel orders prior
    to shipment, subject to possible cancellation penalties. Due to
    possible changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of
    orders, Applied’s backlog on any particular date is not
    necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding
    period. Delays in delivery schedules and/or a reduction of
    backlog during any particular period could have a material
    adverse effect on Applied’s business and results of
    operations.

Manufacturing,
    Raw Materials and Supplies

Applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of
    assembling various commercial and proprietary components into
    finished systems. Applied has significant manufacturing
    operations in Austin, Texas; Santa Clara, California; Horsham,
    England; and Rehovot, Israel. Manufacturing requires some raw
    materials, including a wide variety of mechanical and electrical
    components, to be manufactured to Applied’s specifications.
    Applied uses numerous companies to supply parts, components and
    subassemblies (parts) for the manufacture and support of its
    products. Although Applied makes reasonable efforts to assure
    that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, this
    is not always possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be
    obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of
    suppliers. Applied has sought, and will continue to seek, to
    minimize the risk of production and service interruptions and/or
    shortages of key parts by: (1) qualifying and selecting
    alternate suppliers for key parts; (2) monitoring the
    financial condition of key suppliers; (3) maintaining
    appropriate inventories of key parts; and (4) qualifying
    new parts on a timely basis.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s long-term growth strategy requires continued
    development of new manufacturing products for integrated circuit
    fabrication. Applied’s significant investment in research,
    development and engineering (RD&E) has generally enabled it
    to deliver new products and technologies before the emergence of
    strong demand, thus allowing customers to incorporate these
    products into their manufacturing plans at an early stage in the
    technology selection cycle. Applied works closely with its
    global customers to design systems and processes that meet their



planned technical and production requirements. Product
    development and engineering organizations are located primarily
    in the United States, as well as in the United Kingdom and
    Israel. In addition, Applied outsources certain RD&E
    activities, some of which are performed in other countries.
    Process support and customer demonstration laboratories are
    located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Israel.

Applied invested $921 million (21 percent of net
    sales) for fiscal 2003, $992 million (12 percent of
    net sales) for fiscal 2004 and $941 million (13 percent of
    net sales) for fiscal 2005 in RD&E for product development
    and engineering programs to create new product lines and improve
    existing technologies and products. Applied has spent an average
    of 16 percent of net sales on RD&E over the last five
    years. In addition to RD&E for specific product
    technologies, Applied maintains ongoing programs for automation
    control systems, materials research and environmental control
    that have applications to its products. In fiscal 2005, Applied
    focused on developing systems for customers’ new chip
    designs with 65nm and below geometries, including systems to
    enable faster and denser transistor and interconnect structures.

Marketing
    and Sales

Because of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied
    markets and sells its products worldwide through a direct sales
    force. For fiscal 2005, net sales to customers in each region as
    a percentage of Applied’s total net sales were: Taiwan
    23 percent, North America (primarily the United States) 21
    percent, Japan 20 percent, Korea 14 percent, Europe
    13 percent and Asia-Pacific (including China)
    9 percent. Applied’s business is usually not seasonal
    in nature, but it is cyclical, based on the capital equipment
    investment patterns of major integrated circuit manufacturers.
    These expenditure patterns are based on many factors, including
    anticipated market demand and pricing for integrated circuits,
    the development of new technologies, factory utilization and
    global and regional economic conditions.

During fiscal 2005, approximately 80 percent of
    Applied’s net sales were to regions outside of the United
    States. Managing Applied’s global operations presents
    challenges and involves uncertainties that may affect
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations. For further discussion, see “Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations — Trends, Risks and
    Uncertainties — Applied is exposed to the risks
    of operating a global business.”

Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and
    long-lived assets attributable to Applied’s geographic
    regions is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements. During fiscal 2003, two customers
    individually accounted for greater than 10 percent of net
    sales: net sales to Intel Corporation represented
    13 percent of Applied’s net sales and net sales to
    Samsung America, Inc. represented 12 percent of
    Applied’s net sales. During fiscal 2004, no individual
    customer accounted for more than 10 percent of
    Applied’s net sales. During 2005, Samsung America, Inc.
    accounted for 10 percent of Applied’s net sales.

Competition

The global semiconductor equipment industry is highly
    competitive and characterized by rapid technological
    advancements and demanding worldwide service requirements.
    Applied’s ability to compete primarily depends on its
    ability to commercialize its technology and continually improve
    its products, processes and services, as well as its ability to
    develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer
    requirements. Significant competitive factors for succeeding in
    the integrated circuit manufacturing equipment market include
    the product’s technical capability, productivity and
    cost-effectiveness, and the level of technical service and
    support. The importance of each of these factors varies
    depending on the specific customer’s needs, including
    considerations such as the customer’s process application,
    product requirements, timing of the purchase and particular
    circumstances of the purchasing decision. The pace of
    technological change is rapid, with customers continually moving
    to smaller critical dimensions and larger wafer sizes and
    adopting new materials for fabricating chips. Existing
    technology can sometimes be adapted to the new requirements, but
    some of these requirements may create the need for an entirely
    different technical approach. The rapid pace of technological
    change creates opportunities for existing competitors and
    startups, and can quickly diminish the value of existing
    technologies.

Substantial competition exists for each of Applied’s
    products. Competitors range from small companies that compete
    with a single product and/or in a single region to global
    companies with multiple lines of integrated circuit



manufacturing products. Management believes that Applied has a
    strong competitive position based on the ability of its products
    and services to continue to address customer requirements.
    Success for Applied requires a continued high level of
    investment in RD&E and in marketing, sales and customer
    support activities.

Patents
    and Licenses

Management believes that Applied’s competitive position is
    significantly dependent upon skills in research, development,
    engineering, manufacturing and marketing, and not just on its
    patent position. However, protection of Applied’s
    technological assets by obtaining and enforcing intellectual
    property rights, including patents, is important. Therefore,
    Applied’s practice is to file patent applications in the
    U.S. and other countries for inventions that Applied considers
    significant. Applied has a significant number of patents in the
    U.S. and other countries, and additional applications are
    pending for new developments. Although Applied does not consider
    its business materially dependent upon any one patent, the
    rights of Applied and the products made and sold under its
    patents taken as a whole, are a significant element of
    Applied’s business. In addition to patents, Applied also
    possesses other intellectual property, including trademarks,
    knowhow, trade secrets and copyrights.

Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements
    with other companies when management determines that it is in
    its best interest to do so. Applied pays royalties under
    existing patent license agreements for the use, in several of
    its products, of certain patented technologies that are licensed
    to Applied for the life of the patents. Applied also receives
    royalties from licenses granted to third parties. Royalties
    received from and paid to third parties have not been and are
    not expected to be material in relation to the consolidated
    results of operations.

In the normal course of business, Applied periodically receives
    and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In
    dealing with such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful
    for Applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights.
    However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights
    will be available to Applied on commercially reasonable terms.
    If Applied is not able to resolve a claim, negotiate a
    settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses on
    commercially reasonable terms and/or successfully prosecute or
    defend its position, Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected.

Environmental
    Matters

Two of Applied’s locations have been designated as
    environmental cleanup sites. In 1987, the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency designated one of the locations,
    in Santa Clara, California, as a Superfund site and named
    Applied as a “Responsible Party.” Cleanup activities
    at this site began in 1984 and were substantially completed in
    February 2002. The California Regional Water Quality Control
    Board has designated Applied as a “Discharger” with
    respect to another site in Sunnyvale, California. Applied was
    named a Discharger at the Sunnyvale site upon its acquisition of
    the property in 1997. The prior owners and operators of the site
    are responsible for performing cleanup and monitoring
    activities. Applied maintains a number of environmental, health
    and safety programs that are primarily preventive in nature. As
    part of these programs, Applied regularly monitors ongoing
    compliance and periodically conducts investigations of possible
    contamination. Neither compliance with federal, state and local
    provisions regulating discharge of materials into the
    environment, nor remedial agreements or other actions relating
    to the environment, has had, or is expected to have, a material
    effect on Applied’s capital expenditures, competitive
    position, financial condition or results of operations.

Employees

At October 30, 2005, Applied employed 12,576 regular
    employees and 348 temporary employees. In the high-technology
    industry, competition for highly-skilled employees is intense.
    Applied believes that its future success is highly dependent
    upon its continued ability to attract, retain and motivate
    qualified employees. There can be no assurance that Applied will
    be able to attract, hire, assimilate and retain a sufficient
    number of qualified employees.

    response to ongoing changes in the integrated circuit industry,
    Applied regularly assesses the size, capability and location of
    its global infrastructure and periodically makes adjustments
    accordingly.



Item 3:

Legal
    Proceedings

Linear
    Technology

On March 12, 2002, Linear Technology Corp. (LTC) filed a
    complaint against Applied in the Superior Court for the County
    of Santa Clara, captioned Linear Technology Corp. v. Applied
    Materials, Inc., Novellus Systems, Inc. and Tokyo Electron Ltd.
    (case no. CV806004), alleging claims for breach of
    contract, fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation,
    suppression of fact, unfair competition, breach of warranty,
    express contractual indemnity, implied equitable indemnity and
    declaratory relief. The complaint alleged, among other things,
    that Applied is obligated to indemnify and defend LTC for
    certain claims in an underlying patent infringement lawsuit
    brought by Texas Instruments, Inc. (TI) against LTC. On
    November 12, 2002, LTC filed an amended complaint in the
    Santa Clara action asserting essentially the same claims as in
    the original complaint, but adding an additional assertion that
    LTC and TI have settled their litigation. Applied’s motion
    to dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part. LTC filed
    a Second and Third Amended Complaint, each of which was
    dismissed upon Applied’s motion. On February 13, 2004,
    LTC filed a Fourth Amended Complaint, which Applied moved to
    dismiss. LTC then filed a motion to amend its Fourth Amended
    Complaint, which the Court granted. On July 7, 2004, LTC
    filed a Fifth Amended Complaint. On October 5, 2004,
    Applied’s motion to dismiss LTC’s Fifth Amended
    Complaint was granted with prejudice. On January 11, 2005,
    LTC filed a notice of appeal of the dismissal of its complaint.
    Applied believes it has meritorious defenses and intends to
    pursue them vigorously.

David
    Scharf

On July 31, 2001, David Scharf, an individual, filed a
    lawsuit against Applied in the United States District Court for
    the Central District of California, captioned David Scharf v.
    Applied Materials, Inc. (case

no. 01-06580

AHM).
    The lawsuit alleges that Applied has infringed, has induced
    others to infringe and has contributed to others’
    infringement of a patent concerning color synthesizing scanning
    electron microscope technology. Mr. Scharf seeks a
    preliminary and permanent injunction, a finding of willful
    infringement, damages (including treble damages), and costs.
    Applied has answered the complaint and counterclaimed for
    declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. On
    May 10, 2002, Mr. Scharf filed a request for
    re-examination of his patent with the Patent and Trademark
    Office (PTO). On June 26, 2002, the case was removed from
    the Court’s active docket after the parties stipulated to
    stay the case pending the results of that re-examination. On
    July 11, 2002, Applied filed its own request for
    re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with the PTO.
    Applied’s request for re-examination was granted on
    September 19, 2002. On April 23, 2004, the PTO
    notified Applied that it intended to issue a re-examination
    certificate. On June 14, 2004, Applied filed a second
    request for re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with
    the PTO. The second request was denied on September 1,
    2004. On October 1, 2004, Applied filed a petition for
    reconsideration of that denial, which subsequently was denied.
    Applied believes it has meritorious defenses and counterclaims
    and intends to pursue them vigorously.

Jusung

On December 24, 2003, Applied filed a lawsuit against
    Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. (Jusung Engineering) and Jusung
    Pacific Co., Ltd. (Jusung Pacific, referred to together with
    Jusung Engineering as Jusung) in Tao-Yuan District Court in
    Taiwan captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung
    Engineering Co., Ltd. (case no. 92 Tsai-chuan Tzi
    No. 6388). The lawsuit alleges that Jusung is infringing a
    patent related to chemical vapor deposition owned by Applied. In
    the suit, Applied seeks a provisional injunction prohibiting
    Jusung from importing, using, manufacturing, servicing or
    selling in Taiwan certain flat panel display manufacturing
    equipment. On December 25, 2003, the Tao-Yuan District
    Court ruled in favor of Applied’s request for a provisional
    injunction and, on January 14, 2004, the Court issued a
    provisional injunction order against Jusung Pacific. Jusung
    Pacific appealed those decisions, and the decisions were
    affirmed on appeal. On January 30, 2004, Jusung Pacific
    requested permission to post a counterbond to have the Jusung
    Pacific injunction lifted. Jusung Pacific’s counterbond
    request was granted and, on March 30, 2004, the provisional
    injunction order was lifted. At Applied’s request, on
    December 11, 2004, the District Court issued a provisional
    injunction order against Jusung Engineering. Jusung Engineering
    appealed that order, and the order was affirmed on appeal.
    Jusung Engineering also requested permission to post a
    counterbond to have the Jusung Engineering injunction lifted.
    Jusung Engineering’s counterbond request was granted, and,
    on April 25, 2005, the provisional injunction order against
    Jusung Engineering was lifted. Applied has



appealed both counterbond decisions. On June 30, 2004,
    Applied filed a “main action” patent infringement
    complaint against Jusung in the Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan
    captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung Engineering
    Co., Ltd. (case no. 93 Zhong Zhi No. 3). In the suit,
    Applied seeks damages and a permanent injunction for
    infringement of the same patent. The decisions regarding the
    provisional injunction and counterbond had no effect on the
    separate patent infringement lawsuit filed by Applied against
    Jusung in the Hsinchu Court. Applied believes it has meritorious
    claims and intends to pursue them vigorously.

Taiwan
    Fair Trade Commission

On April 10, 2004, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC)
    notified Applied’s subsidiary AKT in Taiwan that, pursuant
    to a complaint filed by Jusung, the TFTC had begun an
    investigation into whether AKT violated the Taiwan Fair Trade
    Act. The investigation focused on whether AKT violated the
    Taiwan Guidelines for the Review of Cases Involving Enterprises
    Issuing Warning Letters for Infringement on Copyright, Trademark
    and Patent Rights by allegedly notifying customers about
    AKT’s patent rights and the infringement of those rights by
    Jusung. On June 15, 2004, the TFTC notified Applied that
    Applied also was the subject of the investigation. By letter
    dated April 15, 2005, the TFTC notified Applied and AKT
    that there was insufficient evidence to support a claim against
    either company. Jusung has appealed the TFTC’s decision,
    and the appeal is pending. Although Applied agrees with the
    TFTC’s decision that there has been no violation, neither
    the extent nor the outcome of the appeal can be determined at
    this time.

Applied does not believe that the outcome of any of the above
    matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition or results of operations.

Other
    Legal Matters

From time to time, Applied receives notification from third
    parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking
    indemnification, litigation support, payment of money or other
    actions by Applied in connection with claims made against them.
    In addition, from time to time, Applied receives notification
    from third parties claiming that Applied may be or is infringing
    their intellectual property or other rights. Applied also is
    subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, both
    asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of
    business. Although the outcome of these claims and proceedings
    cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not believe
    that any of these other existing proceedings or claims will have
    a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial
    condition or results of operations.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Introduction

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended
    to facilitate an understanding of Applied’s business and
    results of operations. This MD&A should be read in
    conjunction with Applied’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included elsewhere in this report. MD&A consists
    of the following sections:

•

Overview:

a summary of Applied’s
    business, measurements and opportunities.

•

Results of Operations:

a discussion of
    operating results.

•

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
    Resources:

    of significant risks that could affect Applied’s financial
    condition and/or operating results.



Overview

Applied develops, manufactures, markets and services integrated
    circuit fabrication equipment for the global semiconductor and
    semiconductor-related industry. Product development and
    manufacturing activities occur in North America, the United
    Kingdom and Israel. Applied’s broad range of equipment and
    service products are highly technical and, as a result, are sold
    through a direct sales force. Customer demand for spare parts
    and services is fulfilled through a global spare parts
    distribution system and trained service engineers located around
    the world in close proximity to customer sites.

As a supplier to this industry, Applied’s results are
    primarily driven by worldwide demand for integrated circuits,
    which in turn depends on end-user demand for electronic
    products. The industry in which the Company operates is
    volatile. The downturn that began in fiscal 2001 and continued
    into fiscal 2003 constituted what management believes to be the
    longest and most severe downturn experienced by the industry. A
    recovery began in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 and
    continued into fiscal 2004. The growth peaked in the second half
    of 2004 and slowed thereafter through fiscal 2005.
    Applied’s results in fiscal 2003 through 2005 reflect the
    volatility of the industry.

The following table presents certain significant measurements of
    the past three fiscal years:

During fiscal 2003, lower sales volume and under absorption of
    manufacturing and service costs resulted in lower gross margins.
    In response to the continued difficult economic environment,
    Applied implemented a realignment plan in fiscal 2003, which
    concluded in the first fiscal quarter of 2004. Fiscal 2003
    operating results were negatively affected by lower net sales,
    reduced gross margins and charges related to realignment
    activities.

Operating results for fiscal 2004 reflected a recovery in the
    semiconductor industry and the global economy, as well as
    Applied’s realized savings from the completed realignment
    activities. In addition, Applied gained market share in critical
    areas, including 300mm equipment and copper interconnect,
    improved operational efficiencies, and further strengthened its
    cash position.

Fiscal 2005 results reflected a challenging environment as
    Applied’s customers decreased fab utilization globally and
    reduced or delayed capacity additions as a result of excess
    inventories and slowing demand for integrated circuits. During
    this period, Applied focused on lowering costs, improving
    efficiencies, reducing cycle time and bringing new products to
    market. Applied also generated strong cash flow, and returned
    value to stockholders by repurchasing stock and paying cash
    dividends.

Applied’s long-term opportunities depend in part on
    successful execution of its growth strategy, including
    increasing market share in existing markets, expanding into
    related markets, and cultivating new markets and new business
    models. These opportunities are also subject to many factors,
    including: (1) global economic conditions;
    (2) advanced technology and/or capacity requirements of
    integrated circuit manufacturers and their capital investment
    trends; (3) the profitability of integrated circuit
    manufacturers; (4) supply and demand for integrated
    circuits; (5) Applied’s investment in RD&E; and
    (6) the relative competitiveness of Applied’s
    equipment and service products. For this and other reasons set
    forth in the section entitled “Trends, Risks and
    Uncertainties,” Applied’s prior results of operations
    are not necessarily indicative of future operating results.



Results
    of Operations

Applied’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October of
    each year. Fiscal 2005 and 2003 each contained 52 weeks,
    whereas fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks. The first fiscal
    quarter of 2005 and 2003 each contained 13 weeks, whereas
    the first fiscal quarter of 2004 contained 14 weeks.

Net
    Sales

Applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry
    conditions in fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005. As a result of these
    conditions, there were significant fluctuations in
    Applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales, both within
    and across the fiscal years. Demand for integrated circuit
    manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a
    result of sudden changes in integrated circuit supply and demand
    and other factors, including rapid technological advances in
    integrated circuit fabrication processes.

From fiscal 2001 through the third quarter of 2003, slowing
    worldwide demand for integrated circuits resulted in a rapid
    decline in demand for integrated circuit manufacturing
    equipment. Inventory buildups in telecommunication products,
    slower than expected personal computer sales and slower global
    economic growth caused integrated circuit companies to reduce
    their capital spending and reschedule or cancel existing orders.
    The decline in demand further deepened into a severe industry
    downturn due to continued weakness in the macro-economic climate
    and reduced consumption of electronic products, which resulted
    in further capital spending cutbacks by Applied’s
    customers. However, beginning with the fourth fiscal quarter of
    2003 and continuing into fiscal 2004, customers increased their
    investments in capital equipment for capacity and technology,
    responding to higher spending for consumer electronics and
    business information technology and an increase in integrated
    circuit demand. The growth peaked in the second half of 2004 and
    slowed thereafter into fiscal 2005. As a result of excess
    inventories and slowing demand for integrated circuits,
    customers reduced production and delayed capacity additions in
    fiscal 2005.

New orders in the first half of 2003 declined to
    $1.0 billion per quarter, reflecting the continued and
    prolonged downturn in the integrated circuit industry. However,
    new orders increased during the second half of 2003, reflecting
    customers’ continued investments in advanced memory and
    logic and transition to 300mm, along with the increased capacity
    utilization in both advanced and established technologies.
    Following these new order trends, net sales decreased to
    approximately $1.1 billion for each of the first three
    fiscal quarters of 2003, reflecting the impact of the industry
    downturn. Net sales increased to $1.2 billion for the
    fourth fiscal quarter of 2003, indicating the beginning of an
    industry recovery. Net sales for fiscal 2003 were
    $4.5 billion.

New orders increased from $4.3 billion for fiscal 2003 to
    $9.0 billion for fiscal 2004, reflecting a broad-based
    increase in capital investment by both advanced memory and logic
    manufacturers for 300mm technology to meet rising demand for
    integrated circuits. Following the new order trends, net sales
    increased 79 percent from $4.5 billion for fiscal 2003
    to $8.0 billion for fiscal 2004, reflecting the fulfillment
    of higher levels of orders for capital equipment received in
    prior quarters to support customers’ manufacturing capacity
    expansion and new technology requirements.

New orders decreased 29 percent from $9.0 billion for
    fiscal 2004 to $6.4 billion for fiscal 2005, as integrated
    circuit manufacturers reduced their capital investments to bring
    inventories in line with demand. Following the trend of
    decreasing orders during fiscal 2005, net sales decreased by
    13 percent from $8.0 billion for fiscal 2004 to
    $7.0 billion for fiscal 2005, reflecting lower demand for
    integrated circuit products.

Realignment
    Activities

During fiscal 2003, in response to the continuing difficult
    business conditions, Applied implemented a series of activities
    to better align Applied’s cost structure with prevailing
    economic conditions. Realignment activities consisted of
    consolidation of facilities, reductions in workforce, and
    refocused product efforts. As a result of the



realignment activities, Applied vacated approximately two
    million square feet and reduced approximately 3,800 positions
    during fiscal 2003. Realignment activities resulted in charges
    across multiple categories, as incurred, including cost of
    products sold, RD&E expenses, and restructuring and asset
    impairment charges. During the first fiscal quarter of 2004,
    realignment activities were completed and reported as
    restructuring, asset impairments and other charges, as discussed
    below. There were no realignment charges during fiscal 2005.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales increased from
    35.8 percent for fiscal 2003 to 46.2 percent for
    fiscal 2004, and decreased to 44.1 percent for fiscal 2005.
    In fiscal 2000, Applied experienced unprecedented new order and
    revenue growth. Accordingly, Applied expanded its manufacturing
    facilities to accommodate anticipated growth. The lower business
    volume in fiscal 2001 through fiscal 2003, due to the industry
    downturn, was insufficient to fully absorb the overhead costs of
    these facilities, resulting in lower gross margins for all
    respective periods. The continued decline in gross margin for
    fiscal 2003 was principally attributable to under absorption of
    manufacturing and field service costs as a result of prolonged
    low business volumes, and inventory writeoffs and charges
    associated with refocused product efforts. The increase in gross
    margin from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was principally
    attributable to improved revenue levels, changes in product mix,
    decreased product costs, and increased manufacturing volume,
    resulting in higher absorption of manufacturing and field
    service costs and the completion of refocused product efforts
    discussed previously. The improvement in gross margin was
    partially offset by increased variable compensation costs as a
    result of improved operating performance. The decrease in gross
    margin from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was due to lower revenue
    levels, lower manufacturing absorption and changes in product
    mix, which were partially offset by initiatives for cost
    reduction and efficiency improvement, such as common platform
    architecture and parts, lower cost sourcing and cycle time
    reduction.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s future operating results depend, to a
    considerable extent, on its ability to maintain a competitive
    advantage in the products and services it provides. Applied
    believes that it is critical to continue to make substantial
    investments in RD&E to assure the availability of innovative
    technology that meets the current and projected requirements of
    its customers’ most advanced integrated circuit designs.
    Applied has historically maintained its commitment to investing
    in RD&E in order to continue to offer new products and
    technologies. As a result, RD&E expenses were
    $921 million (21 percent of net sales) for fiscal
    2003, $992 million (12 percent of net sales) for
    fiscal 2004 and $941 million (13 percent of net sales)
    for fiscal 2005. Development cycles range from 12 to
    36 months depending on whether the product is an
    enhancement of an existing product or a new product. Most of
    Applied’s existing products resulted from internal
    development activities and innovations involving new
    technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances,
    Applied acquires technologies either in its existing areas of
    development or through new product opportunities to complement
    its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to
    market.

In fiscal 2003, Applied refocused its product efforts and made
    investments in strategic products. Applied concentrated on the
    development of several important processing technologies to
    enable the production of chips using copper and low k dielectric
    materials, as well as to meet the challenges of smaller feature
    sizes, such as 65nm and below. In addition to interconnect
    solutions, Applied continued to invest resources in the
    development of systems for advanced transistor designs with
    smaller gate structures that enable faster signal propagation
    and reduced power. Applied also continued the development of its
    process diagnostic and control capabilities with systems to
    inspect and measure smaller dimensions and defects.

In fiscal 2004, Applied continued its investment in developing
    technologies for future generation manufacturing. Advances were
    made in several key areas, including technology for enhancing
    transistor and interconnect performance. Applied introduced ten
    major products in these areas, including the Endura2, Ecmp,
    Quantum X and G2 FIB systems, all targeted for 65nm and below
    chip manufacturing. In addition, Applied introduced the Gen7 AKT
    flat panel system.

In fiscal 2005, Applied focused on developing systems for
    customers’ advanced chip designs, including systems to
    enable smaller and faster interconnect and transistor structures
    with 65nm, 45nm and below geometries.



For copper interconnect applications, the Company introduced the
    Applied Endura CuB/S system with advanced copper barrier/seed
    technology and the Applied Producer Black Diamond II system
    for next-generation low k dielectric layers. For leading-edge
    transistor gate applications, Applied launched the Applied
    AdvantEdge Etch system and the Applied Vantage RadOx RTP. New
    applications in strain engineering, which involves creating
    localized areas of stress in the transistor structure, were also
    developed for existing systems to meet customers’
    requirements for faster transistors. In the area of inspection
    and metrology, Applied launched UVision, the industry’s
    first laser 3D brightfield inspection tool. The Applied OPC
    Check software is designed to automate critical OPC mask
    verification for customers. Applied’s AKT subsidiary
    developed the Gen-8 AKT-50K PECVD system for manufacturing flat
    panel displays. The system processes 2.2m x 2.4m glass
    substrates and doubles the capacity of previous

Gen-7

systems for
    producing

52-inch

LCD-TV

screens.

Marketing,
    Selling, General and Administrative

Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $626 million (14 percent of net sales) for fiscal
    2003, increased to $752 million (9 percent of net
    sales) for fiscal 2004, and decreased to $697 million
    (10 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2005. The increase
    from fiscal 2003 to 2004 correlated to the increase in business
    volume, as well as increases in variable compensation as a
    result of improved operating performance. The decrease from
    fiscal 2004 to 2005 was due to lower business volume, reductions
    in variable compensation and Applied’s continued focus on
    cost controls.

Restructuring,
    Asset Impairments and Other Charges

The restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2003 and 2004 were
    intended to better align Applied’s cost structure with
    prevailing market conditions due to the industry downturn at the
    time. These actions, which were necessary as a result of reduced
    business volume, reduced Applied’s global workforce and
    consolidated global facilities.

Restructuring, asset impairments and other charges for fiscal
    2003 totaled $372 million, consisting of $186 million
    for headcount reductions, $86 million for consolidation of
    facilities and $100 million for other costs, primarily
    fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidations.

Restructuring, asset impairments and other charges for fiscal
    2004 totaled $167 million, consisting of $65 million
    for facility consolidations, $6 million for severance and
    benefits, and $96 million for other costs, primarily fixed
    asset writeoffs due to facility consolidations.

As of October 30, 2005, the fiscal 2003 and 2004
    restructuring actions have been completed, and restructuring
    reserve balances consist principally of remaining lease
    commitments associated with facilities.

For further details, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Litigation
    Settlements, Net

Litigation settlements, net were $27 million for fiscal
    2004 and consisted of costs of $28 million related to two
    separate patent litigation settlements, net of a gain of
    $1 million related to a legal settlement in favor of
    Applied.

During fiscal 2003 or 2005, there were no significant litigation
    settlements.

Net
    Interest Income

Net interest income was $102 million for fiscal 2003,
    $66 million for fiscal 2004 and $134 million for
    fiscal 2005. The decrease in net interest income from fiscal
    2003 to 2004 was due primarily to lower average portfolio
    yields. The increase in net interest income in 2005 was due to a
    substantial increase in interest rates and a decrease in
    interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities in
    September 2004 and September 2005.

Income
    Taxes

Applied’s effective income tax provision/(benefit) rate was
    (29.5) percent for fiscal 2003, 26.1 percent for fiscal
    2004 and 23.5 percent for fiscal 2005. Applied’s
    effective tax rate of 26.1 percent for fiscal 2004 differed
    from (29.5 percent) for fiscal 2003 due to increased export
    tax benefits and foreign tax credits. Applied’s effective
    rate of



23.5 percent for fiscal 2005 differed from
    26.1 percent for fiscal 2004 primarily due to the favorable
    resolution of a multi-year Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax
    examination of $118 million and a change in estimate with
    respect to export tax benefits of $14 million, partially
    offset by a charge of $32 million relating to the
    distribution of foreign earnings under the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act). Applied’s
    future effective income tax rate depends on various factors,
    such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of
    Applied’s pre-tax income and non-tax deductible expenses
    incurred in connection with acquisitions. Management carefully
    monitors these factors and timely adjusts the effective income
    tax rate accordingly.

In October 2004, the United States Congress enacted the Jobs
    Creation Act which provides for a three year phase-out of
    current extraterritorial income tax (ETI) benefits and replaces
    ETI with a phased-in nine percent domestic production activity
    deduction that will not be fully effective until 2010. The Jobs
    Creation Act will not fully replace Applied’s current ETI
    tax benefits.

Business
    Combinations

On June 28, 2005, Applied purchased certain assets of SCP
    Global Technology, Inc. (SCP), consisting of single-wafer
    HF-last immersion technology and Marangoni clean/dry
    intellectual property, for approximately $24 million in
    cash.

On December 16, 2004, Applied acquired the assets of ATMI,
    Inc.’s Treatment Systems business (EcoSys), which supports
    the gas abatement requirements of process equipment for
    integrated circuit manufacturing and other industrial
    applications, for approximately $16 million in cash.

On December 14, 2004, Applied acquired substantially all of
    the operating subsidiaries and businesses of Metron Technology
    N.V. (Metron), a provider of a range of products and services
    for fab-wide operations and integrated circuit manufacturing
    equipment, for approximately $85 million in cash.

On June 14, 2004, Applied acquired Torrex Equipment
    Corporation, a developer of a multi-wafer system that utilizes
    chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition processes
    to address front-end semiconductor manufacturing applications,
    for $7 million in cash.

On April 18, 2003, Applied acquired Boxer Cross, Inc., a
    producer of in-line monitoring systems that provide customers
    with critical electrical measurement data for controlling
    semiconductor processes, for $14 million in cash.

    Financial Statements.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and
    Error Corrections — a Replacement of APB Opinion
    No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3” (SFAS 154),
    which requires retrospective application to prior periods’
    financial statements of every voluntary change in accounting
    principal unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS 154 is
    effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors
    beginning in fiscal 2007. Applied does not expect the adoption
    of this standard to have a material effect on Applied’s
    financial position or results of operations.

In March 2005, the SEC released SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107). SAB 107 provides
    the SEC staff position regarding the application of
    SFAS 123R, “Share-Based Payment.” SAB 107
    contains interpretive guidance relating to the interaction
    between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, as
    well as the staff’s views regarding the valuation of
    share-based payment arrangements for public companies.
    SAB 107 also highlights the importance of disclosures made
    related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions.
    Applied is currently evaluating SAB 107 and will be
    incorporating it as part of its adoption of SFAS 123R in
    the first fiscal quarter of 2006.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment,” which requires companies to
    measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based
    payments at fair value. In April 2005, the SEC extended the
    compliance requirement date of SFAS 123R, with the result
    that this requirement will be effective for Applied beginning
    with the first fiscal quarter of 2006. Applied is currently
    evaluating the expected impact of



SFAS 123R to its Consolidated Financial Statements. See
    Note 1 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements
    for information related to the pro forma effect on
    Applied’s reported net income and net earnings per share of
    applying the fair value provisions of the SFAS 123,
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,” to
    stock-based employee compensation.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
    Chapter 4,” (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 clarifies
    that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities,
    excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials
    (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period
    charges. SFAS 151 will be effective in fiscal years
    beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of
    SFAS 151 is not expected to have a material effect on
    Applied’s financial position or results of operations.

In March 2004, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
    reached a consensus on EITF Issue

No. 03-1,

“The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”

(EITF 03-1).

The
    guidance prescribes a three-step model for determining whether
    an investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on
    investments. The accounting guidance became effective for
    reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the
    disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting
    periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the
    FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)

EITF 03-1-1,

“Effective Date of

Paragraphs 10-20

of EITF Issue

No. 03-1

‘The
    Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (FSP

EITF 03-1-1).

FSP

EITF 03-1-1

delayed the effective date for the measurement and recognition
    guidance contained in

paragraphs 10-20

of EITF

Issue 03-1.

In
    November 2005, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 115-1

and

FAS 124-1,

“The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and its Application to Certain

other-than-temporary

Investments.” This FSP addresses the determination as to
    when an investment is considered impaired, whether the
    impairment is

other-than-temporary

and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement
    specifically nullifies the requirements of

paragraph 10-18

of

EITF 03-1

and
    references existing

other-than-temporary

impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective
    for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005.
    Applied continued to apply relevant

“other-than-temporary”

guidance as provided for in FSP

EITF 03-1-1

during
    fiscal 2005. Applied does not expect the implementation of FSP

FAS 115-1

and

FAS 124-1

will
    have a material effect on Applied’s financial position or
    results of operations.

Financial
    Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Applied’s cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
    decreased from $6.6 billion at October 31, 2004 to
    $5.9 billion at October 30, 2005 due primarily to
    repurchases and cash dividend distributions. Applied has not
    undertaken any significant external financing activities for
    several years.

Applied generated cash from operating activities of
    $855 million for fiscal 2003, $1.6 billion for fiscal
    2004 and $1.2 billion for fiscal 2005. The primary sources
    of cash from operating activities have been net income, as
    adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, and changes
    in working capital levels, including accounts receivable and
    inventories. Applied utilized programs to sell accounts
    receivable of $556 million for fiscal 2003,
    $859 million for fiscal 2004 and $158 million for
    fiscal 2005. The sales of these accounts receivable increased
    cash and reduced accounts receivable and days sales outstanding.
    Days sales outstanding were 68 days at the end of fiscal
    2003, compared to 69 days at the end of fiscal 2004 and
    85 days at the end of fiscal 2005. A portion of these sold
    accounts receivable is subject to certain limited recourse
    provisions. However, Applied has not experienced any losses
    under these programs Availability and usage of these accounts
    receivable sale agreements depend on many factors, including the
    willingness of financial institutions to purchase receivables
    and the cost of such arrangements. The increase in days sales
    outstanding in fiscal 2005 is primarily related to the change in
    the regional sales mix and the resulting relative decrease in
    the amount of sold accounts receivable. For further details
    regarding accounts receivable sales, see Note 11 of Notes
    to Consolidated Financial Statements. Inventories decreased by
    $105 million in fiscal 2005, which corresponds to the
    decrease in business volume and sales activity from fiscal 2004
    to fiscal 2005.

Applied used $1.1 billion of cash for investing activities
    for fiscal 2003, $534 million for fiscal 2004, and
    $179 million for fiscal 2005. Capital expenditures were
    $265 million for fiscal 2003, $191 million for fiscal
    2004, and $200 million for fiscal 2005, totaling
    $656 million for the past three years. Application
    laboratories, equipment and related facilities have comprised
    the majority of the capital spending. Fiscal 2003 capital
    expenditures also



included $52 million for the purchase of facilities in
    Hillsboro, Oregon that were previously held under a synthetic
    lease. Fiscal 2004 capital expenditures consisted principally of
    laboratory and demonstration equipment. Fiscal 2005 capital
    expenditures included investment in laboratory equipment and
    upgrades to Applied’s enterprise resource planning software
    and network architecture. Investing activities also included
    purchases and sales of short-term investments and acquisitions
    of technology or companies to allow Applied to access new market
    opportunities or emerging technologies. During fiscal 2005,
    Applied paid $102 million, net of cash acquired, for the
    Metron and EcoSys acquisitions, as discussed in Note 13 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Applied generated cash of $8 million from financing
    activities for fiscal 2003, used cash of $359 million for
    fiscal 2004 and used cash for $1.6 billion for 2005.
    Financing activities included issuances and repurchases of
    common stock and payment of dividends. Since March 1996, Applied
    has systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the
    open market to partially fund its stock-based employee benefit
    and incentive plans. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled
    $250 million for fiscal 2003, $650 million for fiscal
    2004 and $1.7 billion for fiscal 2005. Beginning in the
    second fiscal quarter of 2005, Applied’s Board of Directors
    declared three consecutive quarterly cash dividends, in the
    amount of $0.03 per share per declaration. The first two
    declared cash dividends totaling $98 million were paid
    during fiscal 2005. The declaration of any future cash dividend
    is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend
    on the Company’s financial condition, results of
    operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other
    factors. Financing activities also included borrowings and
    repayments of debt. Applied did not borrow any cash in fiscal
    years 2003, 2004 or 2005. Cash used for debt repayments totaled
    $64 million for fiscal 2003, $105 million for fiscal
    2004 and $62 million for fiscal 2005. Cash generated from
    issuances of common stock pursuant to Applied’s equity
    compensation programs totaled $323 million for fiscal 2003,
    $397 million for fiscal 2004 and $266 million for
    fiscal 2005.

Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing
    and extent of factors such as those discussed above,
    Applied’s management believes that cash generated from
    operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing
    cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to
    satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next
    12 months. For further details regarding Applied’s
    operating, investing and financing activities for each of the
    three years in the period ended October 30, 2005, see the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 30, 2005, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee agreements was
    approximately $60 million. Applied has not recorded any
    liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond
    that required to appropriately account for the underlying
    transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on
    historical experience and information currently available, that
    it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid
    under these guarantee arrangements.

In 2001, Applied formed Applied Materials Ventures I, L.P.
    (the Fund) to invest in privately-held, early-stage companies
    engaged in developing systems, components and devices based on
    nanotechnology and/or communications technology for specific
    applications and products. The Fund was a limited partnership,
    with Applied as the sole limited partner and an independent
    party as the general partner. During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2004, Applied exercised its right to limit capital
    contributions to the Fund to $25 million and to elect to
    terminate the partnership. As a result, under the provisions of
    the partnership agreement, the activities of the partnership
    concluded and the partnership was dissolved in March 2005.
    Applied’s cumulative capital contributions to the Fund
    totaled approximately $23 million through October 31,
    2004 and $24 million through October 30, 2005. The
    Fund’s assets, which primarily consisted of shares of
    portfolio companies, were distributed between Applied and the
    general partner during fiscal 2005. See Note 14 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements for further details on the
    Fund.

Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total
    rental expense for operating leases was $134 million for
    fiscal 2003, $88 million for fiscal 2004 and
    $87 million for fiscal 2005.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related
    disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
    amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in
    the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
    Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered
    to be critical accounting policies, as defined below.

A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both
    material to the presentation of Applied’s consolidated
    financial statements and requires management to make difficult,
    subjective or complex judgments that could have a material
    effect on Applied’s financial condition or results of
    operations. Specifically, these policies have the following
    attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions
    about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the
    estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could
    reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are
    reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on
    Applied’s financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects
    cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates
    on historical experience and on various other assumptions
    believed to be applicable and reasonable under the
    circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur,
    as additional information is obtained and as Applied’s
    operating environment changes. These changes have historically
    been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management
    is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which
    are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged
    periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the
    section below entitled “Trends, Risks and
    Uncertainties.” Based on a critical assessment of its
    accounting policies and the underlying judgments and
    uncertainties affecting the application of those policies,
    management believes that Applied’s consolidated financial
    statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
    and provide a meaningful presentation of Applied’s
    financial condition and results of operations.

Management believes that the following are critical accounting
    policies:

Warranty
    Costs

Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue
    is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by
    analyzing specific product and historical configuration
    statistics and regional warranty support costs.



Applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and
    component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred
    in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As
    Applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers
    are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is
    a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity
    and availability of critical replacement parts is another
    significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen
    component failures or exceptional component performance can also
    result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs
    differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to
    the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could
    have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Inventory
    Valuation

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market,
    with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The
    carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated
    obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the
    estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
    demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for
    potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing
    historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are
    evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known
    and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If
    actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated,
    additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete
    inventory might be required, which could have a material adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also
    reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually
    for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology,
    are generally recorded in connection with a business
    acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually
    based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the
    success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If
    actual product acceptance differs significantly from the
    estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment
    charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. The fair
    value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market
    multiples approach, and is dependent on market values for
    companies in a similar industry. A severe decline in market
    value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for
    impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Income
    Taxes

Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax
    assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect
    of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of
    recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also
    reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not
    that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
    Management has determined that it is more likely than not that
    its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its
    deferred tax assets.

The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
    composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing
    each region, non-tax deductible expenses incurred in connection
    with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management
    carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the
    effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results
    differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record
    a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its
    effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment
    in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of
    complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
    inconsistent with Applied’s expectations could have a
    material impact on Applied’s results of operations and
    financial condition.

Legal
    Matters

Applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims,
    either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course
    of business. Applied evaluates, among other factors, the degree
    of probability of an unfavorable



outcome and reasonably estimates the amount of the loss.
    Significant judgment is required in both the determination of
    the probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably
    estimated. When Applied determines that it is probable that a
    loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable,
    the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
    Although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with
    certainty, Applied does not believe that any of the existing
    legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its
    financial condition or results of operations. However,
    significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the
    factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have
    a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Trends,
    Risks and Uncertainties

The
    industry that Applied serves is volatile and
    unpredictable.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor and
    semiconductor-related industry, Applied is subject to the
    industry’s business cycles, the timing, length and
    volatility of which are difficult to predict. The industry has
    historically been cyclical due to sudden changes in demand for
    integrated circuits and manufacturing capacity, including
    capacity using the latest technology. The effect on Applied of
    these changes in demand, including end-customer demand, is
    occurring more rapidly, exacerbating the volatility of these
    cycles. These changes have affected the timing and amounts of
    customers’ capital equipment purchases and investments in
    technology, and continue to affect Applied’s orders, net
    sales, gross margin and results of operations.

Applied must effectively manage its resources and production
    capacity to meet changing demand. During periods of decreasing
    demand for integrated circuit manufacturing equipment, Applied
    must be able to appropriately align its cost structure with
    prevailing market conditions, effectively motivate and retain
    key employees, and effectively manage its supply chain. During
    periods of increasing demand, Applied must have sufficient
    manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand and
    must be able to attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number
    of qualified individuals and effectively manage its supply
    chain. If Applied is not able to timely and appropriately align
    its cost structure with business conditions and/or to
    effectively manage its resources and production capacity,
    including its supply chain during changes in demand,
    Applied’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the
    industry.

The industry is characterized by ongoing changes, including:
    (1) changes in customers’ capacity requirements,
    capacity utilization and capital spending, which depend in part
    on the demand for customers’ products and customers’
    inventory levels relative to demand; (2) the importance of
    reducing the cost of system ownership, due in part to the
    increasing significance of consumer electronics as a driver for
    integrated circuit demand and the related focus on lower prices;
    (3) varying levels of business information technology
    spending; (4) increasingly complex technology requirements,
    including a significant rise in the number and importance of new
    materials; (5) the growing types and varieties of
    integrated circuits and applications; (6) an expanding
    number of applications across multiple substrate sizes,
    resulting in divergent demands among integrated circuit
    manufacturers; (7) customers’ varying adoption rates
    of new technology; (8) a rising percentage of business from
    customers in Asia and the emergence of customers, competitors
    and suppliers in new geographical regions; (9) customer
    demands for shorter lead times for the manufacture and
    installation of integrated circuit manufacturing equipment;
    (10) the heightened importance to customers of system
    reliability and productivity; (11) the effect on system
    demand as a result of the increasing productivity and
    reliability of integrated circuit manufacturing equipment;
    (12) the increasing pace of changes in the mix of
    investments by customers in integrated circuit manufacturing
    equipment; (13) customers’ increasing use of
    partnerships, alliances, joint ventures and industry consortia
    that has increased the influence of key integrated circuit
    manufacturers in technology decisions made by their global
    partners; (14) higher capital requirements for new
    integrated circuit fabrication plants; (15) the rising
    importance of speed of product development and

time-to-market;

(16) the increasing difficulty for customers to move from
    product design to volume manufacturing; (17) the challenge
    to customers of moving volume manufacturing from one technology
    node to the next smaller technology node; (18) the rate of
    growth in the industry; (19) a heightening concern among
    certain U.S. governmental agencies regarding possible national
    commercial and/or security issues posed by the growing
    manufacturing business in Asia, especially China; (20) the
    need to effectively manage a growing number of



existing and new products in more varied competitive
    environments; and (21) the increasing importance of
    operating flexibility to enable different responses to different
    markets, customers and applications. These changes, individually
    or in combination, are increasing the need for customer
    partnering, use of foundries, collaborative research and
    development efforts, and process integration support. Certain of
    these changes also heighten the importance of spare parts and
    service product offerings as a competitive advantage for
    integrated circuit equipment manufacturers, even though service
    products typically result in lower gross margins than system
    products. In response to these ongoing changes, Applied must
    regularly reassess the size, capability and location of its
    global infrastructure. If Applied does not successfully manage
    the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the
    industry, its business, financial condition and results of
    operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    operates in a highly competitive industry characterized by
    increasingly rapid technological changes.

As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment,
    Applied’s future success heavily depends on effective
    development, commercialization and customer acceptance of its
    new equipment, service and related products. In addition,
    Applied must successfully execute its growth strategy, including
    increasing market share in existing markets, expanding into
    related markets, and cultivating new markets and new business
    models, while constantly improving its operational performance.
    Applied’s success is subject to many risks, including, but
    not limited to, its ability to timely and cost-effectively:
    (1) develop and market new products and price products
    appropriately; (2) improve existing products and increase
    market share in its existing markets; (3) expand into or
    develop related and new markets for its technology;
    (4) achieve market acceptance of, and accurately forecast
    demand and meet production schedules for, its products;
    (5) achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;
    (6) adapt to technology changes in related markets, such as
    lithography; (7) adapt to changes in value offered by
    companies in different parts of the supply chain;
    (8) qualify products for volume manufacturing with its
    customers; and (9) successfully implement improvements in
    its manufacturing process. The development, introduction and
    support of an increasingly broad set of products, including
    those enabling the transition to smaller device feature sizes
    and incorporation of new materials, have grown increasingly
    complex and expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved
    products may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies
    compared to Applied’s more established products and could
    adversely affect Applied’s gross margins. In addition,
    Applied must successfully implement changes in its design
    engineering methodology, including changes that result in:
    significant decreases in material costs and cycle time; greater
    commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different
    systems; and effective product life cycle management. If Applied
    does not successfully manage these challenges, its business,
    financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to the risks of operating a global
    business.

In fiscal 2005, approximately 80 percent of Applied’s
    net sales were to regions outside the United States. Certain
    manufacturing facilities and suppliers of Applied are also
    located outside the United States. Managing Applied’s
    global operations presents challenges including, but not limited
    to, those arising from: (1) varying regional and
    geopolitical business conditions and demands; (2) global
    trade issues; (3) variations in protection of intellectual
    property and other legal rights in different countries;
    (4) rising raw material and energy costs;
    (5) variations in the ability to develop relationships with
    suppliers and other local businesses; (6) changes in laws
    and regulations of the United States (including export
    restrictions) and other countries, as well as their
    interpretation and application; (7) fluctuations in
    interest rates and currency exchange rates; (8) the need to
    provide sufficient levels of technical support in different
    locations; (9) political instability, natural disasters
    (such as earthquakes, hurricanes or floods), pandemics,
    terrorism or acts of war where Applied has operations, suppliers
    or sales; (10) cultural differences; (11) special
    government-supported efforts to promote local integrated circuit
    manufacturing equipment companies; and (12) shipping
    delays. Many of these challenges are present in China, a large
    potential market for integrated circuit equipment and an area
    that Applied anticipates will continue to present a significant
    opportunity for growth over the long term. China is also
    experiencing significant growth of suppliers and potential
    competitors to Applied. These challenges, as well as global
    uncertainties with respect to: (1) economic growth rates in
    various countries; (2) consumer confidence; (3) the
    sustainability, timing, rate and amount of demand for
    electronics products and integrated circuits; (4) capital
    spending by integrated circuit manufacturers;



and (5) price trends for certain integrated circuit
    devices, may materially and adversely affect Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated
    customer base.

Applied’s customer base is and has been highly
    concentrated. Orders from a relatively limited number of
    manufacturers of integrated circuits have accounted for, and
    likely will continue to account for, a substantial portion of
    Applied’s net sales. In addition, the mix and type of
    customers, and sales to any single customer, may vary
    significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. If
    customers do not place orders, or delay or cancel orders,
    Applied may not be able to replace the business. As
    Applied’s products are configured to customer
    specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may
    result in significant non-recoverable costs. Major customers may
    also seek and on occasion receive pricing, payment terms or
    other conditions that are less favorable to Applied. In
    addition, certain customers have formed strategic alliances or
    collaborative efforts that result in additional complexities in
    managing individual customer relationships and transactions.
    These factors could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

The
    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital
    to Applied’s success.

Applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part
    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.
    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,
    including fluctuations in global economic and industry
    conditions, changes in Applied’s management or leadership,
    the effectiveness of Applied’s compensation programs,
    including its equity-based programs, and competitors’
    hiring practices. Applied has made adjustments to its equity
    compensation programs, such as implementation of a broad-based
    program providing for grants of restricted stock units (referred
    to as “performance shares” in the Applied Materials,
    Inc. Employee Stock Incentive Plan) beginning in fiscal 2006.
    These changes, as well as other changes in compensation
    practices or employee benefit programs, may reduce the
    effectiveness of the equity compensation programs as incentives
    to employees and/or may be disruptive to operations. Beginning
    in its first fiscal quarter of 2006, Applied will record a
    charge to earnings for equity-based compensation, such as stock
    options and restricted stock units (performance shares), in
    accordance with SFAS 123R. This requirement reduces the
    attractiveness of granting equity-based compensation as the
    expense associated with these grants will decrease
    Applied’s profitability. If Applied does not successfully
    attract, retain and motivate key employees as a result of these
    or other factors, Applied’s operating results and ability
    to capitalize on its opportunities may be materially and
    adversely affected.

Manufacturing
    interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to
    meet customer demand, while the failure to estimate customer
    demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete
    inventory.

Applied’s business depends on its ability to supply
    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly
    changing requirements of its customers, which depends in part on
    the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies
    (collectively, parts) from suppliers. Some key parts may be
    obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of
    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by
    suppliers in developing regions, including China. Additionally,
    Applied plans to transition to a single-vendor enterprise
    resource planning (ERP) software system to perform various
    functions, including order management and manufacturing control.
    Significant interruptions of manufacturing operations or the
    delivery of services as a result of (1) the failure or
    inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality parts;
    (2) volatility in the availability and cost of materials;
    (3) difficulties or delays in obtaining required export
    approvals; (4) information technology or infrastructure
    failures; (5) difficulties in implementing the ERP system;
    (6) natural disasters (such as earthquakes, hurricanes or
    floods); or (7) other causes (such as regional economic
    downturns, epidemics, political instability, terrorism or acts
    of war), could result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing
    inefficiencies, increased costs or order cancellations.
    Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is
    different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts
    than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or
    expediting delivery of parts. Any or all of these factors could
    materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.



The
    failure to successfully implement outsourcing activities could
    adversely affect results of operations.

To better align costs with market conditions and to increase
    productivity and operational efficiency, Applied outsources
    certain functions to third parties, including companies in
    India, China and other countries. These functions include
    engineering, manufacturing, customer support, software
    development and administrative activities. The expanding role of
    third party providers has required changes to Applied’s
    existing operations and the adoption of new procedures and
    processes for retaining and managing these providers in order to
    protect its intellectual property. If Applied does not
    effectively develop and implement its outsourcing strategy, if
    required export approvals are not timely obtained, or if third
    party providers do not perform as anticipated, Applied may not
    realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may
    experience operational difficulties, increased costs,
    manufacturing interruptions or delays and/or loss of its
    intellectual property rights, which could materially and
    adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition
    and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions.

Applied has made, and may in the future make, acquisitions of,
    or significant investments in, businesses with complementary or
    aligned products, services and/or technologies. Acquisitions
    involve numerous risks, including but not limited to:
    (1) diversion of management’s attention from other
    operational matters; (2) inability to complete acquisitions
    as anticipated or at all; (3) inability to realize
    synergies expected to result from an acquisition;
    (4) failure to commercialize purchased technologies;
    (5) ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal
    controls; (6) impairment of acquired intangible assets as a
    result of technological advancements or

worse-than-expected

performance of the acquired company or its product offerings;
    (7) unknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments
    or liabilities; (8) failure to integrate and retain key
    employees; and (9) ineffective integration of operations.
    Mergers and acquisitions are inherently subject to significant
    risks, and the inability to effectively manage these risks could
    materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or
    claims and protection of intellectual property
    rights.

Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved
    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,
    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental
    regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product
    liability, unfair competition, employment and other matters. In
    addition, Applied on occasion receives notification from
    customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or
    other obligations related to claims made against customers by
    third parties. These legal proceedings and claims, whether with
    or without merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to
    prosecute or defend and divert management’s attention and
    resources. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of
    current or future legal proceedings or claims. Applied
    previously entered into a mutual covenant-not-to-sue arrangement
    with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent
    infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be no assurance
    that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved
    or that Applied will be able to adequately protect its
    intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated
    with such a covenant. In addition, Applied’s success
    depends in part on the protection of its intellectual property
    and other rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a
    third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of
    equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost
    market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Applied’s
    intellectual property rights may not provide significant
    competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated,
    rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or
    if Applied does not adequately assert these rights. Furthermore,
    the laws of other countries, including China, permit the
    protection and enforcement of Applied’s rights to varying
    extents, which may not be sufficient to protect Applied’s
    rights. If Applied is not able to resolve a claim, negotiate a
    settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses on
    commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute or
    defend its position, Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected.

Changes
    in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect future
    results.

As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the
    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment
    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
    Applied’s future tax rates



could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in
    countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of
    Applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes
    in the tax laws. For example, U.S. legislation governing
    taxation of extraterritorial income (ETI) repealed certain
    export subsidies that were prohibited by the World Trade
    Organization and enacted different tax provisions. These tax
    provisions will not fully offset the loss of the repealed tax
    provisions and, as a result, Applied’s U.S. tax liability
    may increase. In addition, Applied is subject to regular
    examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue
    Service and other tax authorities. Applied regularly assesses
    the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting
    from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its
    provision for income taxes. Although Applied believes its tax
    estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any
    final determination will not be materially different from the
    treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax
    provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely
    affect Applied’s results of operations.

Applied
    is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation
    requirements of Section 404 of the

Sarbanes-Oxley

Act.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the

Sarbanes-Oxley

Act of
    2002, Applied’s management must perform evaluations of
    Applied’s internal control over financial reporting.
    Beginning as of the end of fiscal 2005 and annually thereafter,
    Applied’s

Form 10-K

must
    include a report of its management’s assessment of the
    adequacy of such internal control, and Applied’s
    independent registered public accounting firm must publicly
    attest to the adequacy of management’s assessment and the
    effectiveness of Applied’s internal control. Ongoing
    compliance with these requirements is complex, costly and
    time-consuming. If Applied fails to maintain an effective
    internal control over financial reporting, if Applied’s
    management does not timely assess the adequacy of such internal
    control, or if Applied’s independent registered public
    accounting firm does not timely attest to the evaluation,
    Applied could be subject to regulatory sanctions and the
    public’s perception of Applied may decline.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with expanded service product
    offerings and strategic transactions.

In order to improve customers’ manufacturing productivity
    and efficiency and as part of its growth strategy, Applied is
    expanding its service product offerings for both Applied and
    non-Applied products. These new service products, which include

on-site

support as well
    as supply chain and spare parts management, are offered in part
    through strategic relationships and alliances formed with, or
    acquisitions of, other suppliers to the semiconductor industry.
    In order to develop this market opportunity, Applied must
    cultivate new business models, form and maintain strategic
    relationships with appropriate companies, achieve customer
    acceptance, and successfully and cost-effectively provide these
    service products. Applied’s inability to achieve any of the
    foregoing could have a material adverse effect on its business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and
    safety regulations.

Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in
    connection with its global business operations, including, but
    not limited to, regulations related to the development,
    manufacture and use of its products, the operation of its
    facilities, and the use of its real property. Failure or
    inability to comply with existing or future environmental and
    safety regulations could result in significant remediation
    liabilities, the imposition of fines and/or the suspension or
    termination of development, manufacture or use of certain of its
    products, or may affect the operation of its facilities or use
    of its real property, each of which could have a material
    adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition
    and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory
    environment.

Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,
    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and
    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies and/or
    regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates
    and with which Applied must comply; (2) disagreements or
    disputes between national or regional regulatory agencies
    related to international trade; and (3) the interpretation
    and application of laws, rules and regulations. If Applied is
    found by a court or regulatory agency not to be in compliance
    with applicable laws, rules or regulations, Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.



Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

At October 30, 2005, Applied’s investment portfolio
    included fixed-income securities with a fair value of
    approximately $5.6 billion. Applied’s primary
    objective for investing in fixed-income securities is to
    preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk.
    These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will
    decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on
    Applied’s investment portfolio at October 30, 2005 and
    October 31, 2004, an immediate 100 basis point increase in
    interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of
    the portfolio of approximately $65 million and
    $49 million, respectively. While an increase in interest
    rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio,
    Applied will not realize the losses in the Consolidated
    Statement of Operations unless the individual fixed-income
    securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined
    to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

Applied’s long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates. As
    such, Applied’s interest expense would increase only to the
    extent that Applied significantly increased the amount of
    variable rate obligations outstanding. Due to the short-term
    nature and relatively low amount of Applied’s variable rate
    obligations, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest
    rates would not be expected to have a material effect on
    Applied’s near-term financial condition or results of
    operations.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign
    currencies, such as Japanese yen, British pound, euro and
    Israeli shekel. Applied enters into forward exchange and
    currency option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all,
    existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated
    transactions expected to occur within 12 months. Gains and
    losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that the
    related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the
    effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward
    exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the
    related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these
    financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to
    risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency
    exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign
    currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on
    Applied’s results of operations for fiscal 2003, 2004 or
    2005.

Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency
    as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen, British
    pound, euro and Israeli shekel), and the terms of the forward
    exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying
    transactions. Applied’s outstanding forward exchange
    contracts are

marked-to-market

(see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements),
    as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being
    hedged; therefore, the effect of exchange rate changes on
    forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially
    offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying
    transactions. The effect of an immediate 10 percent change in
    exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying
    hedged transactions is not expected to be material to
    Applied’s near-term financial condition or results of
    operations. Applied’s risk with respect to currency option
    contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to
    exercise the option. Premiums paid for options outstanding at
    October 30, 2005 were not material.

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As
    of the end of the period covered by this report, management of
    Applied conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with
    the participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of Applied’s disclosure controls



and procedures, as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of
    the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, Applied’s
    Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
    that Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures were
    effective as of the end of the period covered by this report in
    ensuring that information required to be disclosed was recorded,
    processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
    specified in the SEC’s rules and forms.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting.

Applied’s
    management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of
    the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, management of Applied conducted an
    evaluation of the effectiveness of Applied’s internal
    control over financial reporting based upon the framework in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, Applied’s
    management concluded that Applied’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of October 30, 2005.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
    audited the consolidated financial statements included in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and, as
    part of the audit, has issued a report, included herein, on
    (1) Applied’s management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of Applied’s internal control over financial
    reporting and (2) the effectiveness of Applied’s
    internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

There were no changes in the
    internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected Applied’s internal control over financial
    reporting during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005.

Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
    and Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting

.

It should be noted that any
    system of controls, however well designed and operated, can
    provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the
    objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of
    any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions
    about the likelihood of future events.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
    Stockholders and Board of Directors Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting in Item 9A: Controls and Procedures,
    that Applied Materials, Inc. maintained effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of October 30, 2005,
    based on the criteria established in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). Applied Materials, Inc.’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Applied
    Materials, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of October 30, 2005, is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on criteria established
    in “Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework” issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Applied
    Materials, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of October 30,
    2005, based on the criteria established in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” issued by
    COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Applied Materials, Inc. as of
    October 30, 2005 and October 31, 2004, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and our report
    dated December 14, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements.

    thousands):

2000 Global Equity Incentive Plan

The 2000
    Global Equity Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan) was adopted
    effective as of June 21, 2000. The 2000 Plan provides for
    the grant of non-qualified stock options to employees other than
    officers and directors. The administrator of the 2000 Plan
    (either the Board or a committee appointed by the Board)
    determines the terms and conditions of all stock options
    granted; provided, however, that (1) the exercise price
    generally may not be less than 100 percent of the fair
    market value (on the date of grant) of the stock covered by the
    option, and (2) the term of options can be no longer than
    10 years (extended to up to 13 years in the event of
    death). A total of 147,000 shares has been authorized for
    issuance under the 2000 Plan, and 10,543 shares remain
    available for issuance as of October 30, 2005.

1998 Non-Executive Employee Retention Stock Option
    Plan

The 1998 Non-Executive Employee Retention
    Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Plan) was adopted effective as of
    September 2, 1998. The 1998 Plan provides for the grant of
    non-qualified stock options to employees who, as of
    October 9, 1998, were not officers. The administrator of
    the 1998 Plan (a committee appointed by the Board) determines
    the terms and conditions of all stock options granted; provided,
    however, that (1) the exercise price may not be less than
    100 percent of the fair market value (on the date of grant)
    of the stock covered by the option, and (2) options
    generally expire no later than November 13, 2005. Vesting
    fully accelerates in the event of an optionee’s death. A
    total of 10,609 shares has been authorized for issuance
    under the 1998 Plan, and 14 shares remain unissued as of
    October 30, 2005. By the express terms of the 1998 Plan, no
    options may be granted after October 10, 1998 (unless
    applicable law of countries other than the U.S. requires grant
    dates to be postponed).



Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees

The Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees (the Offshore
    Plan) was adopted effective as of October 16, 1995. The
    Offshore Plan provides for the grant of stock options to
    employees (other than U.S. citizens or residents) through one or
    more offerings. The administrator of the Offshore Plan (the
    Board or a committee appointed by the Board) determines the
    terms and conditions of all options prior to the start of an
    offering, including the option exercise price, number of shares
    covered and when an option may be exercised. All options granted
    as part of an offering must be granted on the same date. A total
    of 12,800 shares has been authorized for issuance under the
    Offshore Plan, and 4,843 shares remain available for
    issuance as of October 30, 2005.

APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of Applied Materials, Inc. and
    its subsidiaries (Applied or the Company) after elimination of
    intercompany balances and transactions. All references to a
    fiscal year apply to Applied’s fiscal year which ends on
    the last Sunday in October. Fiscal 2003 and 2005 contained
    52 weeks, whereas fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks. The
    first fiscal quarter of 2003 and 2005 each contained
    13 weeks, whereas the first fiscal quarter of 2004
    contained 14 weeks.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    materially from those estimates.

Reclassifications

Auction rate securities in
    the amount of $589 million and variable rate demand notes
    in the amount of $200 million have been reclassified from
    cash and cash equivalents to short-term investments in the
    October 31, 2004 consolidated balance sheet to conform to
    the fiscal 2005 financial statement presentation. Accordingly,
    the consolidated statements of cash flows for the fiscal years
    ended October 26, 2003, October 31, 2004 and
    October 30, 2005 reflect this presentation. Certain other
    reclassifications have been made within the Notes to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements to conform to the 2005
    presentation.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term
    Investments

All highly-liquid investments with a
    remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of
    purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. All of
    Applied’s short-term investments are classified as

available-for-sale

at the respective balance sheet dates. Investments classified as

available-for-sale

are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and
    any temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an
    investment is presented as a separate component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income. The specific identification method
    is used to determine the gains and losses on investments.

Inventories

Inventories are generally stated
    at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a
    first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant
    and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over
    the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line
    method. Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes
    are as follows: buildings and improvements, 3 to 33 years;
    demonstration and manufacturing equipment, 3 to 5 years;
    software, 3 to 5 years; and furniture, fixtures and other
    equipment, 3 to 15 years. Land improvements are amortized
    over the shorter of 15 years or the estimated useful life.
    Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of five
    years or the lease term. During fiscal 2003, Applied reviewed
    the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets. This analysis
    indicated that estimated useful lives for certain assets should
    be increased based on historical experience and other
    considerations. This change in estimate resulted in
    approximately $23 million less depreciation expense in
    fiscal 2003 than would have been recognized under previous
    estimates.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for
    impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
    year. Purchased technology and other intangible assets are
    presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives of 2 to
    10 years using the straight-line method.

Long-Lived Assets

Applied reviews long-lived
    assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets
    may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these assets for
    impairment based on estimated future cash flows from these
    assets.

Research, Development and Engineering
    Costs

Research, development and engineering costs
    are expensed as incurred.



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are
    expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were not material for
    all periods presented.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense/(benefit) is
    based on pretax earnings. Deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary
    differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
    their reported amounts.

Revenue Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue
    when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
    occurred or services have been rendered; seller’s price to
    buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably
    assured. Applied’s shipping terms are customarily FOB
    Applied shipping point or equivalent terms. Applied’s
    revenue recognition policy generally results in revenue
    recognition at the following points. (1) For all
    transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon
    shipment, Applied recognizes revenue upon shipment for all
    products that have been demonstrated to meet product
    specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue
    associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred
    based on the estimated fair value, and that revenue is
    recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks.
    (2) For products that have not been demonstrated to meet
    product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized
    at customer technical acceptance. (3) For transactions
    where legal title does not pass at shipment, revenue is
    recognized when legal title passes to the customer, which is
    typically at customer technical acceptance. (4) For
    arrangements containing multiple elements, the revenue relating
    to the undelivered elements is deferred at estimated fair value
    until delivery of the deferred elements. In cases where Applied
    has sold products that have been demonstrated to meet product
    specifications prior to shipment, Applied believes that at the
    time of delivery, it has an enforceable claim to amounts
    recognized as revenue. Spare parts revenue is generally
    recognized upon shipment, and services revenue is generally
    recognized over the period that the services are provided.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Applied uses
    financial instruments, such as forward exchange and currency
    option contracts, to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing
    and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions
    expected to occur within 12 months. The terms of currency
    instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent
    with the timing of the transactions being hedged. The purpose of
    Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the
    effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
    denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. All of
    Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at
    fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable
    instruments. For derivative instruments designated and
    qualifying as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency
    denominated transactions, the effective portion of the gain or
    loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders’ equity,
    and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction
    affects earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to
    occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective, the
    gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded
    promptly in earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge
    existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the
    gain or loss on these hedges is recorded promptly in earnings to
    offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or
    liabilities being hedged. Applied does not use derivative
    financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Translation

Applied’s
    subsidiaries, with the exception primarily of the subsidiary
    located in the United Kingdom, use the U.S. dollar as their
    functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of
    these subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect
    at the end of the period, except for non-monetary assets, such
    as inventories and property, plant and equipment, that are
    translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs
    are translated using average exchange rates for the period,
    except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are
    translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting
    translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations as incurred. Applied’s subsidiary
    located in the United Kingdom operates primarily using the
    British pound, and therefore, the British pound has been
    determined to be the functional currency for the United Kingdom
    subsidiary. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of this
    subsidiary are translated using exchange rates in effect at the
    end of the period, and revenues and costs are translated using
    average exchange



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

rates for the period. The resulting translation adjustments are
    presented as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Prior to the second fiscal quarter of 2003, Applied’s
    subsidiaries located in Japan and Europe operated primarily
    using local currencies as their functional currencies. During
    the second fiscal quarter of 2003, Applied reviewed the
    functional currencies of its subsidiaries and determined that
    the U.S. dollar was most appropriate for its subsidiaries, with
    the exception of its subsidiary located in the United Kingdom.
    This determination was made as a result of changes in facts,
    circumstances, scope of operations and business practices. The
    change in the functional currencies did not have a material
    effect on Applied’s business, results of operations or
    financial position for fiscal 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

Applied measures
    compensation expense for its stock-based employee compensation
    plans using the intrinsic value method. As the exercise price of
    all options granted under these plans was not below the fair
    market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date,
    no stock-based employee compensation cost is recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations for stock options.

In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 148 (SFAS 148), “Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and
    Disclosure — an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 123” and SFAS No. 123 (SFAS 123),
    “Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,”
    Applied’s pro forma option expense is computed using the
    Black-Scholes option pricing model. This model was developed for
    use in estimating the value of publicly traded options that have
    no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable.
    Applied’s employee stock options have characteristics
    significantly different from those of publicly traded options.
    Beginning in the first fiscal quarter of 2006, Applied will
    comply with SFAS No. 123R (SFAS 123R), as discussed
    further in Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

The following table illustrates the effect on the net
    income/(loss) and earnings/(loss) per share as if Applied had
    implemented the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS 123, as amended by SFAS 148, to options granted
    under the stock-based employee compensation plans. For purposes
    of this pro forma disclosure, the estimated value of the options
    is amortized ratably to expense over the options’ vesting
    periods. If Applied recognized the expense of equity programs in
    the consolidated statement of operations, additional paid-in
    capital would have increased by a corresponding amount, net of
    applicable taxes.

Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted
    average estimated fair value of employee stock option grants was
    $6.85 for fiscal 2003, $10.06 for fiscal 2004 and $6.46 for
    fiscal 2005. The weighted average estimated fair value of
    purchase rights granted under Applied’s employees’
    stock purchase plans (ESPP) was $5.31 for fiscal 2003, $5.91 for
    fiscal 2004, and $5.65 for fiscal 2005. Beginning in the first
    fiscal quarter of 2005, the computation of the expected
    volatility assumption used in the Black-Scholes calculations for
    new grants changed from being based solely on historical
    volatility to being based on a combination of historical and
    implied volatilities. In calculating pro forma compensation, the
    fair value of each stock option grant and stock purchase right
    is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions:

On August 4, 2005, the Human Resources and Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied approved the
    vesting acceleration of certain unvested,

out-of-the-money

stock options outstanding under Applied’s employee stock
    option plans, effective August 5, 2005. Stock options held
    by Applied’s five most senior executive officers,
    non-employee directors and consultants were not included in the
    vesting acceleration. Vesting was accelerated for stock options
    that had exercise prices greater than $17.85 per share, which
    was the closing price of Applied common stock on August 5,
    2005. In connection with the modification of the terms of these
    options to accelerate their vesting, approximately
    $138 million was recorded as a non-cash compensation
    expense on a pro forma basis in accordance with SFAS 123,
    and this amount is included in the proforma table above for the
    year ended October 30, 2005. This action was taken to
    reduce the impact of future compensation expense that Applied
    would otherwise be required to recognize in future consolidated
    statements of operations pursuant to SFAS 123R, which is
    applicable to Applied beginning in the first fiscal quarter of
    2006.

For additional information on Applied’s employee benefit
    plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial
    instruments that potentially subject Applied to significant
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
    equivalents, short-term investments, trade accounts receivable
    and derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.
    Applied invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as,
    but not limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate and
    municipal bonds, and U.S. Treasury and agency securities,
    mortgage-backed securities, and, by policy, limits the amount of
    credit exposure with any one financial institution or commercial
    issuer. Applied’s customers consist of integrated circuit
    manufacturers located throughout the world. Applied performs
    ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial
    condition and generally requires no collateral to secure
    accounts receivable. Applied maintains an allowance reserve for
    potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on its
    assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable. Applied
    regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as
    historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts
    receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may
    affect a customer’s ability to pay. In addition, Applied
    utilizes letters of credit to mitigate credit risk when
    considered appropriate. Applied is exposed to credit-related
    losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to
    derivative financial instruments, but does not expect any
    counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is
    determined using the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is

    and equivalents (representing the dilutive effect of stock
    options and restricted stock units) outstanding during the

For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted
    average common share equivalents do not include stock options
    with an exercise price that exceeded the average fair market
    value of Applied’s common stock for the period, as the
    effect would be anti-dilutive. Options to purchase shares of
    common stock that were excluded from the computation were as
    follows:

Fiscal 2003 amounts are presented for informational purposes

Restricted Stock

During fiscal 2003, Applied
    issued 307,500 shares of restricted stock to two
    individuals, which consisted principally of an initial
    compensation package for Applied’s new President and Chief
    Executive Officer (CEO). On May 20, 2003, Applied issued
    300,000 shares of restricted common stock at $0.01 per
    share to the new President and CEO. The closing market price of
    Applied’s common stock was $13.76 per share on May 20,
    2003. One half of the shares vested on October 1, 2003, and
    the other half of the shares vested on October 1, 2004.
    Deferred compensation was charged for the difference between the
    market value of the restricted shares and the purchase price,
    and was presented as a reduction of stockholders’ equity in
    Applied’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred compensation
    was amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period.
    Applied recognized general and administrative expenses of
    approximately $2.7 million in fiscal 2003,
    $1.4 million in fiscal 2004 and $96,000 in fiscal 2005 in
    amortization expense related to restricted stock issuances.

Restricted Stock Units

During the fourth
    fiscal quarter of 2005, Applied issued 75,000 shares of
    restricted stock units (referred to as “performance
    shares” under the Applied Materials, Inc. Equity Incentive
    Plan). The closing market price of Applied’s common stock
    on that day was $17.47 per share. One third of the restricted
    stock units will vest on each of July 15, 2007,
    July 15, 2008 and July 15, 2009, subject to continued
    service to Applied on each vesting date. Compensation expense is
    recognized over the vesting period, and resulted in $55,000 in
    general and administrative expense in fiscal 2005.

Dividends

Beginning in the second fiscal
    quarter of 2005, Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    three consecutive quarterly cash dividends in the amount of
    $0.03 per share per declaration. The first two declared cash
    dividends were paid during fiscal 2005, totaling
    $98 million. The third quarterly cash dividend was paid on
    December 8, 2005, to stockholders of record on
    November 17, 2005 in the amount of $48 million. The
    declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of
    the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s
    financial condition, results of operations, capital
    requirements, business conditions and other factors.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued SFAS No. 154, “Accounting Changes and
    Error Corrections — a Replacement of APB Opinion
    No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3” (SFAS 154),
    which requires retrospective application to prior periods’
    financial statements of every voluntary change in accounting
    principal unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS 154 is
    effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors
    beginning in fiscal 2007. Applied does not expect the adoption
    of this standard to have a material effect on Applied’s
    financial position or results of operations.

In March 2005, the SEC released SEC Staff Accounting
    Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107). SAB 107 provides
    the SEC staff position regarding the application of
    SFAS 123R, “Share-Based Payment.” SAB 107
    contains interpretive guidance relating to the interaction
    between SFAS 123R and certain SEC rules and regulations, as
    well as the staff’s views regarding the valuation of
    share-based payment arrangements for public companies.
    SAB 107 also highlights the importance of disclosures made
    related to the accounting for share-based payment transactions.
    Applied is

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

currently evaluating SAB 107 and will be incorporating it
    as part of its adoption of SFAS 123R in the first fiscal
    quarter of 2006.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R,
    “Share-Based Payment,” which requires companies to
    measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based
    payments at fair value. In April 2005, the SEC extended the
    compliance requirement date of SFAS 123R, with the result
    that this requirement will be effective for Applied beginning
    with the first fiscal quarter of 2006. Applied is currently
    evaluating the expected impact of SFAS 123R to its
    Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1 of Notes to
    the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to
    the pro forma effect on Applied’s reported net income and
    net earnings per share of applying the fair value provisions of
    the SFAS 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation,” to stock-based employee compensation.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,
    “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43,
    Chapter 4,” (SFAS 151). SFAS 151 clarifies
    that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities,
    excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials
    (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period
    charges. SFAS 151 will be effective in fiscal years
    beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of
    SFAS 151 is not expected to have a material effect on
    Applied’s financial position or results of operations.

In March 2004, the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)
    reached a consensus on EITF Issue

No. 03-1,

“The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments”
    (EITF 03-1). The guidance prescribes a three-step model for
    determining whether an investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired and requires disclosures about unrealized losses on
    investments. The accounting guidance became effective for
    reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, while the
    disclosure requirements became effective for annual reporting
    periods ending after June 15, 2004. In September 2004, the
    FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) EITF 03-1-1,
    “Effective Date of

Paragraphs 10-20

of EITF Issue

No. 03-1

‘The
    Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (FSP
    EITF 03-1-1). FSP EITF 03-1-1 delayed the effective date for the
    measurement and recognition guidance contained in

paragraphs 10-20

of EITF Issue 03-1. In November 2005, the FASB issued FSP

FAS 115-1

and

FAS 124-1,

“The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and its Application to Certain

other-than-temporary

Investments.” This FSP addresses the determination as to
    when an investment is considered impaired, whether the
    impairment is

other-than-temporary

and the measurement of an impairment loss. This statement
    specifically nullifies the requirements of

paragraph 10-18

of
    EITF 03-1 and references existing

other-than-temporary

impairment guidance. The guidance under this FSP is effective
    for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005.
    Applied continued to apply relevant

“other-than-temporary”

guidance as provided for in FSP EITF 03-1-1 during fiscal 2005.
    Applied does not expect the implementation of FSP

FAS 115-1

and

FAS 124-1

will
    have a material effect on Applied’s financial position or
    results of operations.

    losses were $7 million. For

The gross unrealized losses related to short-term investments
    are primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of debt
    securities as a result of an increase in interest rates during
    fiscal 2005. Applied has determined that the gross unrealized
    losses on its short-term investments at October 30, 2005
    are temporary in nature. Applied reviews its investment
    portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that have
    indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in
    determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of
    time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost
    basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the
    investee, credit quality and Applied’s ability to hold the
    investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
    anticipated recovery in market value.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative
    instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency
    exchange contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet at fair
    value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not
    qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion
    of any hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All of
    Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at
    their fair value in other current assets or accounts payable and
    accrued expenses.

Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with
    certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as
    Japanese yen, British pound, euro and Israeli shekel. The
    purpose of Applied’s foreign currency management is to
    mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain
    foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash
    flows. The terms of currency instruments used for hedging
    purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the
    transactions being hedged.

Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward
    exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge
    certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions
    expected to occur within the next 12 months. Hedges related
    to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the
    inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges, and are evaluated
    for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of the gain
    or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’
    equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged
    transaction affects earnings. Amounts included in accumulated
    other comprehensive income at October 30, 2005 will
    generally be reclassified into earnings within 12 months.
    Changes in the fair value of currency forward exchange and
    option contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from
    the assessment of effectiveness, and are recognized in cost of
    products sold. The change in option and forward time value was
    not material for fiscal 2003, 2004 or 2005. If the transaction
    being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative
    is ineffective, Applied promptly recognizes the gain or loss on
    the associated financial instrument in



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

general and administrative expenses. The amounts recognized due
    to anticipated transactions failing to occur were not material
    for all periods presented.

Forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain
    foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. These
    derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
    Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are
    recorded promptly in earnings to offset the changes in the fair
    value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

    income was as follows:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The
    carrying amounts of Applied’s financial instruments,
    including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes
    payable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate
    fair value due to the short maturities of these financial
    instruments. At October 31, 2004, the carrying amount of
    long-term debt was $456 million, and the estimated fair
    value was $510 million. At October 30, 2005, the
    carrying amount of long-term debt was $415 million, and the
    estimated fair value was $432 million. The estimated fair
    value of long-term debt is based primarily on quoted market
    prices for the same or similar issues.

Goodwill is not amortized but reviewed for impairment annually
    during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Applied conducted
    goodwill impairment tests in fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005, and
    the results of these tests indicated that Applied’s
    goodwill assets were not impaired. From October 31, 2004 to
    October 30, 2005, the change in goodwill was
    $82 million, due primarily to the acquisition of all of the
    operating subsidiaries and businesses of Metron Technology N.V.
    (Metron Technology) and the assets of ATMI, Inc.’s
    Treatment Systems business (EcoSys). Other assets that are not
    subject to amortization consist primarily of a trade name
    associated with the Metron Technology acquisition. For

Borrowing
    Facilities

At October 30, 2005, Applied had credit facilities for
    unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to
    approximately $415 million, of which $250 million was
    comprised of a revolving credit agreement in the United States
    with a group of banks that expires in September 2006. The
    agreement provides for borrowings at various rates, including
    the lead bank’s prime reference rate, and includes
    financial and other covenants with which Applied was in
    compliance at October 30, 2005. No amount was outstanding
    under this agreement at October 30, 2005. The remaining
    credit facilities of approximately $165 million are with
    Japanese banks at rates indexed to their prime reference rate
    and are denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts were outstanding
    under these Japanese credit facilities at October 30, 2005.

Applied has debt agreements that contain financial and other
    covenants. These covenants require Applied to maintain certain
    minimum financial ratios. At October 30, 2005, Applied was
    in compliance with all covenants.

Aggregate debt maturities at October 30, 2005 were:
    $8 million in fiscal 2006, $202 million in fiscal
    2007, $3 million in fiscal 2008, $1 million in fiscal
    2009, $1 million in fiscal 2010, and $200 million
    thereafter.

Restructuring,
    Asset Impairments and Other Charges

Restructuring, asset impairments and other charges for fiscal
    2003 totaled $372 million, consisting of $186 million
    for headcount reductions, $86 million for consolidation of
    facilities and $100 million for other costs, primarily
    fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidations.

Restructuring, asset impairments and other charges for fiscal
    2004 totaled $167 million, consisting of $65 million
    for facility consolidations, $6 million for severance and
    benefits, and $96 million for other costs, primarily
    related to fixed asset writeoffs due to facility consolidations.



APPLIED

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

The restructuring actions in fiscal 2003 and 2004 were taken to
    align Applied’s cost structure with prevailing market
    conditions due to the industry downturn at the time. These
    actions, which were necessary as a result of reduced business
    volume, decreased Applied’s global workforce and
    consolidated Applied’s global facilities.

There were no restructuring, asset impairments or other charges
    for fiscal 2005.

As of October 30, 2005, the majority of the fiscal 2003 and
    2004 restructuring actions have been completed, and
    restructuring reserve balances consisted principally of
    remaining lease commitments associated with facilities.

Changes in restructuring reserves for fiscal 2003, 2004 and 2005

Stock Repurchase Program

Since March 1996,
    Applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common
    stock in the open market to partially fund its stock-based
    employee benefit and incentive plans. Upon the expiration of the
    previous authorization on March 24, 2004, the Board of
    Directors extended the share repurchase program and authorized
    the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Applied’s
    common stock in the open market over the succeeding three years.
    On March 22, 2005, the Board of Directors approved a new
    stock repurchase program for up to $4.0 billion over the
    next three years ending March 2008. In fiscal 2003, there were
    15,588,000 shares repurchased at an average price of $16.03
    per share. In fiscal 2004, there were 37,784,000 shares
    repurchased at an average price of $17.20 per share. In fiscal
    2005, there were 101,208,000 shares repurchased at an
    average price of $16.80 per share.

Dividends

During fiscal 2005, Applied’s
    Board of Directors declared cash dividends for three consecutive
    quarters beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2005, in the
    amount of $0.03 per share per declaration. The first two
    declared cash dividends were paid during fiscal 2005, totaling
    $98 million. The third declared cash dividend was paid on
    December 8, 2005 to stockholders of record on
    November 17, 2005 in the amount of $48 million. The
    declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of
    the Board of Directors and will depend on the Company’s
    financial condition, results of operations, capital
    requirements, business conditions and other factors.

Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan

Applied
    sponsors two Employees’ Stock Purchase Plans for the
    benefit of United States (U.S.) and international employees,
    respectively. The U.S. plan is qualified under Section 423
    of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the ESPP substantially all
    employees may purchase Applied’s common stock through
    payroll deductions at a price equal to 85 percent of the lower
    of the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period
    or at the end of each applicable purchase period. Beginning in
    December 2002, Applied amended the ESPP to extend the offering
    period from 6 months to 24 months, composed of four
    six-month purchase periods. ESPP contributions are limited to a
    maximum of 10 percent of an employee’s eligible
    compensation, up to a



APPLIED

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

maximum of $6,500, per six-month purchase period. ESPP
    participants are also limited to purchasing a maximum of
    1,000 shares per purchase period. Shares issued under the
    ESPP were 6,212,000 for fiscal 2003, 5,308,000 for fiscal 2004
    and 4,879,000 for fiscal 2005. At October 30, 2005, there
    were 14,735,000 shares reserved for future issuance under
    the ESPP.

Stock-Based Compensation

See Note 1 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Restricted Stock

During fiscal 2003, Applied
    issued 307,500 shares of restricted stock to two
    individuals, which consisted principally of an initial
    compensation package for Applied’s new President and Chief
    Executive Officer (CEO). On May 20, 2003, Applied issued
    300,000 shares of restricted common stock at $0.01 per
    share to the new President and CEO. The closing market price of
    Applied’s common stock was $13.76 per share on May 20,
    2003. One half of the shares vested on October 1, 2003, and
    the other half of the shares vested on October 1, 2004.
    Deferred compensation was charged for the difference between the
    market value of the restricted shares and the purchase price,
    and was presented as a reduction of stockholders’ equity in
    Applied’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred compensation
    was amortized as compensation expense over the vesting period.
    Applied recognized general and administrative expenses of
    approximately $2.7 million in fiscal 2003,
    $1.4 million in fiscal 2004 and $96,000 in fiscal 2005 in
    amortization expense related to restricted stock issuances.

Restricted Stock Units

During the fourth
    fiscal quarter of 2005, Applied issued 75,000 shares of
    restricted stock units (referred to as “performance
    shares” under the Applied Materials, Inc. Equity Incentive
    Plan). The closing market price of Applied’s common stock
    on that day was $17.47 per share. One third of the restricted
    stock units will vest on each of July 15, 2007,
    July 15, 2008 and July 15, 2009, subject to continued
    service to Applied on each vesting date. Compensation expense is
    recognized over the vesting period, and resulted in $55,000 in
    general and administrative expense in fiscal 2005.

Employee Bonus Plans

Applied has various
    employee bonus plans. A profit-sharing plan provides for the
    distribution of a percentage of pre-tax profits to substantially
    all Applied employees not eligible for other performance-based
    incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of compensation.
    Other plans award annual bonuses to Applied’s executives
    and key contributors based on the achievement of profitability
    and other specific performance criteria. Applied also has
    agreements with key technical employees that provide for
    additional compensation related to the success of new product
    development and achievement of specified profitability criteria.
    Charges to expense under these plans were not material for
    fiscal 2003, were $309 million for fiscal 2004 and were
    $138 million for fiscal 2005.

Employee Savings and Retirement Plan

The
    Employee Savings and Retirement Plan is qualified under
    Sections 401(a) and (k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Applied contributes a percentage of each participating
    employee’s salary deferral contributions. These matching
    contributions generally become 20 percent vested at the end of
    an employee’s second year of service with Applied, and vest
    20 percent per year of service thereafter until they become
    fully vested at the end of six years of service. Effective
    January 1, 2004, each participant may elect to have the
    Company matching contributions invested in any of the
    diversified investment funds available under the plan or in
    Applied’s common stock. Prior to 2004, the Company matching
    contributions were invested in Applied’s common stock.
    Applied’s matching contributions under this plan were
    approximately $13 million, net of $12 million in
    forfeitures, for fiscal 2003, $17 million, net of
    $8 million in forfeitures, for fiscal 2004, and
    $25 million, net of $1 million in forfeitures, for
    fiscal 2005.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign
    Subsidiaries

Several of Applied’s foreign
    subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering
    substantially all of their eligible employees. Benefits under
    these plans are typically based on years of service and final
    average compensation levels. Applied uses August 31 as a
    measurement date. The plans are managed in accordance with
    applicable local statutes and practices. Applied deposits funds
    for certain of these plans with insurance companies, pension
    trustees, government-managed accounts, and/or accrues the
    expense for the unfunded portion of the benefit obligation on
    its consolidated financial statements. Where appropriate, the
    pension plans retain professional investment managers that
    invest plan



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

assets in equity securities, fixed income securities, cash and
    other institutional investments. Applied’s practice is to
    fund the various pension plans in amounts sufficient to meet the
    minimum requirements as established by applicable local
    governmental oversight and taxing authorities. Depending on the
    design of the plan, local custom and market circumstances, the
    liabilities of a plan may exceed qualified plan assets. The
    differences between the aggregate accumulated benefit
    obligations and aggregate plan assets of these plans have been
    recorded as liabilities by Applied and are included in accrued
    expenses and other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

Applied’s investment strategy for its defined benefit plans
    is to invest assets in a prudent manner, maintaining
    well-diversified portfolios with the long-term objective of
    meeting the obligations of the plans as they come due. Asset
    allocation decisions are typically made by plan fiduciaries with
    input from Applied’s pension committee. Applied’s
    asset allocation strategy incorporates a sufficient equity
    exposure in order for the plans to benefit from the expected
    long-term outperformance of equities relative to the plans’
    liabilities. Applied retains investment managers, where
    appropriate, to manage the assets of the plans. Performance of
    investment managers is monitored by plan fiduciaries with the
    assistance of local investment consultants. The investment
    managers make investment decisions within the guidelines set
    forth by plan fiduciaries. Risk management practices include
    diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and
    periodic rebalancing toward target asset allocation ranges.
    Investment managers may use derivative instruments for efficient
    portfolio management purposes. Plan assets do not include any of
    Applied’s own equity or debt securities.

Asset return assumptions are derived based on actuarial and
    statistical methodologies, from analysis of long-term historical
    data relevant to the country in which each plan is in effect and
    the investments applicable to the corresponding plan. The
    discount rate for each plan was derived by reference to
    appropriate benchmark yields on high quality corporate bonds,
    allowing for the approximate duration of both plan obligations
    and the relevant benchmark index.

Future expected benefit payments over the next ten fiscal years
    are: $5 million in fiscal 2006, $6 million in fiscal
    2007, $6 million in fiscal 2008, $6 million in fiscal
    2009, $6 million in fiscal 2010, and $39 million
    collectively for fiscal years 2011 through 2015. Company
    contributions to these plans for fiscal 2006 are expected to be
    approximately $21 million.

Executive Deferred Compensation Plans

Applied
    sponsors two unfunded deferred compensation plans, the Executive
    Deferred Compensation Plan (Predecessor EDCP) and the 2005
    Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (2005 EDCP), under which
    certain employees may elect to defer a portion of their
    following year’s eligible earnings. The Predecessor EDCP
    was frozen as of December 31, 2004 such that no new
    deferrals could be made under the plan after that date and the
    plan would qualify for “grandfather” relief under
    Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Predecessor
    EDCP participant accounts continue to be maintained under the
    plan and credited with deemed interest. The 2005 EDCP was
    adopted by Applied effective as of January 1, 2005 and is
    intended to comply with the requirements of Code
    Section 409A. Amounts payable, including accrued deemed
    interest, totaled $81 million at October 31, 2004 and
    $83 million at October 30, 2005, which were included
    in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance
    Sheets.

Post-Retirement Benefits

On January 1,
    1999, Applied adopted a plan that provides certain medical and
    vision benefits to eligible retirees who are at least
    age 55 and who have at least 10 years of service at
    their date of retirement. An eligible retiree may elect coverage
    for an eligible spouse or domestic partner who is not eligible
    for Medicare. Coverage under the plan generally ends for both
    the retiree and spouse or domestic partner upon becoming
    eligible for Medicare. This plan has not had, and is not
    expected to have, a material effect on Applied’s
    consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 created a temporary
    incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income
    earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received
    deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign
    corporations. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2005,
    Applied’s foreign subsidiaries distributed
    $270 million to Applied Materials, Inc. The distribution
    increased the provision for income taxes by $32 million and
    income taxes payable by $14 million. The charge resulted in
    a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital as it
    related primarily to stock option compensation of employees
    working in foreign subsidiaries from which earnings were
    repatriated. Except for the items described previously, U.S.
    income taxes have not been provided for approximately
    $165 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of
    several non-U.S. subsidiaries. Applied intends to reinvest these
    earnings indefinitely in operations outside of the U.S.

As of October 30, 2005, Applied’s federal tax credit
    carryforwards for tax return purposes were $146 million.
    Management believes that tax credit carryforwards will be
    utilized in future periods. Federal tax credit carryforwards
    will begin to expire in 2011.

Applied’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax
    benefits associated with employee stock option transactions.
    These benefits, credited directly to stockholders’ equity,
    amounted to $101 million for fiscal 2004 and



APPLIED

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

$85 million for fiscal 2005, with a corresponding reduction
    to taxes payable of $101 million in fiscal 2004 and a
    reduction to taxes payable of $85 million in fiscal 2005.

Applied’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years 2002
    through 2004 are under Internal Revenue Service examination.
    Management believes that adequate amounts have been accrued for
    any adjustments that may ultimately result from these
    examinations.

Note 10

Industry
    Segment and Foreign Operations

Applied operates in one reportable segment for the manufacture,
    marketing and servicing of integrated circuit fabrication
    equipment. In accordance with SFAS No. 131
    (SFAS 131), “Disclosures About Segments of an
    Enterprise and Related Information,” Applied’s chief
    operating decision-maker has been identified as the President
    and CEO, who reviews operating results to make decisions about
    allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire
    company. All material operating segments qualify for aggregation
    under SFAS 131 due to similarities in the following:
    customer base; economic characteristics; nature of products and
    services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution
    processes. Since Applied operates in one reportable segment and
    in one group of similar products and services, all financial
    segment and product line information required by SFAS 131
    can be found in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

For geographical reporting, revenues are attributed to the
    geographic location in which the customers’ facilities are
    located. Long-lived assets consist primarily of property, plant
    and equipment, and are attributed to the geographic location in
    which they are located. Net sales and long-lived assets by
    geographic region were as follows:

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

Applied leases some of its facilities and equipment under
    non-cancelable operating leases and has options to renew most
    leases, with rentals to be negotiated. Total rent expense was
    $134 million for fiscal 2003, $88 million for fiscal
    2004, and $87 million for fiscal 2005. Future minimum lease
    payments at October 30, 2005 were: $74 million for
    fiscal 2006; $54 million for fiscal 2007; $33 million
    for fiscal 2008; $26 million for fiscal 2009;
    $19 million for fiscal 2010; and $66 million
    collectively for all periods thereafter.

Accounts
    Receivables Sales

Applied has agreements with various financial institutions to
    sell accounts receivable from selected customers. Applied also
    discounts letters of credit through various financial
    institutions. Under these agreements, Applied sold accounts
    receivable and discounted letters of credit in the amounts of
    $556 million for fiscal 2003, $859 million for fiscal
    2004 and $158 million for fiscal 2005. Discounting fees
    were not material for fiscal 2003, 2004 or 2005. At
    October 30, 2005, $2 million of sold accounts
    receivable remained outstanding under these agreements. A
    portion of these sold accounts receivable is subject to certain
    recourse provisions. Applied has not experienced any losses
    under these recourse provisions.

Guarantees

Applied products are generally sold with a

12-month

warranty
    period following installation. The provision for the estimated
    cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is recognized. Parts
    and labor are covered under the terms of the warranty agreement.
    The warranty provision is based on historical experience by
    product, configuration and geographic region.

    Accordingly, current warranty provisions are related to the
    current year’s net sales, and warranty consumption is
    associated with current and prior year’s net sales.

During the ordinary course of business, Applied also provides
    standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to
    certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated
    by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 30,
    2005, the maximum potential amount of future payments that
    Applied could be required to make under these guarantee
    agreements was approximately $60 million. Applied has not
    recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee
    arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for
    the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not
    believe, based on historical experience and information
    currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will
    be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has agreements with various global banks to
    facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including
    overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters
    of credit. As of October 30, 2005, Applied Materials Inc.
    has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately
    $65 million to cover these services.

Legal
    Matters

On March 12, 2002, Linear Technology Corp. (LTC) filed a
    lawsuit against Applied in the Superior Court of the County of
    Santa Clara, California, alleging claims for breach of contract,
    fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation, suppression of
    fact, unfair competition, breach of warranty, express
    contractual indemnity, implied equitable indemnity and
    declaratory relief related to LTC’s assertion that Applied
    is obligated to indemnify and defend LTC for certain claims in
    an underlying patent infringement lawsuit brought by Texas
    Instruments, Inc. After the court dismissed many of its claims,
    LTC amended its complaint. LTC’s Amended Complaint, as well
    as its Second, Third and Fourth Amended Complaints, were
    dismissed by the Court in whole or in part. On July 7,
    2004, LTC filed a Fifth Amended Complaint, which the Court
    dismissed with prejudice on October 5, 2004. On
    January 11, 2005, LTC filed a notice of appeal of the
    dismissal of its complaint. Applied believes it has meritorious
    defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

On July 31, 2001, David Scharf, an individual, filed a
    lawsuit against Applied alleging that Applied has infringed, has
    induced others to infringe and has contributed to others’
    infringement of a patent concerning color synthesizing scanning
    electron microscope technology. Mr. Scharf seeks a
    preliminary and permanent injunction, a finding of willful
    infringement, damages (including treble damages), and costs.
    Applied has answered the complaint and counterclaimed for
    declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. On
    May 10, 2002, Mr. Scharf filed a request for
    re-examination of his patent with the Patent and Trademark
    Office (PTO). On June 26, 2002, the case was removed from
    the Court’s active docket after the parties stipulated to
    stay the case pending the results of that re-examination. On
    July 11, 2002, Applied filed its own request for
    re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with the Patent
    and Trademark Office. Applied’s request for re-examination
    was granted on September 19, 2002. On April 23, 2004,
    the PTO notified Applied that it intended to issue a
    re-examination certificate. On June 14, 2004, Applied filed
    a second request for re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s
    patent with the PTO. The second request was denied on
    September 1, 2004. On October 1, 2004, Applied filed a
    petition for reconsideration of that denial,



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

which subsequently was denied. Applied believes it has
    meritorious defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue
    them vigorously.

On December 24, 2003, Applied filed a lawsuit against
    Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. (Jusung Engineering) and Jusung
    Pacific Co., Ltd., (Jusung Pacific, and referred to together
    with Jusung Engineering as Jusung) in Tao-Yuan District Court in
    Taiwan, captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung Engineering
    Co., Ltd. (case no. 92 Tsai-chuan Tzi No. 6388). The
    lawsuit alleges that Jusung is infringing a patent related to
    chemical vapor deposition owned by Applied. In the suit, Applied
    seeks a provisional injunction prohibiting Jusung from
    importing, using, manufacturing, servicing or selling in Taiwan
    certain flat panel display manufacturing equipment. On
    December 25, 2003, the Tao-Yuan District Court ruled in
    favor of Applied’s request for a provisional injunction
    and, on January 14, 2004, the Court issued a provisional
    injunction order against Jusung Pacific. Jusung Pacific appealed
    those decisions, and the decisions were affirmed on appeal. On
    January 30, 2004, Jusung Pacific requested permission to
    post a counterbond to have the Jusung Pacific injunction lifted.
    Jusung Pacific’s counterbond request was granted and, on
    March 30, 2004, the provisional injunction order was
    lifted. At Applied’s request, on December 11, 2004,
    the District Court issued a provisional injunction order against
    Jusung Engineering. Jusung Engineering appealed that order, and
    the order was affirmed on appeal. Jusung Engineering also
    requested permission to post a counterbond to have the Jusung
    Engineering injunction lifted. Jusung Engineering’s
    counterbond request was granted, and, on April 25, 2005,
    the provisional injunction order against Jusung Engineering was
    lifted. Applied has appealed both counterbond decisions. On
    June 30, 2004, Applied filed a “main action”
    patent infringement complaint against Jusung in the Hsinchu
    District Court in Taiwan, captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v.
    Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. (case no. 93 Zhong Zhi
    No. 3). In the lawsuit, Applied seeks damages and a
    permanent injunction for infringement of the same patent. The
    decisions regarding the provisional injunction and counterbond
    have no effect on the separate patent infringement lawsuit filed
    by Applied against Jusung in the Hsinchu Court. Applied believes
    it has meritorious claims and intends to pursue them vigorously.

On April 10, 2004, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC)
    notified Applied’s subsidiary AKT that, pursuant to a
    complaint filed by Jusung, the TFTC had begun an investigation
    into whether AKT had violated the Taiwan Fair Trade Act. The
    investigation focuses on whether AKT violated the Taiwan
    Guidelines for the Review of Cases Involving Enterprises Issuing
    Warning Letters for Infringement on Copyright, Trademark and
    Patent Rights by allegedly notifying customers about AKT’s
    patent rights and the infringement of those rights by Jusung. On
    June 15, 2004, the TFTC notified Applied that Applied also
    was the subject of the investigation. By letter dated
    April 15, 2005, the TFTC notified Applied and AKT that
    there was insufficient evidence to support a claim against
    either company. Jusung has appealed the TFTC’s decision,
    and the appeal is pending. Although Applied agrees with the
    TFTC’s decision that there has been no violation, neither
    the extent nor the outcome of the appeal can be determined at
    this time.

Applied does not believe that the outcome of any of the above
    matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition or results of operations. From time to time, Applied
    receives notification from third parties, including customers
    and suppliers, seeking indemnification, litigation support,
    payment of money or other actions by Applied in connection with
    claims made against them. In addition, from time to time,
    Applied receives notification from third parties claiming that
    Applied may be or is infringing their intellectual property or
    other rights. Applied also is subject to various other legal
    proceedings and claims, both asserted and unasserted, that arise
    in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of
    these claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
    Applied does not believe that any of these other existing
    proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on its
    consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Business
    Combinations

On June 28, 2005, Applied purchased certain assets of SCP
    Global Technology, Inc., consisting of single-wafer HF-last
    immersion technology and Marangoni clean/dry intellectual
    property, for approximately $24 million in cash. In
    connection with this asset purchase, Applied recorded purchased
    technology and other intangible assets of $20 million and
    other items of $4 million.

On December 16, 2004, Applied acquired the assets of ATMI,
    Inc.’s Treatment Systems business (EcoSys), which supported
    the gas abatement requirements of process equipment for
    integrated circuit manufacturing and other industrial
    applications, for approximately $16 million in cash. In
    connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $5 million, purchased technology and other intangible
    assets of $8 million and other items of $3 million,
    including liabilities assumed upon acquisition.

On December 14, 2004, Applied acquired substantially all of
    the operating subsidiaries and businesses of Metron Technology
    N.V., a provider of a wide range of outsource solutions to the
    integrated circuit industry, for approximately $85 million
    in cash. In connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded
    goodwill of $76 million and other intangible assets of
    $31 million, partially offset by other items of
    $22 million, primarily for net liabilities assumed upon
    acquisition.

On June 14, 2004, Applied acquired Torrex Equipment
    Corporation, a developer of a multi-wafer system that utilizes
    chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition processes
    to address front-end integrated circuit manufacturing
    applications, for $7 million in cash. In connection with
    this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of $11 million,
    net of adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation,
    partially offset by other items of $4 million, primarily
    for net liabilities assumed upon acquisition. The in-process
    research and development expense related to this transaction was
    not material.

On April 18, 2003, Applied acquired Boxer Cross, Inc., a
    producer of in-line monitoring systems that provide customers
    with critical electrical measurement data for controlling
    integrated circuit processes, for $14 million in cash. In
    connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $18 million, net of adjustments to the initial purchase
    price allocation, and purchased technology of $3 million,
    partially offset by other items of $7 million, primarily
    for deferred tax assets and other liabilities. The in-process
    research and development expense was not material.

For all of the purchase business combinations discussed above,
    the results of operations prior to the acquisition dates were
    not material in relation to those of Applied for any of the
    periods presented herein. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    reviewed periodically for impairment and purchased technology is
    amortized over its useful life of 2 to 10 years. These
    acquisitions have not had, and are not expected to have, a
    material effect on Applied’s financial condition or results
    of operations.

Consolidation
    of Variable Interest Entities

In fiscal 2001, Applied formed Applied Materials Ventures I,
    L.P. (the Fund), to invest in privately-held, early-stage
    companies engaged in developing systems, components and devices
    relating to nanotechnology and/or communications technology for
    specific applications and products. The Fund was formed as a
    limited partnership, with Applied as the sole limited partner
    and an independent party as the general partner. During the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Applied exercised its right to
    limit capital contributions to the Fund to $25 million and
    to terminate the partnership. As a result, under the provisions
    of the partnership agreement, the activities of the partnership
    concluded and the partnership was dissolved in March 2005.
    Applied’s cumulative capital contributions to the Fund

through dissolution totaled approximately $24 million. The
    Fund’s assets, which primarily consisted of shares of
    portfolio companies, were distributed between Applied and the
    general partner during fiscal 2005. Applied recorded its
    investment in the portfolio companies as other long-term assets
    on its consolidated balance sheet at October 30, 2005.

FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
    “Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
    Interpretation of ARB No. 51,” as amended, provides
    guidance on the identification, classification and accounting of
    variable interest entities. The Fund qualified for consolidation
    under FIN 46 and was consolidated in Applied’s
    consolidated financial statements starting in the first quarter
    of fiscal 2004 until it was dissolved. The consolidation and
    dissolution of the Fund did not have a material impact on
    Applied’s consolidated financial condition or results of
    operations for the periods presented.

Note 15

Subsequent
    Event

On November 29, 2005, Applied’s wholly-owned
    subsidiary, Metron Technology, Inc., announced that it has
    agreed to purchase all of the outstanding shares of ChemTrace
    Corporation and ChemTrace Precision Cleaning, Inc. (collectively
    ChemTrace), both privately-held companies, for an undisclosed
    amount, subject to certain closing conditions. ChemTrace
    provides customers with precision parts cleaning and materials
    testing solutions. The results of operations of ChemTrace are
    not expected to have a material effect on Applied’s fiscal
    2006 financial condition or results of operations.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The
    Stockholders and Board of Directors Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    October 30, 2005 and October 31, 2004, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and cash flows for the years then ended. In connection with our
    audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have
    audited the financial statement schedule as of and for each of
    the years in the two year period ended October 30, 2005,
    listed at Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    October 30, 2005 and October 31, 2004, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for the years then
    ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
    accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related
    financial statement schedule as of and for each of the years in
    the two year period ended October 30, 2005, when considered
    in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken
    as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the
    information set forth therein.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of Applied Materials, Inc.’s internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 30, 2005, based on
    criteria established in “Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework” issued by
    the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO), and our report dated December 14, 2005
    expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment
    of, and the effective operation of, internal control over
    financial reporting.

    Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
    plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
    whether the financial statements are free of material
    misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis,
    evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
