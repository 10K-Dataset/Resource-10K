TABLE OF
    CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1:

Business

Incorporated in 1967, Applied, a Delaware corporation, provides
    Nanomanufacturing Technologytm solutions for the global
    semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related industries,
    with a broad portfolio of innovative equipment, service and
    software products. “Nanomanufacturing” is the
    production of ultra-small structures, including the engineering
    of thin films on substrates. Applied’s customers include
    manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, flat panel
    liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar photovoltaic cells and
    modules (solar PVs), and other electronic devices, who use what
    they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to
    other companies for use in advanced electronic components. The
    Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October.

Applied is the world’s largest semiconductor fabrication
    equipment supplier based on revenue, with the capability to
    provide global deployment and support services. Applied also is
    a global leader in LCD fabrication equipment, and is a leading
    supplier of solar PV manufacturing solutions to the emerging
    solar industry.

Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon, Applied
    Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental
    Solutions. A summary of financial information for each
    reportable segment is found in Note 10 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that
    could affect Applied’s operations is set forth under
    “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, which is incorporated
    herein by reference.

Silicon
    Segment

Applied’s Silicon Systems Group (SSG), reported under its
    Silicon segment, develops, manufactures and sells a wide range
    of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor
    chips, also referred to as integrated circuits (ICs). Most chips
    are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of
    circuit components, such as transistors and other devices, that
    are connected by multiple layers of wiring (interconnects).
    Applied offers systems that perform most of the primary
    processes used in chip fabrication including: atomic layer
    deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical
    vapor deposition (PVD), etch, rapid thermal processing (RTP),
    chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) and wafer metrology and
    inspection, as well as systems that etch, clean, measure and
    inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography
    process. Applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are
    used by both integrated device manufacturers and foundries to
    build memory, logic and other types of chips.

To build a chip, the transistors, capacitors and other circuit
    components are first created on the surface of the wafer by
    performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively
    remove portions of successive film layers. Similar processes are
    then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer.
    As the density of the circuit components increases to enable
    greater computing capability in the same or smaller area, the
    complexity of building the chip also increases, necessitating
    more process steps to form smaller structures and more intricate
    wiring schemes. A typical, simplified process sequence for
    building the wiring or interconnect portion of a chip involves
    initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer
    of circuit components using a CVD system. An etch system is then
    used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer. To
    form the metal interconnects, these openings and patterns are
    subsequently filled with conducting material using PVD

and/or

electroplating technologies. A CMP step then polishes the wafer
    to achieve a flat surface. Additional deposition, etch and CMP
    steps are then performed to build up the layers needed to
    complete the interconnection of the circuit elements. Advanced
    chip designs require about 500 steps involving these and other
    processes to complete the manufacturing cycle.

While some device manufacturers are still using aluminum as the
    main conducting material for building interconnect structures,
    most have transitioned to copper. Copper has lower resistance
    than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller area.
    Applied is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing
    copper-based chips, including equipment for depositing, etching
    and planarizing copper interconnect layers. Complementing the
    transition to copper to improve chip speed is the use of low
    dielectric constant (low k) films to replace silicon
    dioxide material as the insulator between the copper wiring
    structures. Applied also leads the industry in providing systems
    for depositing low k dielectric films.



The transistor is another key area of the chip where
    semiconductor manufacturers are improving their device designs
    to enhance speed. Applied has the industry’s largest
    portfolio of technically advanced products for building smaller
    and faster transistors. One example is strain engineering, a
    technique that stretches or compresses the space between atoms,
    allowing electrical current to flow more quickly, thus greatly
    enhancing chip performance. Multiple strain films are typically
    used in advanced devices since they have an additive effect on
    increasing transistor speed. Applied has a comprehensive
    portfolio of systems to enable these applications using CVD and
    epitaxial deposition technologies.

Most chips currently are fabricated using 65 nanometer (nm) and
    larger linewidth dimensions, although Applied is also working
    with customers on more advanced nodes. Major chipmakers have
    announced that they will be integrating new high dielectric
    constant (high-k) and metal materials and processes in their
    transistor gate structures to increase chip performance and
    reduce power consumption. Applied has a comprehensive portfolio
    of fully characterized processes for building these high-k/metal
    gates. These solutions include an integrated dielectric gate
    stack tool that combines four critical processes in a single
    system, a portfolio of metallization technologies using ALD and
    PVD, and an innovative high temperature etch system.

Most of Applied’s semiconductor equipment products are
    single-wafer systems with multiple process chambers attached to
    a base platform. This enables each wafer to be processed
    separately in its own environment, allowing precise process
    control, while the system’s multiple chambers enable
    simultaneous, high productivity manufacturing. Applied sells
    most of its single-wafer, multi-chamber systems on four basic
    platforms: the
    Centura

®

,

    the
    Endura

®

,

    the
    Producer

®

and the
    Vantage

®

.

    These platforms support ALD, CVD, PVD, etch and RTP technologies.

Over time, the semiconductor industry has migrated to
    increasingly larger wafers to build chips. The predominant or
    common wafer size used today for volume production of advanced
    chips is 300 millimeter (mm), or

12-inch,

wafers. Applied offers a comprehensive range of 300mm systems.
    Applied also offers earlier-generation 200mm systems, as well as
    products and services to support all of its systems, which are
    reported under its Applied Global Services segment.

The following summarizes Applied’s portfolio of products
    and their associated process technology areas reported under its
    Silicon segment.

Deposition

Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a chip. During
    deposition, layers of dielectric (an insulator), barrier, or
    electrically conductive (typically metal) films are deposited or
    grown on a wafer. Applied currently provides equipment to
    perform three types of deposition: ALD, CVD and PVD. In
    addition, Applied’s RTP systems can be used to perform
    certain types of dielectric deposition.

Atomic
    Layer Deposition

ALD is an advanced technology in which atoms are deposited one
    layer at a time to build chip structures. This technology
    enables customers to fabricate thin films of either conducting
    or insulating material with uniform coverage in sub-nanometer
    sized structures. Applied offers ALD chambers for depositing
    tungsten and

high-k/metal

gate films. The Applied Centura
    iSprint

tm

Tungsten system (iSprint) combines an ALD chamber, which
    deposits a tungsten nucleation film, with a CVD tungsten bulk
    fill process in one system. The iSprint is used to form contact
    structures that connect the transistors to the wiring areas of
    the chip. Applied’s high-k/metal gate ALD process is part
    of the Centura Advanced Gate Stack system, which enables a
    single integrated solution for building high-k/metal gate
    structures.

Chemical
    Vapor Deposition

CVD is used by customers to deposit dielectric and metal films
    on a wafer. During the CVD process, gases that contain atoms of
    the material to be deposited react on the wafer surface, forming
    a thin film of solid material. Films deposited by CVD may be
    silicon oxide, single-crystal epitaxial silicon, amorphous
    silicon, silicon nitride, dielectric anti-reflective coatings,
    low k dielectric (for highly efficient insulating materials),
    aluminum, titanium,



titanium nitride, polysilicon, tungsten, refractory metals or
    silicides. Applied offers the following CVD products and
    technologies:

The Applied Producer CVD platform

— This
    high-throughput platform features
    Twin-Chamber

®

modules that have two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up
    to three Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer
    platform, giving it a simultaneous processing capacity of six
    wafers. Many dielectric CVD processes can be performed on this
    platform. The highest productivity model of this system is the
    Applied Producer GT, which has achieved rapid customer
    acceptance due to its fast wafer handling performance and
    compact design.

Low k Dielectric Films

— Low k dielectric
    materials are used in copper-based chip designs to further
    improve interconnect speed. Using conventional CVD equipment,
    the Applied Producer Black
    Diamond

®

family of low k systems provides customers with a proven,
    cost-effective way to integrate a variety of low k films into
    advanced interconnect structures. To further increase the
    performance of the complete multi-layer dielectric structure,
    Applied offers a line of
    BLOK

tm

(barrier low k) films deposited with the Producer system.

Lithography-Enabling Solutions

— Applied offers
    several technologies on the Producer system to help chipmakers
    extend their current 193nm lithography tools, including a line
    of Applied
    APF

tm

(advanced patterning film) films and Applied
    DARC

®

(dielectric anti-reflective coating) films. Together, they
    provide a film stack with the precise dimensional control and
    compatibility needed to cost-effectively pattern nano-scale
    features without additional integration complexity.

Gap Fill Films

— There are many steps during
    the chipmaking process in which very small and deep, or high
    aspect ratio (HAR), structures must be filled void-free with a
    dielectric film. Many of these applications include the
    deposition of silicon oxides in substrate isolation structures,
    contacts and interconnects. The Applied Centura Ultima
    HDP-CVD

®

(high-density plasma CVD) system has been an industry
    workhorse, providing multi-generational gap-fill capability for
    both logic and memory devices. The Company’s Applied
    Producer HARP (high aspect ratio process) provides customers
    with device scaling capability using sub-atmospheric CVD (SACVD)
    technology. In 2008, the Company introduced the Applied Producer
    eHARP, which extends gap-fill capability to 32nm and below by
    enabling the seamless, void-free fill of more tightly packed HAR
    structures.

Strain Engineering Solutions

— The Applied
    Producer HARP system also plays a key role in enhancing
    transistor performance, enabling chipmakers to boost chip speed
    by depositing strain inducing dielectric films. Offering the
    industry’s first integrated stress nitride deposition and
    ultraviolet (UV) cure solution, the Applied Producer Celera CVD
    delivers benchmark levels of high-stress tensile silicon nitride
    films. The Company also offers the Applied Centura SiNgenPlus
    low pressure CVD system for low temperature silicon nitride
    films. Used together, and in conjunction with silicon germanium
    (SiGe) films using Applied’s epitaxial deposition
    technologies, these systems can provide additive strain
    engineering benefits.

Epitaxial Deposition

— Epitaxial silicon
    (epitaxy or epi) is a layer of pure silicon grown in a uniform
    crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high quality base
    for the device circuitry. Epi technology is used in an
    increasing number of integrated circuit devices in both the
    wafer substrate and transistor areas of a chip to enhance speed.
    The Applied Centura Epi system integrates pre- and post-epi
    processes on the same system to improve film quality and reduce
    production costs. This system is also used for SiGe epi
    technology, which reduces power usage and increases speed in
    certain types of advanced chips. For emerging transistor
    designs, the Applied Centura RP Epi system offers selective epi
    processes to enable faster transistor switching through strain
    engineering techniques.

Polysilicon Deposition

— Polysilicon is a type
    of silicon used to form portions of the transistor structure
    within the integrated circuit device. The Applied Centura
    Polygen

tm

LPCVD system is a single-wafer, multi-chamber product that
    deposits thin polysilicon films at high temperatures to create
    transistor gate structures. To address the challenging
    requirements of shrinking gate dimensions, the Applied Centura
    DPN Gate Stack system integrates chambers for decoupled plasma
    nitridation (DPN), RTP anneal and polysilicon deposition on one
    platform to enable superior film quality and material properties.



Aluminum Deposition

— Aluminum (Al) continues
    to be used by several memory manufacturers for interconnects.
    The Applied Endura iFill Al CVD/PVD system is used for building
    high-density interconnects in flash and DRAM memory chips. This
    advanced process, for sub-90nm generations, enables customers to
    replace tungsten structures with aluminum to achieve faster
    chips with fewer steps and less cost.

Tungsten Deposition

— Tungsten is used in the
    contact area of a chip that connects the transistors to the
    wiring circuitry. In aluminum-based devices, tungsten is also
    used in the structures that connect the multiple layers of
    aluminum wiring. Applied has two products for depositing
    tungsten: the Applied Centura
    Sprint

®

Tungsten CVD system for 90nm and below devices and the Applied
    Centura iSprint ALD/CVD system for more advanced applications.
    The latter product combines ALD technology and CVD chambers on
    the same platform.

Physical
    Vapor Deposition

PVD is a physical process in which atoms of a gas, such as
    argon, are accelerated toward a metal target. The metal atoms
    chip off, or sputter away, and are then deposited on the wafer.
    Applied leads the industry in PVD technology with its Applied
    Endura PVD system. This system offers a broad range of advanced
    deposition processes, including aluminum, aluminum alloys,
    cobalt, titanium/titanium nitride, tantalum/tantalum nitride,
    tungsten/tungsten nitride, nickel, vanadium and copper.

The Applied Endura CuBS (copper barrier/seed) PVD system is
    widely used by customers for fabricating copper-based chips.
    Using PVD technology, the system deposits a tantalum-based
    barrier film that prevents copper material from entering other
    areas of the device and then a copper seed layer that primes the
    structure for the subsequent deposition of bulk copper. This
    system also features Activ Pre-clean technology to provide clean
    film interfaces while preserving the k-value integrity of the
    structure.

Etch

Etching is used many times throughout the integrated circuit
    manufacturing process to selectively remove material from the
    surface of a wafer. Before etching begins, the wafer is coated
    with a light-sensitive film, called photoresist. A
    photolithography process then projects the circuit pattern onto
    the wafer. Etching removes material only from areas dictated by
    the photoresist pattern. Applied offers a wide range of systems
    for etching dielectric, metal and silicon films to meet the
    requirements of sub-100nm processing.

For dielectric applications, the Applied Centura
    eMax

®

system etches a broad range of dielectric films in the contact
    and interconnect regions of the chip. Applied’s Producer
    Etch system utilizes the Company’s Twin-Chamber Producer
    platform to target cost-sensitive dielectric etch applications
    in 90nm and below design geometries. To address advanced low k
    etch applications, the Applied Centura
    Enabler

®

Etch system performs etch, strip and clean steps in a single
    chamber. The Enabler’s

all-in-one

capability streamlines the process flow for advanced chip
    designs and significantly reduces operating costs. The Applied
    Centura Carina system uses innovative, high-temperature
    technology to deliver the etch capability essential for scaling
    logic and memory devices with high-k/metal gates at 45nm and
    below.

The Applied Centura
    AdvantEdge

tm

Silicon Etch system offers chipmakers high precision gate
    etching for advanced-generation devices. The Applied Centura
    Mariana Trench Etch system provides customers with the
    capability to scale memory devices by etching 80:1 aspect ratio
    structures. For etching metals, the Applied Opus AdvantEdge
    Metal Etch uses an optimized 5-chamber platform configuration
    that enables customers to extend aluminum interconnect
    technology and productivity to sub-70nm dimensions for flash and
    DRAM memory applications.

Rapid
    Thermal Processing

RTP is a process in which a wafer is subjected to rapid bursts
    of intense heat that can take the wafer from room temperature to
    more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in less than 10 seconds. A rapid
    thermal process is used mainly for modifying the properties of
    deposited films. The Applied Centura
    Radiance

®

Plus

and Applied Vantage
    RadOx

tm

RTP systems feature advanced RTP technology with differing
    platform designs. While the multi-chamber Centura



platform offers exceptional process flexibility, the streamlined
    two-chamber Vantage platform is designed for dedicated
    high-volume manufacturing. These single-wafer RTP systems are
    also used for growing high quality oxide and oxynitride films,
    deposition steps that traditional large batch furnaces can no
    longer achieve with the necessary precision and control. With
    its proprietary radical-based oxidation process, the Applied
    Vantage RadOx system deposits high-performance transistor gate
    oxides with high productivity and low operating cost for flash
    memory applications.

Chemical
    Mechanical Planarization

The CMP process removes material from a wafer to create a flat
    (planarized) surface. This process allows subsequent
    photolithography patterning steps to occur with greater accuracy
    and enables film layers to build with minimal height variations.
    The 300mm Applied
    Reflexion

®

LK system leads the industry in CMP technology with important
    features such as integrated cleaning, film measurement and
    process control capabilities.

Metrology
    and Wafer Inspection

Applied offers several products for measuring features and
    inspecting defects on the wafer during various stages of the
    fabrication process. These systems enable customers to
    characterize and control critical dimension (CD) and defect
    issues, especially at advanced generation technology nodes.

Critical
    Dimension and Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscopes
    (CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)

Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an electron beam to
    form images of microscopic features of a patterned wafer at
    extremely high magnification. Applied’s SEM products
    provide customers with full automation, along with the high
    accuracy and sensitivity needed for measuring very small CDs.
    The Applied
    VeritySEM

®

Metrology system uses proprietary SEM imaging technology to
    enable precise control of the lithography and etching processes.
    The VeritySEM measures CDs with less than 5 angstrom precision,
    a requirement for 45nm device production, and incorporates
    automation and software advancements for significantly higher
    throughput in production. Applied’s OPC
    Check

tm

software for the VeritySEM system performs automated
    qualification of OPC-based (optical proximity correction) chip
    designs, significantly reducing mask (see Mask Making section
    below) verification time over conventional manual methods.

DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (such as particles,
    scratches or residues) that are first located by a defect
    detection system and then classify the defects to identify their
    source. The high-throughput, fully automatic Applied
    SEMVision

tm

Defect Analysis products enable customers to use this technology
    as an integral part of their production lines to analyze defects
    as small as 30nm with industry-leading throughput. The Applied
    SEMVision FIB integrates advanced defect review SEM capability
    with automated focused ion beam (FIB) technology in one system.
    The FIB provides a cross-sectional view of the defects reviewed
    by the SEM, enabling chipmakers to analyze the defects in
    minutes as part of their in-line review process.

Wafer
    Inspection

Using laser-based technology, defects can be detected on
    patterned wafers (wafers with printed circuit images) as they
    move between processing steps. Defects include particles, open
    circuit lines, and shorts between lines. Incorporating key
    advances in imaging technology, the Applied
    ComPlus

tm

Inspection system, for darkfield applications, detects defects
    in devices with design rules of 65nm and below with the high
    speed required for customers’ volume production lines. The
    Applied
    UVision

tm

Inspection system is the industry’s first laser-based,
    three dimensional brightfield tool. Utilizing multi-beam, deep
    ultraviolet (DUV) laser illumination and high efficiency
    detectors, the UVision system uncovers previously undetectable
    defects on the wafer, enabling customers to rapidly resolve
    defect issues and achieve greater chip yields.

Mask
    Making

Masks are used by photolithography systems to transfer
    microscopic circuit designs onto wafers. Since an imperfection
    in a mask may be replicated on the wafer, the mask must be
    virtually defect-free. Applied provides systems for etching,
    cleaning and inspecting masks.



The Applied Tetra III Advanced Reticle Etch system, an
    advanced etch tool for fabricating leading-edge masks, is used
    by virtually every advanced mask maker in the world for 45nm
    photomask development and production. In 2008, the Company
    introduced the Applied
    Tetra

    Applied’s Advanced Wafer Reclaim Center in Taiwan uses
    state-of-the-art manufacturing systems and software to extend
    the lifecycle of 300mm silicon test wafers by over 45% and to
    reduce customers’ costs.

In 2008, the Company introduced its
    SunFab

tm

Performance Service program, a comprehensive, integrated support
    solution for Applied’s
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line for producing large-size solar PV panels,
    discussed further under the Energy and Environmental Solutions
    segment. The first service product of its kind for the solar
    industry, the program enables customers to quickly ramp to
    volume production while optimizing the performance, cost and
    output of their SunFab lines.

Mature Technology Services

— Applied offers a
    wide range of products and services to extend the productive
    life of 200mm semiconductor fabs, including new and
    remanufactured 200mm equipment, system enhancements and fab
    transition services. Designed to maximize productivity and lower
    cost of ownership, these products also assist customers in
    implementing green manufacturing solutions. Applied’s 200mm
    systems are available in a broad range of production-proven
    technologies, including CVD, PVD, etch, implant, RTP, CMP,
    epitaxy, metrology and inspection tools.

Automation Systems

— Applied offers automated
    factory-level and tool-level control software systems for
    semiconductor, LCD and solar cell manufacturing facilities.
    These enterprise solutions include manufacturing execution
    systems (MES) to automate the production of wafers and LCD and
    solar substrates, advanced process control systems, and
    scheduling and materials handling control systems. Applied also
    offers computerized maintenance management systems, performance
    tracking, and modeling and simulation tools for improving asset
    utilization. In 2008, Applied introduced its breakthrough E3
    equipment engineering system solution that uniquely integrates
    all critical equipment automation and process control components.

Abatement Systems

— Applied’s family of
    Metron abatement systems is a comprehensive line of
    environmental solutions for the semiconductor, solar and display
    industries. These systems include a wide range of point-of-use
    scrubbing tools including wet, dry, thermal and integrated
    technologies for reliable, cost-effective abatement of exhaust
    gases. In 2008, the Company introduced the Marathon S for its
    SunFab Thin Film line, the only integrated solution for PECVD
    reactive byproducts.



Display
    Segment

Applied’s AKT subsidiary, reported under the Display
    segment, designs, manufactures and sells equipment to fabricate
    thin film transistor LCDs for televisions, computer displays and
    other consumer-oriented electronic applications. While
    similarities exist between the technologies utilized in
    chipmaking and LCD fabrication, the most significant differences
    are in the size and composition of the substrate. Substrates
    used to manufacture LCD panels can be more than 70 times larger
    in area than 300mm wafers and are made of glass, while wafers
    are made of silicon. This technology for deposition on
    large-size substrates is also used in the Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line.

Applied supplies a wide range of systems that process and test
    different glass substrate sizes. For fabricating the transistor
    layer of these panels, the Company offers a line of
    plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) systems that use multi-chamber
    platform architecture to deposit dielectric and semiconducting
    films. The
    AKT-PiVot

tm

55KV system employs high-productivity, cost-efficient PVD
    technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide
    films on the substrate. For manufacturing the color filter of
    LCD panels, Applied offers the AKT-NEW
    ARISTO

tm

2200 for transparent conductive oxide film deposition.

Complementing these systems, Applied also offers a line of
    electron beam test (EBT) systems for testing substrates during
    production for defective pixels and other imperfections.
    Featuring one of the industry’s fastest and most accurate
    pixel test technologies with the lowest operating cost, the EBT
    systems’ non-contact test technology enables the safe
    testing of high-value LCD TV panels without damaging or
    scratching the display.

To meet growing consumer demand for larger, more cost-efficient
    LCD TVs, LCD manufacturers have moved to increasingly
    large-sized substrates. Applied’s latest generation (Gen)
    10 systems can process substrates sized at approximately 2.85 x
    3.05 meters, with each substrate enabling the production of up
    to six

65-inch

LCD
    TV screens. These Gen-10 systems include the AKT-90K PECVD and
    the Gen-10 AKT-90K EBT products, announced in fiscal 2008.

Energy
    and Environmental Solutions Segment

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes
    manufacturing solutions for the generation and conservation of
    energy. Applied entered the solar PV market in 2006, announcing
    its objective to lower the overall cost per watt of solar
    electricity to parity with that of electricity generated by
    other sources such as the burning of fossil fuels. Applied
    offers manufacturing solutions for both wafer-based crystalline
    silicon (c-Si) and glass-based thin film applications to enable
    customers to increase the conversion efficiency and yields of
    solar PV devices.

In fiscal 2008, Applied expanded its capabilities and
    opportunities in the c-Si technology sector through its
    acquisition of Baccini S.p.A. (Baccini), a leading supplier of
    automated metallization and test systems for c-Si solar PV
    cells. These products, combined with Applied’s suite of
    silicon wafering and deposition systems, have made Applied the
    leading supplier of c-Si manufacturing systems worldwide. A key
    benefit of these systems is that they offer customers a way to
    reduce silicon consumption and cost by using ultra-thin
    substrate wafers.

For thin film applications, Applied developed the Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line, which is the world’s only integrated
    production line for manufacturing thin film silicon solar
    modules using 5.7 square meter
    (m


)

    glass substrates. These ultra-large panels, which are
    approximately four times the size of thin film solar panels
    offered by others in the industry, are intended for large-scale
    applications such as solar farms, utilities and
    building-integrated solar PV system installations. Applied has
    entered into multiple contracts for its SunFab line with
    customers in Europe, Asia and Saudi Arabia. In October 2008, the
    first of these lines passed final acceptance testing, enabling
    the customer to begin volume manufacturing of SunFab modules.

Products in this segment also include the
    ATON

tm

in-line deposition system, a large-area platform for
    high-quality deposition and high-throughput in both c-Si and
    thin film solar PV cell manufacturing, as well as processes,
    materials-handling technologies and fabrication services. Other
    products include roll-to-roll, vacuum web coating systems for
    high-performance deposition of a range of films on flexible
    substrates for functional, aesthetic or optical properties.
    Applied also offers large-area deposition equipment for the
    production of low-emissivity (low-E) and solar control
    architectural glass.



Backlog

Applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order
    backlog and customer commitments. Backlog consists of:
    (1) orders for which written authorizations have been
    accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next
    12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not
    been recognized; (2) contractual service revenue and
    maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months;
    and (3) orders for SunFab lines that are anticipated to be
    recognized as revenue within the next 12 months.

Applied’s backlog increased from $3.7 billion at
    October 28, 2007 to $4.8 billion at October 26,
    2008. Applied’s backlog on any particular date is not
    necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding
    period. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel
    orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation
    penalties. Backlog adjustments were positive for fiscal 2008 and
    totaled $140 million, consisting primarily of backlog
    obtained from acquired companies, partially offset by
    cancellations and currency adjustments. Delays in delivery
    schedules

and/or

a
    reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a
    material adverse effect on Applied’s business and results
    of operations.

Manufacturing,
    Raw Materials and Supplies

Applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of
    procurement, assembly, test and integration of various
    proprietary and commercial parts, components and subassemblies
    (collectively, parts) that are used to manufacture systems.
    Products in the Silicon segment are manufactured in Austin,
    Texas and Rehovot, Israel. Remanufactured products in the
    Applied Global Services segment are produced primarily in
    Austin, Texas. Products in the Display segment are manufactured
    in Santa Clara, California; Alzenau, Germany; and Tainan,
    Taiwan. Products in the Energy and Environmental Solutions
    segment are manufactured primarily in Alzenau, Germany;
    Cheseaux, Switzerland; Treviso, Italy; and Santa Clara,
    California. Manufacturing requires raw materials, including a
    wide variety of mechanical and electrical components, to be
    manufactured to Applied’s specifications. Applied uses
    numerous companies, including contract manufacturers, to supply
    parts for the manufacture and support of its products. Although
    Applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are
    available from multiple qualified suppliers, this is not always
    possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be obtained from only
    a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Applied seeks
    to reduce costs and to lower the risks of production and service
    interruptions, as well as shortages of key parts, by:
    (1) selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key
    parts; (2) monitoring the financial condition of key
    suppliers; (3) maintaining appropriate inventories of key
    parts; (4) qualifying new parts on a timely basis; and
    (5) locating certain manufacturing operations in areas that
    are closer to suppliers and customers.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s long-term growth strategy requires continued
    development of new products. Applied’s significant
    investment in research, development and engineering (RD&E)
    has generally enabled it to deliver new products and
    technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus
    allowing customers to incorporate these products into their
    manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology
    selection cycle. Applied works closely with its global customers
    to design systems and processes that meet their planned
    technical and production requirements. Product development and
    engineering organizations are located primarily in the United
    States, as well as in Europe, Israel and China. In addition,
    Applied outsources certain RD&E activities, some of which
    are performed outside the United States. Process support and
    customer demonstration laboratories are located in the United
    States, China, Europe and Israel.

Applied’s investments in RD&E for product development
    and engineering programs to create or improve products and
    technologies over the last three years were as follows:
    $1.1 billion (14 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2008,
    $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2007
    and $1.2 billion (13 percent of net sales) in fiscal
    2006. Applied has spent an average of 13 percent of net
    sales in RD&E over the last five years. In addition to
    RD&E for specific product technologies, Applied maintains
    ongoing programs for automation control systems, materials
    research and environmental control that have applications to its
    products. In fiscal 2008, Applied focused on developing systems
    for semiconductor customers’ new chip designs with 45nm and
    below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors
    using strain engineering and high-k/metal gate technologies, as
    well as double



patterning processes that enable customers to extend their
    existing 193nm lithography tools through additional technology
    generations. Applied also focused on developing technology for
    through-silicon vias, an emerging solution for interconnecting
    three dimensional chip stacks to provide better device
    performance, lower power consumption and the integration of
    heterogeneous devices. RD&E also included activities to
    develop products that enable lower-cost production of solar
    energy.

Marketing
    and Sales

Because of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied
    markets and sells products worldwide through a direct sales
    force. Approximately 81 percent of Applied’s fiscal
    2008 net sales were to regions outside of the
    United States. Net sales to customers by region as a
    percentage of total net sales were: Taiwan 22 percent,
    North America (primarily the United States)
    19 percent, Asia-Pacific (including China) 16 percent,
    Korea 16 percent, Japan 15 percent, and Europe
    12 percent.

General economic conditions impact Applied’s business and
    financial results. From time to time, the markets in which
    products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may
    negatively impact sales. Applied’s business is usually not
    seasonal in nature, but it is cyclical, based on capital
    equipment investment by major semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar PV and other manufacturers. These expenditures depend on
    many factors, including: anticipated market demand and pricing
    for semiconductors, LCDs, solar cells and modules, architectural
    glass and other substrates; the development of new technologies;
    customers’ factory utilization; capital resources and
    financing; and global and regional economic conditions.

Applied manages its business and reports financial results based
    on the segments described above, but does not allocate certain
    sales and marketing costs to the segments.

Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and
    long-lived assets attributable to Applied’s geographic
    regions is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. accounted
    for 16 percent of Applied’s net sales in fiscal 2008,
    12 percent of Applied’s net sales in fiscal 2007, and
    11 percent of Applied’s net sales in fiscal 2006.
    These net sales were for products in multiple reportable
    segments.

Competition

The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive
    and characterized by rapid technological change. Applied’s
    ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely
    commercialize its technology, continually improve its products
    and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer
    requirements. Significant competitive factors include technical
    capability and differentiation, productivity and
    cost-effectiveness. The importance of these factors varies
    according to customers’ needs, including product mix and
    respective product requirements, applications, and the timing
    and circumstances of purchasing decisions. Substantial
    competition exists in all areas of Applied’s business.
    Competitors range from small companies that compete with a
    single product

and/or

in a
    single region, to global, diversified companies with a range of
    products. Applied’s ability to compete requires a high
    level of investment in RD&E and in marketing, sales and
    global customer support activities. Management believes that
    many of Applied’s products have strong competitive
    positions.

The competitive environment for each segment is described below:

The semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by
    consumer demand for lower-cost electronic products with
    increased capability and, to a lesser extent, by demand for
    commercial applications. As a result, products within the
    Silicon segment are subject to rapid changes in customer
    requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, new
    materials and an increasing number of applications. While
    certain existing technologies may be adapted to new
    requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely
    different technical approach. The rapid pace of technological
    change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies
    and products and create opportunities for existing and new
    competitors. Applied offers a broad portfolio of technically
    differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy
    customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively.
    Applied allocates resources among its many product offerings and
    therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to
    the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products.
    There are many competitors serving the semiconductor
    manufacturing equipment industry, with some offering a single
    product line and others offering



multiple product lines. These competitors range from suppliers
    serving a single region to global, diversified companies.

Products and services within the Applied Global Services segment
    are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements
    and a diverse group of numerous competitors. To compete
    effectively, Applied offers products and services to reduce
    costs, improve productivity, and lessen the environmental impact
    of customers’ fab operations. Significant competitive
    factors include productivity, cost-effectiveness, and the level
    of technical service and support. The importance of these
    factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type
    of products or services offered.

Products in the Display segment are subject to strong
    competition from a number of major competitors. Applied holds
    established market positions with its technically differentiated
    LCD manufacturing solutions for PECVD, color filter PVD and
    array testing, although its market position can change rapidly
    if it does not meet customers’ requirements. In fiscal
    2007, Applied entered the array PVD market with the
    AKT-PiVot

tm

55KV PVD system. As a recent entrant to this market, Applied
    faces significant competition from existing array PVD suppliers.

Applied’s products within the Energy and Environmental
    Solutions segment compete in diverse market areas, including
    equipment to make solar PV cells and modules, flexible
    electronics and energy-efficient glass. In solar, Applied offers
    products for two distinct technologies, c-Si wafer-based and
    thin film glass-based applications. As a recent entrant to the
    solar equipment business, Applied competes with many other
    companies that have more experience with solar applications.
    Applied also is a recent entrant to the flexible electronics
    equipment business, which operates in an emerging market sector
    characterized by diverse types of applications, customer
    requirements and competitors. Applied’s glass coating
    equipment faces significant competition from at least one
    established supplier and another recent market entrant.

Patents
    and Licenses

Management believes that Applied’s competitive position
    significantly depends upon the Company’s research,
    development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing
    capabilities, and not just on its patent position. However,
    protection of Applied’s technological assets by obtaining
    and enforcing intellectual property rights, including patents,
    is important. Therefore, Applied’s practice is to file
    patent applications in the United States and other countries for
    inventions that Applied considers significant. Applied has a
    substantial number of patents in the United States and other
    countries, and additional applications are pending for new
    inventions. Although Applied does not consider its business
    materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Applied
    and the products made and sold under its patents, taken as a
    whole, are a significant element of Applied’s business. In
    addition to patents, Applied also possesses other intellectual
    property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets and
    copyrights.

Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements
    with other companies when management determines that it is in
    its best interest to do so. Applied pays royalties under
    existing patent license agreements for the use, in several of
    its products, of certain patented technologies that are licensed
    to Applied for the life of the patents. Applied also receives
    royalties from licenses granted to third parties. Royalties
    received from or paid to third parties have not been, and are
    not expected to be, material to Applied’s consolidated
    results of operations.

In the normal course of business, Applied periodically receives
    and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In
    dealing with such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful
    for Applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights.
    However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights
    will be available to Applied on commercially reasonable terms,
    or at all. If Applied is not able to resolve or settle claims,
    obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms,

and/or

successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Environmental
    Matters

Two of Applied’s locations have been designated as
    environmental cleanup sites. In 1987, the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency designated one of the locations,
    in Santa Clara, California, as a Superfund site and named
    Applied as a “Responsible Party.” Cleanup activities
    at this site began in 1984 and were substantially



completed in February 2002. The California Regional Water
    Quality Control Board designated Applied as a
    “Discharger” with respect to another site in
    Sunnyvale, California. Applied was named a Discharger upon its
    acquisition of the property in 1997 solely due to its status as
    property owner. The prior owners of the site

and/or

operators who caused the contamination are responsible for
    performing cleanup and monitoring activities.

Applied maintains a number of environmental, health and safety
    programs that are primarily preventive in nature. As part of
    these programs, Applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance
    and periodically conducts investigations of possible
    contamination.

Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating
    the discharge of materials into the environment, remedial
    agreements and other actions relating to the environment have
    not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on
    Applied’s capital expenditures, competitive position,
    financial condition or results of operations.

The most recent report on Applied’s environmental, health
    and safety activities can be found on the Company’s website

Employees

At October 26, 2008, Applied employed 14,824 regular
    employees and 586 temporary employees. In the high-technology
    industry, competition for highly-skilled employees is intense.
    Applied believes that its future success is highly dependent
    upon its continued ability to attract, retain and motivate
    qualified employees. There can be no assurance that Applied will
    be able to attract, hire, assimilate and retain a sufficient
    number of qualified employees.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

The following factors could materially affect Applied’s
    business, financial condition or results of operations and
    should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its
    business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere
    in this report.

The
    industries that Applied serves are volatile and
    unpredictable.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar and related industries, Applied is subject to business
    cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be
    difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These
    industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes
    in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and
    spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand
    for customers’ products, inventory levels relative to
    demand, and access to affordable capital. These changes have
    affected the timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and
    investments in technology, and continue to affect Applied’s
    orders, net sales, operating expenses and net income.

To meet rapidly changing demand in each of the industries it
    serves, Applied must effectively manage its resources and
    production capacity for each of its segments and across multiple
    segments. During periods of decreasing demand for Applied’s
    products, Applied must be able to appropriately align its cost
    structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage
    its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. During
    periods of increasing demand, Applied must have sufficient
    manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer



demand; effectively manage its supply chain; and attract, retain
    and motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If
    Applied is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes
    in its business environment, Applied’s business, financial
    condition or results of operations may be materially and
    adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with the ongoing financial crisis
    and weakening global economy.

The recent severe tightening of the credit markets, turmoil in
    the financial markets, and weakening global economy are
    contributing to slowdowns in the industries in which Applied
    operates, which slowdowns are expected to worsen if these
    economic conditions are prolonged or deteriorate further. The
    markets for semiconductors and flat panel displays in particular
    depend largely on consumer spending. Economic uncertainty
    exacerbates negative trends in consumer spending and may cause
    certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from
    placing equipment or service orders, which may affect
    Applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales and reduce
    net sales. Difficulties in obtaining capital and deteriorating
    market conditions may also lead to the inability of some
    customers to obtain affordable financing, resulting in lower
    sales for Applied. Customers with liquidity issues may lead to
    additional bad debt expense for Applied. These conditions may
    also similarly affect key suppliers, which could affect their
    ability to deliver parts and result in delays for Applied’s
    products. Further, these conditions and uncertainty about future
    economic conditions make it challenging for Applied to forecast
    its operating results, make business decisions, and identify the
    risks that may affect its business, financial condition and
    results of operations. In addition, Applied maintains an
    investment portfolio that is subject to general credit,
    liquidity, market and interest rate risks that may be
    exacerbated by deteriorating financial market conditions and, as
    a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio
    could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment. If Applied
    is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes
    resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment,
    Applied’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the
    various industries in which it operates.

The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related
    industries in which Applied operates are characterized by
    ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries,
    including:

•

increasing capital requirements for building and operating new
    fabrication plants and the resulting effect on customers’
    ability to raise the necessary capital;

•

the varying growth rates of the semiconductor, display and solar
    equipment industries;

•

the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from
    product design to volume manufacturing and the resulting impact
    on new technology adoption rates;

•

the importance of reducing the total cost of system ownership,
    due in part to the increasing significance of lower-cost
    consumer electronics as a driver for semiconductor and LCD
    demand;

•

fluctuating levels of business information technology spending;

•

the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and
    productivity and the effect on demand for systems as a result of
    their increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;

•

demand for shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture
    and installation of manufacturing equipment;

•

price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, LCDs and
    solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such
    products;

•

the increasing importance of spare parts availability to
    maximize system uptime;

•

the increasing role for and complexity of software; and

•

the increasing focus on energy usage, the environment and
    sustainability.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor, flat panel
    display, solar and related industries, its business, financial
    condition and results of operations could be materially and
    adversely affected.



Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to
    the semiconductor industry.

The largest portion of Applied’s revenues historically has
    come from sales of manufacturing equipment to the global
    semiconductor industry, and this business historically has also
    been the most profitable. Changes in the semiconductor industry
    may lead to a decrease in the percentage of Applied’s
    revenue attributable to its semiconductor equipment business as
    a percentage of overall revenue, which in turn can negatively
    impact the Company’s net income. In addition to the general
    industry changes described in the preceding risk factor, the
    semiconductor industry is characterized by ongoing changes
    particular to that industry, including:

•

the increasing cost of semiconductor R&D due to many
    factors, including decreasing linewidths, the increasing number
    of materials, device structures, applications and process steps,
    and the increasing cost, complexity and integration of
    manufacturing process development and chip design;

•

the growing types and varieties of semiconductors and expanding
    number of applications across multiple substrate sizes,
    resulting in divergent technical demands;

•

differing rates of market growth for, and capital investments
    by, various semiconductor device makers, such as memory
    (including NAND flash and DRAM), logic and foundry;

•

the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor
    manufacturers to move volume manufacturing from one technology
    node to the next smaller technology node, and the resulting
    impact on the technology transition rate and the rate of
    investment in capital equipment;

•

the effect of the decreasing number of new chip designs on the
    rate of capital equipment investment;

•

technology changes in related markets, such as lithography;

•

the increasing fragmentation of certain markets for
    semiconductors and the resulting effect on the number of
    individual markets that have the ability to financially justify
    the cost of a new fabrication plant;

•

the cost, technical complexity and timing of a proposed
    transition from 300 mm to 450 mm wafers; and

•

increasing costs, complexity and competitiveness in the
    semiconductor industry that has resulted in the decreasing
    profitability of many manufacturers, causing them to enter into
    collaboration, cooperation or cost-sharing arrangements with
    other manufacturers, to outsource some or all manufacturing
    activities, or to focus on particular markets or applications.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to
    the flat panel display industry.

The global flat panel display industry historically has
    experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment
    investment levels, due in part to the limited number of LCD
    manufacturers and the concentrated nature of LCD end-use
    applications. Recently, industry growth has depended to a
    considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger
    and more advanced TVs. In addition to the general industry
    changes described above in the third risk factor, the display
    industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that
    industry. These include technical and financial difficulties
    associated with transitioning to larger substrate sizes for
    LCDs, as well as the effect of a slowing rate of transition to
    larger substrate sizes on capital intensity and product
    differentiation. If Applied does not successfully manage the
    risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the
    display industry, its business, financial condition and results
    of operations could be materially and adversely affected.



Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to
    the solar industry.

An increasing portion of Applied’s business is in the
    emerging solar market, which Applied entered in 2006 and which,
    in addition to the general industry changes described above in
    the third risk factor, is characterized by ongoing changes
    particular to the solar industry, including:

•

changes in demand for solar PV products arising from, among
    other things, the cost and performance of solar PV technology
    compared to other energy sources;

•

the adequacy of or changes in government energy policies,
    including the availability and amount of government incentives
    for solar power;

•

the extent of investment or participation in solar by utilities
    or other companies that generate, transmit or distribute power
    to end users;

•

evolving industry standards;

•

difficulties associated with establishing a standard form factor
    for thin film solar modules;

•

regulatory requirements and customers’ ability to timely
    satisfy these requirements;

•

a requirement of certification by third parties in certain
    circumstances;

•

customers’ and end-users’ access to affordable
    financial capital; and

•

the move to increasingly greater factory output of solar PVs,
    including output on a level sufficient to annually generate
    electricity on a gigawatt scale.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to
    competition and rapid technological changes.

As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment, its
    future success depends on many factors, including the effective
    commercialization and customer acceptance of its
    nanomanufacturing technology equipment, service and related
    products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its
    growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing
    markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets
    and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving
    its operational performance. The development, introduction and
    support of a broadening set of products in more varied
    competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and
    expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may
    involve higher costs and reduced profits. Applied’s success
    is subject to many risks, including but not limited to its
    ability to timely, cost-effectively and successfully:

•

develop new products, improve

and/or

develop new applications for existing products, and adapt
    similar products for use by customers in different applications

and/or

markets with varying technical requirements;

•

appropriately price and achieve market acceptance of products;

•

differentiate its products from those of competitors and any
    disruptive technologies, meet performance specifications, and
    drive efficiencies and cost reductions;

•

maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to
    different markets, customers and applications;

•

appropriately allocate resources, including R&D funding,
    among Applied’s products and between the development of new
    products and the enhancement of existing products;

•

accurately forecast demand and meet production schedules for its
    products;

•

improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost
    efficiencies across product offerings;

•

adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different
    parts of the supply chain;

•

qualify products for volume manufacturing with its customers;



•

implement changes in its design engineering methodology,
    including those that enable reduction of material costs and
    cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts
    used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life
    cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental
    impact; and

•

successfully accomplish the simultaneous

start-up

of
    multiple integrated thin film solar production lines.

If Applied does not successfully manage these challenges, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

The
    entry into new markets and industries entails additional
    challenges.

As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand
    into related or new markets and industries, either with its
    existing nanomanufacturing technology products or with new
    products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions.
    The entry into different markets involves additional challenges,
    including those arising from:

•

Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on
    opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;

•

the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations
    in production planning, execution, supply chain management and
    logistics;

•

the adoption of new business models, such as the supply of an
    integrated production line consisting of a suite of Applied and
    non-Applied equipment to manufacture solar PVs;

•

the need to develop adequate new business processes and systems;

•

Applied’s ability to rapidly expand its operations to meet
    increased demand and the associated effect on Applied’s
    working capital;

•

new materials, processes and technologies;

•

the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills
    and expertise in these new areas;

•

new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some
    with limited operating histories, uncertain

and/or

limited funding, evolving business models

and/or

locations in regions where Applied does not have existing
    operations;

•

different customer service requirements;

•

new

and/or

different competitors with potentially more financial or other
    resources and industry experience;

•

entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels
    of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business
    and employment practices;

•

third parties’ intellectual property rights; and

•

the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry
    standards and practices.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    its entry into new markets and industries, its business,
    financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to the risks of operating a global
    business.

In fiscal 2008, approximately 81 percent of Applied’s
    net sales were to customers in regions outside the
    United States, with a majority of business from customers
    in Asia. Certain of Applied’s R&D

and/or

manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are
    also located outside the United States, including in China. The
    global nature of Applied’s business and operations presents
    challenges, including but not limited to those arising from:

•

varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and
    demands;

•

variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or
    international laws and regulations (including tax and import and
    export restrictions), as well as the interpretation and
    application of such laws and regulations;

•

global trade issues, including those related to the
    interpretation and application of import and export licenses;

•

variations in protection of intellectual property and other
    legal rights;



•

positions taken by U.S. governmental agencies regarding
    possible national commercial

and/or

security issues posed by international business operations;

•

fluctuating raw material and energy costs;

•

variations in the ability to develop relationships with
    suppliers and other local businesses;

•

fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates,
    including the relative position of the U.S. dollar;

•

the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in
    different locations;

•

political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes,
    floods or storms), pandemics, terrorism or acts of war in
    locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales;

•

cultural differences;

•

customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the
    development and growth of local competitors;

•

shipping costs

and/or

delays;

•

uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various
    countries; and

•

uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture
    and sales of semiconductors, LCDs and solar cells in the
    developing economies of certain countries.

Many of these challenges are present in China, which is
    experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and
    competitors to Applied, and which Applied believes presents a
    large potential market for its products and opportunity for
    growth over the long term. In addition, Applied must regularly
    reassess the size, capability and location of its global
    infrastructure and make appropriate changes. These challenges
    may materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated
    customer base.

Applied’s semiconductor and flat panel display customer
    bases historically have been, and are becoming even more, highly
    concentrated. In addition, certain customers have entered into
    strategic alliances or industry consortia that have increased
    the influence of key industry participants in technology
    decisions made by their partners. In the solar area, while the
    number of solar PV manufacturing customers is increasing as the
    number of market entrants grows, the size of contracts with
    particular customers is expected to rise substantially as the
    industry moves to greater solar module factory output capacity,
    including capacity sufficient to annually generate electricity
    on a gigawatt scale. In this environment, contracts or orders
    from a relatively limited number of semiconductor, display and
    solar manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to
    continue to account for, a substantial portion of Applied’s
    business. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales
    to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders,
    or they delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to
    replace the business. As Applied’s products are configured
    to customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling
    orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major
    customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing,
    payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial
    terms that are less favorable to Applied. In addition, certain
    customers have undergone significant ownership

and/or

management changes, and outsourced manufacturing activities,
    have engaged in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with
    other customers or have consolidated with other customers, which
    may result in additional complexities in managing customer
    relationships and transactions. These factors could have a
    material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic
    investments.

Applied has made, and in the future intends to make,
    acquisitions of, and investments in, companies, technologies or
    products in existing, related or new markets for Applied.
    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited
    to:

•

diversion of management’s attention from other operational
    matters;

•

inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all;



•

inability to realize anticipated benefits;

•

failure to commercialize purchased technologies;

•

inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that
    may be significantly different from Applied’s existing
    markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions;

•

exposure to operational risks, rules and regulations to the
    extent such activities are located in countries where Applied
    has not historically conducted business;

•

challenges associated with managing larger, more diverse and
    more widespread operations;

•

inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in
    key technologies;

•

ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal controls;

•

impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of
    technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of
    the acquired company or its product offerings;

•

unknown, underestimated

and/or

undisclosed commitments or liabilities;

•

inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical
    resources or facilities for business needs; and

•

ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies,
    products or employees of the acquired companies.

Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies,
    including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline
    in value

and/or

not
    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments
    depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited
    or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures,
    requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic
    partners. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are
    inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to
    effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely
    affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

Manufacturing
    interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to
    meet customer demand, while the failure to estimate customer
    demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete
    inventory.

Applied’s business depends on its ability to supply
    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly
    changing technical and volume requirements of its customers,
    which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts,
    components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from
    suppliers. Some key parts may be subject to long lead-times

and/or

obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of
    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by
    suppliers located in countries other than the United States,
    including China. Applied may experience significant
    interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its
    ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or
    customer order cancellations as a result of:

•

the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality
    parts;

•

volatility in the availability and cost of materials;

•

difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export
    approvals;

•

information technology or infrastructure failures;

•

natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or
    storms); or

•

other causes (such as regional economic downturns, pandemics,
    political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), could result
    in delayed deliveries, manufacturing inefficiencies, increased
    costs or order cancellations.

In addition, Applied’s need to rapidly increase its
    business and manufacturing capacity to meet unanticipated
    increases in demand may exacerbate any interruptions in
    Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and the
    associated effect on Applied’s working capital. Moreover,
    if actual demand for Applied’s products is different than
    expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts than necessary
    or incur costs for canceling, postponing or expediting delivery
    of parts. The volatility of demand for capital equipment
    increases capital, technical and other risks for companies in
    the supply chain. Any or all of these factors could materially
    and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations.



The
    failure to successfully implement and conduct off-shoring and
    outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could
    adversely affect results of operations.

To better align its costs with market conditions, increase its
    presence in growing markets, enhance productivity, and improve
    efficiencies, Applied conducts engineering, software development
    and other operations in regions outside the United States,
    particularly India and China, and outsources certain functions
    to third parties, including companies in the United States,
    India, China and other countries. Outsourced functions include
    certain engineering, manufacturing, customer support, software
    development, information technology support, finance and
    administrative activities. The expanding role of third party
    providers has required changes to Applied’s existing
    operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for
    retaining and managing these providers in order to realize the
    potential productivity and operational efficiencies, assure
    quality and continuity of supply, and protect Applied’s
    intellectual property. In addition, Applied has implemented
    several key operational initiatives intended to improve
    manufacturing efficiency, including integrate-to-order,
    module-final-test and

merge-in-transit

programs. Applied also is implementing a multi-year,
    company-wide program to transform certain business processes,
    which includes transitioning to a single enterprise resource
    planning (ERP) software system to perform various functions. The
    conversion to this new ERP system will include certain risks,
    including difficulties with data integrity and business
    interruption.

If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its
    off-shoring and outsourcing strategies, if required export and
    other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if
    Applied’s third party providers do not perform as
    anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in
    implementing a new ERP system or enhancing business processes,
    Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or
    cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties,
    increased costs (including energy and transportation),
    manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the
    structure

and/or

operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property
    rights, quality issues, increased product time-to-market

and/or

inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which
    could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

The
    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital
    to Applied’s success.

Applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part
    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.
    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,
    including fluctuations in global economic and industry
    conditions, changes in Applied’s management or leadership,
    competitors’ hiring practices, cost reduction activities,
    and the effectiveness of Applied’s compensation programs,
    including its equity-based programs. Applied periodically
    evaluates its overall compensation program and makes
    adjustments, as appropriate, to enhance its competitiveness. If
    Applied does not successfully attract, retain and motivate key
    employees, Applied may be unable to capitalize on its
    opportunities and its operating results may be materially and
    adversely affected.

Changes
    in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect results of
    operations.

As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the
    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment
    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
    Applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be
    affected by numerous factors, including changes in the:
    (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of pre-tax
    income in countries with differing tax rates; or
    (3) valuation of Applied’s deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. In addition, Applied is subject to regular
    examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
    authorities. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of
    favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these
    examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for
    income taxes. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are
    reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final
    determination will not be materially different from the
    treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax
    provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely
    affect Applied’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or
    claims and protection of intellectual property
    rights.

Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved
    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,
    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental
    regulations, securities, contracts, product



performance, product liability, unfair competition, employment
    and other matters. In addition, Applied on occasion receives
    notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them
    indemnification or other obligations related to claims made
    against customers by third parties. These legal proceedings and
    claims, whether with or without merit, may be time-consuming and
    expensive to prosecute or defend, divert management’s
    attention and resources,

and/or

inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products. There can
    be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal
    proceedings or claims. Applied previously entered into a mutual
    covenant-not-to-sue arrangement with one of its competitors to
    decrease the risk of patent infringement lawsuits in the future.
    There can be no assurance that the intended results of this
    arrangement will be achieved or that Applied will be able to
    adequately protect its intellectual property rights with the
    restrictions associated with such a covenant. In addition,
    Applied’s success depends in significant part on the
    protection of its intellectual property and other rights.
    Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as
    the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare
    parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue
    opportunities for Applied. Applied’s intellectual property
    rights may not provide significant competitive advantages if
    they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the
    rapid pace of technological change, or if Applied does not
    adequately protect or assert these rights. Furthermore, the laws
    and practices of other countries, including China, India, Taiwan
    and Korea, permit the protection and enforcement of
    Applied’s rights to varying extents, which may not be
    sufficient to protect Applied’s rights. If Applied is not
    able to obtain or enforce intellectual property rights, resolve
    or settle claims, obtain necessary licenses on commercially
    reasonable terms,

and/or

successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property
    position, Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and
    safety regulations.

Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in
    connection with its global business operations, including but
    not limited to: regulations related to the development,
    manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of
    materials used in its products or in producing its products; the
    operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property.
    The failure or inability to comply with existing or future
    environmental and safety regulations could result in:
    (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the
    imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of
    the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its
    products; (4) limitations on the operation of its
    facilities or ability to use its real property;

and/or

(5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of
    which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory
    environment.

Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,
    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and
    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies

and/or

regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates;
    (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional
    regulatory agencies related to international trade; and
    (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and
    regulations. If Applied is found by a court or regulatory agency
    not to be in compliance with applicable laws, rules or
    regulations, Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
    Applied must include in its Annual Report on

Form 10-K

a report of management on the effectiveness of Applied’s
    internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance
    with this requirement is complex, costly and time-consuming. If
    Applied fails to maintain effective internal control over
    financial reporting or Applied’s management does not timely
    assess the adequacy of such internal control, Applied could be
    subject to regulatory sanctions and the public’s perception
    of Applied may decline.

    Environmental Solutions segment are primarily manufactured in
    Alzenau, Germany; Cheseaux, Switzerland; Treviso, Italy; and
    Santa Clara, California.

In addition to the above properties, Applied leases office space
    for marketing, sales, engineering and customer support offices
    in 88 locations throughout the world: 23 in Europe, 20 in Japan,
    19 in North America (principally the United States), 17 in
    Asia-Pacific (including China and India), 7 in Korea and 2 in
    Taiwan.

In addition, Applied owns 112 acres of buildable land in
    Texas that could accommodate approximately 1,708,000 square
    feet of additional building space, 43 acres in California
    that could accommodate approximately 1,247,000 square feet
    of additional building space, and 6 acres in Colorado that
    could accommodate approximately 87,000 square feet of
    additional building space. Applied also leases: 13 acres in
    Taiwan that could accommodate approximately 270,000 square
    feet of additional building space; 5 acres in Singapore
    that could accommodate approximately 333,000 square feet of
    additional building space; 4 acres in Italy that could
    accommodate approximately 180,000 square feet of additional
    building space; 10 acres in Israel that could accommodate



approximately 111,000 square feet of additional building
    space; and 25 acres in China that could accommodate
    approximately 768,000 square feet of additional building
    space.

Applied considers the properties that it owns or leases as
    adequate to meet its current and future requirements. Applied
    regularly assesses the size, capability and location of its
    global infrastructure and periodically makes adjustments based
    on these assessments.

Dividends

During fiscal 2008, Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per
    share each quarter. The fourth quarterly cash dividend declared
    in fiscal 2008 was paid on December 4, 2008 to stockholders
    of record as of November 13, 2008. During fiscal 2007,
    Applied’s Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash
    dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share and three quarterly
    cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each
    quarter. Dividends paid during fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007
    totaled $325 million and $306 million, respectively.
    Applied currently anticipates that it will continue to pay cash
    dividends on a quarterly basis in the future, although the
    declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of
    the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s
    financial condition, results of operations, capital
    requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as
    a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of
    Applied’s stockholders.

Item 7:

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Introduction

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is
    intended to facilitate an understanding of Applied’s
    business and results of operations. This MD&A should be
    read in conjunction with Applied’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements and
    should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement
    set forth at the beginning of this

Form 10-K.

MD&A consists of the following sections:

•

Overview:

a summary of Applied’s business,
    measurements and opportunities.

•

Results of Operations:

a discussion of operating results.

•

Segment Information:

a discussion of segment operating
    results.

•

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources:

an
    analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual
    obligations and financial position.

Overview

Applied provides Nanomanufacturing
    Technology

tm

solutions for the global semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar and related industries, with a broad portfolio of
    innovative equipment, service and software products.
    Applied’s customers are primarily manufacturers of
    semiconductors, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar
    photovoltaic cells and modules (solar PVs), flexible electronics
    and energy-efficient glass. Applied operates in four reportable
    segments: Silicon, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy
    and Environmental Solutions. Product development and
    manufacturing activities occur primarily in North America,
    Europe, Israel and Asia. Applied’s broad range of equipment
    and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily
    through a direct sales force.

Applied’s results are driven primarily by worldwide demand
    for semiconductors, which in turn depends on end-user demand for
    electronic products. Each of Applied’s businesses is
    subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand for
    manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on
    supply and demand for chips, LCDs, solar PVs and other
    electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global
    economic and market conditions and technological advances in
    fabrication processes.

The following table presents certain significant measurements

Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected decreased demand for
    semiconductor equipment and, to a lesser extent, service
    products, due to unfavorable market conditions in the
    semiconductor industry, partially offset by increased demand for
    LCD and solar products. New orders decreased from fiscal 2007
    due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from memory,
    foundry and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by
    increased demand by LCD customers and, beginning in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2008, the recognition of orders for
    Applied’s
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line for manufacturing solar panels. Net sales
    decreased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to the
    decline in investment from memory and logic customers, partially
    offset by increased sales of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar
    manufacturing products. Net income decreased in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower net sales, offset in part
    by lower operating expenses. Fiscal 2008 financial results
    included charges associated with restructuring programs.



Fiscal 2007 financial results reflected improved conditions in
    the semiconductor industry that began with the industry’s
    recovery in 2006, while conditions in the display industry were
    mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite
    strong consumer demand for LCD TVs. Total orders decreased
    slightly from fiscal 2006, primarily due to the significant
    decline in demand for display manufacturing products, partially
    offset by increased demand for products and services in all
    other segments. Net sales increased during fiscal 2007 over
    fiscal 2006, primarily due to strong demand from dynamic random
    access memory (DRAM) and flash memory chip manufacturers,
    partially offset by a significant decline in LCD equipment sales
    as manufacturers absorbed capacity following substantial
    investment in 2006. Net income improved in fiscal 2007 compared
    to fiscal 2006 due to higher sales and lower operating expenses,
    offset in part by lower interest income. Fiscal 2007 financial
    results included restructuring and asset impairment and other
    charges associated with ceasing development of beamline implant
    products, and an in-process research and development
    (IPR&D) expense associated with the acquisition of certain
    net assets of Brooks Automation, Inc. (Brooks Software).

Fiscal 2006 results reflected a recovery in the semiconductor
    and flat panel display industries along with the global economy,
    as end-user demand for electronic products and LCDs drove
    increased customer investments in advanced silicon (particularly
    memory) and display products compared to fiscal 2005. During
    this period, Applied’s semiconductor customers increased
    both high-volume production and leading-edge 65nm and 45nm chip
    development. Improvements in operating performance were offset
    in part by restructuring and asset impairment charges, and an
    IPR&D expense associated with the acquisition of Applied
    Films Corporation (Applied Films).

Applied expects an unusually challenging environment for fiscal
    2009. The turmoil in the financial markets and weakening global
    economy are compounding the impact of the highly cyclical
    markets in which Applied operates. Current negative trends in
    consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty have led
    some customers to decrease factory operations and to reassess
    their projected spending plans. As a result, on
    November 12, 2008, Applied announced that it will implement
    a restructuring program beginning in the first quarter of fiscal
    2009. In addition, Applied’s ability to forecast
    customers’ future investments and its financial targets are
    limited in this uncertain macroeconomic climate. Applied
    currently expects that orders and revenue will be down overall
    and across most segments in fiscal 2009, with the exception of
    the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.

Applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry
    conditions in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. As a result of these
    conditions, there were significant fluctuations in
    Applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales, both within
    and across the fiscal years. Demand for manufacturing equipment
    has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in
    chip and LCD supply and demand and other factors, including
    global economic and market conditions and rapid technological
    advances in fabrication processes.

New orders for fiscal 2008 decreased 5 percent to
    $9.2 billion from $9.7 billion in the prior year, due
    to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from logic, memory,
    and foundry chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased
    demand for LCD and solar equipment, including the initial
    recognition of orders for the Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line. Demand for LCD equipment slowed substantially in
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as Display customers absorbed
    capacity following robust demand over the preceding three
    quarters.

New orders for fiscal 2007 decreased 2 percent to
    $9.7 billion from $9.9 billion in the prior year,
    reflecting delays in investment by LCD customers, partially
    offset by increased demand for solar equipment, semiconductor
    equipment, and service products. Demand for semiconductor
    equipment slowed in the second half of fiscal 2007 as customers
    absorbed added capacity, while demand from LCD customers
    recovered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.

Fiscal 2006 orders of $9.9 billion reflected increased
    semiconductor manufacturing equipment orders from memory
    manufacturers, increased service orders as a result of higher
    customer factory utilization and new product introductions, and
    increased display orders as customers invested in
    next-generation equipment.

Applied’s backlog for the last three fiscal years was as
    follows: $4.8 billion at October 26, 2008,
    $3.7 billion at October 28, 2007, and
    $3.4 billion at October 29, 2006. Backlog increased in
    fiscal 2008 primarily due to the inclusion of orders for
    products obtained through the acquisitions of Baccini S.p.A.
    (Baccini) and HCT Shaping Systems S.A. (HCT) that met
    Applied’s order recognition criteria during the third
    quarter of fiscal 2008 but did not qualify for order recognition
    at the time of the acquisition, partially offset by debookings,
    primarily of semiconductor equipment, and unfavorable currency
    adjustments. Backlog consists of: (1) orders for which
    written authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment
    dates are within the next 12 months, or shipment has
    occurred but revenue has not been recognized;
    (2) contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be
    earned within the next 12 months; and (3) orders for
    SunFab lines that are anticipated to be recognized as revenue
    within the next 12 months. Due to the potential for
    customer changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of
    orders, Applied’s backlog at any particular time is not
    necessarily indicative of actual sales for any future periods.

During fiscal 2008, net sales decreased by 16 percent, to
    $8.1 billion from $9.7 billion in fiscal 2007, due to
    decreased investment from memory and logic chip manufacturers,
    partially offset by increased demand from solar and LCD
    customers. During fiscal 2007, net sales increased by
    6 percent, to $9.7 billion from $9.2 billion in
    fiscal 2006, led by strength in memory capacity expansion
    throughout the year. In fiscal 2006, net sales of
    $9.2 billion followed the trend of increased orders for the
    year.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to
    42.4 percent in fiscal 2008 from 46.1 percent in
    fiscal 2007, compared to 46.8 percent in fiscal 2006.
    The decrease in the gross margin percentage from fiscal 2007 to
    fiscal 2008 was attributable to lower net sales and lower margin
    product mix. The decrease in the gross margin percentage from
    fiscal 2006 to fiscal 2007 was principally attributable to
    inventory-related charges of $56 million associated with
    ceasing development of beamline implant products, incremental
    charges attributable to acquisitions consisting of inventory
    fair value adjustments on products sold, amortization and
    product mix, partially offset by higher revenue levels and lower
    material costs. Gross margin during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006
    included $32 million, $27 million and
    $37 million, respectively, of equity-based compensation
    expense.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable
    extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the
    equipment and service products it provides. Applied believes
    that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments
    in RD&E to assure the availability of innovative technology
    that meets the current and projected requirements of its
    customers’ most advanced designs. Applied historically has
    maintained its commitment to investing in RD&E in order to
    continue to offer new products and technologies. RD&E
    expenses were $1.1 billion (14 percent of net sales)
    in fiscal 2008, $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales)
    in fiscal 2007 and $1.2 billion (13 percent of net
    sales) in fiscal 2006. RD&E expense during fiscal 2008,
    2007 and 2006 included $59 million, $56 million and
    $76 million, respectively, of equity-based compensation
    expense. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months
    depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an
    existing product, which typically has a shorter development
    cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer
    development cycle. Most of Applied’s existing products
    resulted from internal development activities and innovations
    involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain
    instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or
    new product areas, to complement its existing technology
    capabilities and to reduce time to market.

In fiscal 2008, Applied focused on the development of processes
    and systems for the continued scaling of semiconductor devices.
    Applied pioneered a self-aligned double patterning approach that
    can enable 22nm and below device fabrication using conventional
    optical lithography. The Company also developed technology for
    the



implementation of through-silicon vias, an emerging solution for
    interconnecting 3D chip stacks to achieve better device
    performance, lower power consumption, reduced costs and the
    integration of heterogeneous devices. Efforts were also focused
    on developing the systems and technology to reduce the

cost-per-watt

of solar electricity.

In fiscal 2007, Applied focused on developing systems for
    customers’ new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries,
    including systems to enable faster transistors using strain
    engineering and high-k/metal gate technologies, and patterning
    processes to enable customers to extend their existing 193 nm
    lithography tools through additional technology generations.
    Applied also continued to invest in solar research and
    development.

In fiscal 2006, Applied continued its development of systems to
    increase chip performance, especially for flash and DRAM
    devices. Applied also focused on developing systems for 32nm and
    22nm copper/low k interconnect processing technologies to
    address critical manufacturing challenges that chipmakers face
    as they transition to future device generations, helping them to
    bring new products to market more rapidly while minimizing risk.
    Applied also continued to focus on developing LCD systems to
    process larger glass substrates.

There were no IPR&D charges recorded in fiscal 2008. During
    fiscal 2007, Applied recorded an IPR&D expense of
    $5 million associated with the acquisition of certain net
    assets of Brooks Software, a division of Brooks Automation, Inc.
    During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded an IPR&D expense in
    the amount of $14 million related to the acquisition of
    Applied Films. Applied’s methodology for allocating the
    purchase price relating to purchased acquisitions to IPR&D
    was determined through established valuation techniques. The
    IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological
    feasibility had not been established and no future alternative
    uses existed.

Marketing,
    Selling, General and Administrative

Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $965 million (12 percent of net sales) in
    fiscal 2008, $952 million (10 percent of net
    sales) in fiscal 2007, and $907 million (10 percent of
    net sales) in fiscal 2006. The increase in marketing, selling,
    general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2007 to 2008 was
    principally attributable to increased operating costs from
    business acquisitions and equity compensation expenses, offset
    in part by cost control initiatives. The increase in marketing,
    selling, general and administrative expenses from fiscal 2006 to
    2007 was principally attributable to increased operating costs
    from acquired businesses, investments in the solar business
    expansion, and increased variable compensation expenses. These
    expenses were partially offset by lower equity compensation
    expenses and savings from cost control initiatives, including
    ceasing development of beamline implant products and
    transitioning to managed service providers to perform certain
    information technology and business infrastructure support.
    Marketing, selling and general and administrative expenses
    during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 included $88 million,
    $77 million and $104 million, respectively, of
    equity-based compensation expense.

Restructuring
    and Asset Impairments

During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied announced a
    global cost reduction plan (the Plan) that primarily affected
    its Silicon and Applied Global Services segments and related
    support organizations. As part of the Plan, Applied reduced its
    global workforce through a combination of job elimination and
    attrition. For fiscal 2008, Applied recorded restructuring
    charges of $29 million relating to the Plan, consisting
    primarily of employee termination costs to reduce its workforce.
    The affected employees were based in North America, Europe and
    Asia, and represented multiple functions.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, Applied’s Board
    of Directors approved a plan (the Implant Plan) to cease
    development of beamline implant products for semiconductor
    manufacturing and curtail the operations of its Implant group
    based in Horsham, England. Under the Implant Plan, Applied
    closed its research, development and manufacturing operations in
    Horsham in October 2007. Costs under the Implant Plan for fiscal
    2008 consisted of restructuring charges of $11 million
    associated with facilities. Costs under the Implant Plan in
    fiscal 2007 consisted primarily of inventory-related charges
    reported as cost of products sold of $56 million, other
    operating expenses of $10 million, and restructuring and
    asset impairment charges of $30 million. Also as part of
    the Implant Plan, Applied recorded restructuring charges of
    $22 million, consisting primarily of employee termination
    costs to reduce its workforce. The majority of the affected
    employees were based in Horsham, England, and represented
    multiple functions. Asset impairment charges included
    $8 million of fixed asset write-offs. The Implant group
    operated in



the Silicon segment, and the results of its operations were not
    material to Applied’s financial position or results of
    operations.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied’s Board of
    Directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of
    Applied’s real estate and facilities portfolio (the
    Disinvestment Plan). Properties with an estimated fair value of
    $56 million were reported as assets held-for-sale and
    reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded
    an asset impairment charge of $124 million to write down
    the following properties to estimated fair value:
    (1) facilities in Narita, Japan, Chunan, Korea, Hillsboro,
    Oregon, and Danvers, Massachusetts; and (2) 26 acres
    of unimproved land in Hillsboro, Oregon. During fiscal 2006,
    Applied sold the Danvers facility for net proceeds of
    $16 million and recognized a gain of $4 million.
    During fiscal 2007, Applied sold the Hillsboro, Chunan, and
    Narita facilities and the Hillsboro land for total net proceeds
    of $38 million and recognized a gain of $3 million.
    Also in fiscal 2006, as part of the Disinvestment Plan, Applied
    recorded lease termination charges in the amount of
    $89 million related to the closure of its leased Hayward,
    California facility.

For further details, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Net
    Interest and Other Income

Net interest and other income was $89 million for fiscal
    2008, $98 million for fiscal 2007, and $149 million
    for fiscal 2006.

The decrease in net interest and other income for fiscal 2008
    from fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in short-term
    investments and a decrease in interest rates during fiscal 2008,
    offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with
    scheduled debt maturities that occurred in September 2007. The
    decrease in net interest and other income from fiscal 2006 to
    2007 was primarily due to a reduction in cash and investments
    during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 when Applied
    repurchased 145 million shares of its outstanding common
    stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion under
    an accelerated stock buyback program.

Income
    Taxes

Applied’s effective income tax provision rate was
    31.8 percent for fiscal 2008, 29.9 percent for fiscal
    2007, and 30.0 percent for fiscal 2006. Applied’s
    effective tax rate was higher for fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal
    2007 as fiscal 2007 reflected benefits of $36 million
    principally related to the favorable resolution of audits of
    prior years’ income tax filings, partially offset by a
    $13 million charge from the expensing of equity-based
    compensation. Applied’s effective tax rate of
    30.0 percent for fiscal 2006 reflected benefits of
    $61 million principally related to the favorable resolution
    of audits of prior years’ income tax filings, partially
    offset by a $17 million charge from the expensing of
    equity-based compensation.

Applied’s future effective income tax rate depends on
    various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic
    composition of Applied’s pre-tax income, and non-tax
    deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions.
    Management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts
    the effective income tax rate accordingly.

Segment
    Information

Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon, Applied
    Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental
    Solutions. A description of the products and services, as well
    as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in
    Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain
    operating expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate
    level. These unallocated costs include those for equity-based
    compensation and certain components of variable compensation,
    corporate marketing and sales, corporate functions (certain
    management, finance, legal, human resources and RD&E), and
    unabsorbed information technology and occupancy. Effective in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied renamed two of its
    reportable segments. The Fab Solutions segment was renamed
    Applied Global Services, and the Adjacent Technologies segment
    was renamed Energy and Environmental Solutions. In addition,
    Applied changed its management reporting system for services to
    report all service results in the Applied Global Services



segment. Applied has reclassified segment operating results for
    fiscal 2007 and 2006 to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation.

Discussions below include the results of each reportable segment.

Silicon
    Segment

The Silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for
    deposition, etch, rapid thermal processing (RTP), chemical
    mechanical planarization (CMP), and metrology and inspection.
    Development efforts are focused on solving customers’ key
    technical challenges, including transistor performance and
    nanoscale patterning, and on improving chip manufacturing
    productivity to reduce costs.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years
    were as follows:

Silicon new orders decreased 38 percent to
    $4.1 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The
    decrease in new orders was due to reduced demand for equipment
    from logic, memory and foundry customers. Net sales decreased
    38 percent to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to
    fiscal 2007. The decrease in net sales was due to decreased
    investment by logic and memory customers. Operating income
    decreased 48 percent to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating income was
    due to significantly lower revenue levels from the slowdown in
    the semiconductor equipment industry, partially offset by lower
    operating expenses attributable to continued focus on cost
    controls and improvement in manufacturing activities. In fiscal
    2008, the Company launched two key products for photomask
    applications: the Applied Aera2 Mask Inspection system, which
    detects critical defects on a photomask, and the Applied Tetra
    Reticle Clean system, which cleans 32nm and below photomasks
    using wet clean chemistry. The Company also introduced the
    Applied Producer eHARP system for depositing films in high
    aspect ratio device structures.

Silicon orders increased 1 percent to $6.7 billion in
    fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, reflecting the
    semiconductor industry’s strength during this period,
    driven by demand for cell phones, computers, digital TVs, game
    consoles, MP3 players and other electronic products. The
    majority of new orders were for memory applications as customers
    invested in leading-edge flash and DRAM memory devices, while
    orders from foundries remained at low levels. Net sales
    increased 9 percent to $6.5 billion in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in net sales was due to
    increased investment by memory and logic semiconductor customers
    in multiple areas, including etch, inspection, and RTP products.
    Operating income increased 19 percent to $2.4 billion
    in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in
    operating income was due to higher revenue levels and continued
    focus on cost controls. Operating income for fiscal 2007
    included charges of $66 million related to ceasing
    development of beamline implant products. In fiscal 2007, the
    Company launched the Applied Producer GT, a significant redesign
    of its successful Producer platform that offers faster, more
    cost-effective CVD processing for 45 nm and beyond
    applications. To meet the challenges of fabricating
    next-generation transistors, Applied announced its portfolio of
    high-k/metal gate solutions, including the Applied Advanced Gate
    Stack and Applied Centura Carina Etch systems. Other new etch
    systems introduced were the Applied Mariana Trench, for etching
    high aspect ratio structures, the Applied Opus AdvantEdge Metal
    Etch with a new 5-chamber platform, and the Applied Centura
    Tetra III Advanced Reticle Etch. The Company also added to
    its line of lithography-enabling systems with the new Applied
    Producer ACE SACVD and added to its line of strain engineering
    solutions with the Applied Producer Celera CVD.

During fiscal 2006, leading semiconductor manufacturers reported
    increased sales as the electronics market continued to grow. The
    demand for consumer electronics, including broadband, personal
    computers and cell phones with increasing digital content and
    complex chips, resulted in increased chip demand and the need
    for additional capacity. In addition to expanding consumer
    electronics demand, corporate information technology investment
    increased, with an emphasis on security, server consolidation
    and more robust internet infrastructures. During



fiscal 2006, demand increased in many areas, including
    etch, inspection and thin films products. Improved operating
    results in fiscal 2006 reflected an increase in business volume,
    offset in part by increases in variable compensation expenses.
    Applied continued its development of systems to increase chip
    performance, especially for flash and DRAM devices. To extend
    the usefulness of aluminum (the material used by many memory
    manufacturers for interconnects) to the sub-70nm node, the
    Company introduced two products, the Applied Endura CVD Al
    technology and Applied Centura AdvantEdge Metal Etch system. For
    faster copper interconnects, Applied launched its enhanced
    Endura CuBS/S II system with Aktiv Preclean, extending the
    system’s capability to the 45nm node and below, especially
    for use with ultra-low dielectric constant (low k) films.
    The Company introduced the Applied Endura iLB II (integrated
    liner-barrier) system, offering advances in PVD titanium and
    preclean technologies, to provide significantly reduced
    resistance for contact structures. The Company also focused on
    providing solutions to extend customers’ lithography
    technology, introducing the Applied Producer APF-e (advanced
    patterning film enhancement) system. The new APF-e film enables
    chipmakers to cost-effectively pattern nano-scale features
    without additional integration complexity while reducing their
    reliance on next-generation lithography systems.

Applied currently expects that the uncertain economic
    conditions, including credit concerns and lower consumer
    spending, will lead to further decline in demand for
    semiconductor equipment in fiscal 2009.

Applied
    Global Services Segment

The Applied Global Services segment encompasses technically
    differentiated products, including spares, services, certain
    earlier generation equipment products, and remanufactured
    equipment, to improve operating efficiency, reduce operating
    costs, and lessen the environmental impact of semiconductor,
    display and solar customers’ factories. Customer demand for
    products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution
    system with trained service engineers located in close proximity
    to customer sites.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years

Fiscal 2008 results were impacted by lower levels of
    semiconductor and display customers’ factory utilization.
    New orders decreased 10 percent to $2.2 billion in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to lower orders for
    spares, fab-wide services, and refurbished equipment, partially
    offset by increased orders for service and system enhancements.
    Net sales decreased 1 percent to $2.3 billion in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The net sales decrease
    reflected lower sales of fab-wide services and spares, offset by
    increased sales in services and system enhancements. Operating
    income decreased 9 percent to $575 million in fiscal
    2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to higher operating expenses in
    fiscal 2008.

New orders increased 4 percent to $2.5 billion in
    fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. The increase in new orders
    reflected increased demand for spare parts and services, as well
    as demand for factory automation products obtained as part of
    the Brooks Software acquisition. Net sales of $2.4 billion
    in fiscal 2007 were slightly up compared to fiscal 2006 due to
    increased factory automation sales offset by declines in spares
    sales. Fiscal 2007 remanufactured equipment orders and net sales
    remained consistent with fiscal 2006 levels. Operating income
    decreased 8 percent to $630 million in fiscal 2007
    compared to fiscal 2006, reflecting product mix and increased
    operating expenses and charges related to the Brooks Software
    acquisition.

Net sales in 2006 reflected increases in spare parts shipments
    and service contracts as a result of higher wafer starts and an
    increase in 200mm remanufactured equipment investment. During
    fiscal 2006, operating results reflected improved operational
    efficiencies and savings from cost control initiatives. Applied
    also expanded its product offerings with the introduction of
    abatement systems for reducing perfluorocarbon (PFC) emissions
    and additional chamber performance services capabilities.



Fiscal 2007 and 2006 new orders, net sales and operating income
    increased from the previously reported amounts due to the
    reclassification in fiscal 2008 of display service products from
    the Display segment.

Applied currently expects that the uncertain global economic
    conditions will lead to lower factory utilization by
    Applied’s customers, resulting in lower demand for Applied
    Global Services’ products in fiscal 2009.

Display
    Segment

The Display segment encompasses products for manufacturing LCDs
    for TVs, personal computers and other video-enabled devices. The
    business is focused on expanding market share by differentiation
    with larger-scale substrates, entry into new markets, and
    development of products to enable cost reductions through
    productivity and uniformity.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years
    were as follows:

New orders increased significantly to $1.5 billion in
    fiscal 2008 compared to $273 million in fiscal 2007.
    Increased orders were due to substantial increases in demand by
    Display customers in response to strong end-product demand. This
    demand for LCD equipment reached an inflexion point in the third
    quarter of fiscal 2008 and decreased significantly in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2008, reflecting the volatility of the display
    industry. Net sales increased 38 percent to
    $976 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007,
    primarily due to customers’ investment in Gen-8 products.
    Operating income increased to $310 million in fiscal 2008
    from $159 million in fiscal 2007. Operating income
    increased due to higher revenue levels, product mix and lower
    operating costs. In fiscal 2008, the Company introduced its
    Gen-10 systems that can process substrates sized at
    approximately 2.85 x 3.05 meters. These systems include the
    AKT-90K PECVD and AKT-90K EBT products.

New orders decreased 69 percent to $273 million in
    fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, reflecting delays in
    capacity expansion plans by LCD panel makers in light of excess
    inventories and end product sales price declines. Display
    customers increased spending levels in the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2007 as panel makers began to experience more favorable
    market conditions. Net sales decreased 14 percent to
    $705 million in fiscal 2007. The decrease in net sales was
    attributable to lower investment by LCD manufacturers as they
    absorbed capacity. Operating income decreased 38 percent to
    $159 million in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, due to
    lower revenues and factory absorption, product mix and higher
    operating expenses in support of the expanded product portfolio
    resulting from the acquisition of Applied Films in July 2006. In
    2007, Applied launched the
    AKT-PiVot

tm

55KV system, which employs high-productivity, cost-efficient PVD
    technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide
    films on the substrate.

During fiscal 2006, price reductions in consumer electronics
    accelerated the growth of the flat panel display market. As a
    result, display manufacturers increased investments in Gen-7,
    Gen-7.5, and Gen-8 systems. In addition, laptop demand continued
    to be strong, resulting in additional Gen-5 and Gen-5.5 fab
    investment. With the acquisition of Applied Films in fiscal
    2006, Applied entered the PVD color filter market. During the
    last quarter of fiscal 2006, flat panel equipment demand began
    to slow as customers aligned their capacity plans and inventory
    levels. Fiscal 2006 results included a $5 million
    IPR&D expense related to the acquisition of Applied Films.
    Applied launched three FPD systems, the AKT-55K EBT, the AKT-55K
    PECVD and the AKT-NEW ARISTO 2200, for manufacturing Gen-8.5
    panels, sized at 2.2m x 2.5m, which produce up to six

55-inch

LCD
    TV screens.

Fiscal 2007 and 2006 new orders, net sales and operating income
    reported herein are lower than the previously reported amounts
    due to the reclassification in fiscal 2008 of display service
    products from the Display segment to the Applied Global Services
    segment.



Applied currently expects that the uncertain global economic
    conditions will result in decreasing consumer spending, leading
    to lower factory utilization by flat panel display manufacturers
    and lower demand for LCD equipment in fiscal 2009.

Energy
    and Environmental Solutions Segment

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products
    for fabricating solar PV cells and modules, high throughput
    roll-to-roll coating systems for flexible electronics and web
    products, and systems used in the manufacture of
    energy-efficient glass. Applied began offering these products
    after the acquisition of Applied Films in fiscal 2006. This
    segment also includes products for manufacturing c-Si solar PVs
    that were obtained through the acquisitions of HCT in fiscal
    2007 and Baccini in fiscal 2008. This business is focused on
    delivering solutions to generate and conserve energy, with an
    emphasis on lowering the cost to produce solar power by
    providing equipment to enhance manufacturing scale and
    efficiency.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years
    were as follows:

$


$


$


New orders of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008 increased from
    $245 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in new orders was
    primarily due to the recognition of orders for the Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line that began in the first quarter of fiscal
    2008, as well as growth in orders for c-Si products. Net sales
    of $819 million in fiscal 2008 increased from
    $165 million in fiscal 2007 due to customers’
    investment in c-Si products from the acquisitions of HCT and
    Baccini and increased sales across all other products in the
    segment. The increase in net sales for fiscal 2008 included the
    first revenue recognition of an Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line. The operating loss of $183 million in
    fiscal 2008 increased from $89 million in fiscal 2007. The
    increase in operating loss reflected increased RD&E
    spending to develop products that enable lower-cost production
    of solar energy, increased operating costs, amortization of
    acquisition-related costs, and costs related to expansion of
    solar marketing efforts, partially offset by higher revenues.

New orders of $245 million in fiscal 2007 increased from
    $37 million in fiscal 2006, due primarily to increased
    orders of c-Si solar, glass and flexible electronics products.
    Net sales of $165 million in fiscal 2007 increased from
    $20 million in fiscal 2006 due primarily to higher glass,
    flexible electronics and c-Si solar net sales. Operating loss of
    $89 million in fiscal 2007 increased from $8 million
    in fiscal 2006, reflecting increased RD&E spending to
    develop products and services that enable lower-cost production
    of solar energy and costs related to expansion of solar
    marketing efforts, offset by higher revenues. In fiscal 2007,
    Applied introduced the Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line, the first integrated production line designed
    for manufacturing thin film silicon solar modules using
    5.7 square meter glass panels.

Orders and net sales in fiscal 2006 reflected the results of
    Applied Films’ solar, flexible electronics and
    energy-efficient glass products that Applied acquired in the
    third quarter. Fiscal 2006 results included a $9 million
    IPR&D expense related to the acquisition of Applied Films.

Business
    Combinations and Equity-Method Investment

On January 31, 2008, Applied acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately-held company based in
    Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of
    cash and marketable securities acquired. The acquired business
    is a leading supplier of automated metallization and test
    systems for manufacturing c-Si photovoltaic cells.

On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum,
    Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts
    cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million.



On August 23, 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding
    shares of Switzerland-based HCT for $463 million in cash,
    net of cash acquired. The acquired business is the world’s
    leading supplier of precision wafering systems used principally
    in manufacturing c-Si substrates for the solar industry.

On March 30, 2007, Applied purchased Brooks Software for
    $137 million in cash. The acquired business is a leading
    provider of factory management and control software to the
    semiconductor and flat panel display industries. Its products
    complement Applied’s existing software applications and
    enable Applied to offer customers a comprehensive computer
    integrated manufacturing solution for optimizing fab operations.

On August 14, 2006, Applied’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Metron Technology, Inc. (Metron), purchased certain parts
    cleaning and recycling assets in Singapore from UMS Solutions
    PTE Ltd. for $10 million. The acquisition enhanced the
    Company’s capabilities in Southeast Asia to provide
    advanced, high-quality parts cleaning services to support its
    customers’ semiconductor manufacturing requirements.

On July 20, 2006, Applied and Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co.,
    Ltd. (Screen) completed the formation of Sokudo Co., Ltd.
    (Sokudo), a Japanese joint venture company, to deliver advanced
    track solutions for customers’ critical semiconductor
    manufacturing requirements. Track systems are a key part of
    semiconductor manufacturing and are used before and after
    photolithography to deposit, bake and develop the photoresist
    layer that defines circuit patterns. Screen owns 52 percent
    and holds the controlling interest in Sokudo, and Applied owns
    48 percent of Sokudo. Screen transferred into Sokudo its
    existing track business and related intellectual property,
    including employees, products and its installed base of systems.
    Applied paid $147 million for its investment in Sokudo.
    Additionally, Applied contributed to Sokudo certain technology
    and related intellectual property and has provided key
    development employees. Screen performs manufacturing for Sokudo
    under an outsourcing agreement.

On July 7, 2006, Applied completed its acquisition of
    Applied Films, a leading supplier of thin film deposition
    equipment used in manufacturing LCDs, solar cells, flexible
    electronics and energy-efficient glass. Applied paid $28.50 per
    share in cash for each outstanding share of Applied Films for a
    total purchase price of approximately $484 million, or
    $328 million net of Applied Films’ existing cash and
    marketable securities. As part of the acquisition, Applied
    assumed Applied Films’ outstanding stock options and
    restricted stock unit awards that, at the acquisition date, had
    a total fair value of $26 million, of which
    $18 million was allocated to the purchase price and the
    remainder to unearned compensation. Upon the acquisition and
    subject to vesting, Applied Films stock options became
    exercisable for shares of Applied common stock and Applied Films
    restricted stock unit awards became payable in shares of Applied
    common stock totaling, in the aggregate, three million shares of
    Applied common stock.

On December 23, 2005, Applied acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of ChemTrace Corporation and ChemTrace
    Precision Cleaning, Inc. for $22 million in cash, net of
    cash acquired, of which $18 million was paid upon closing.
    This business provides customers with precision parts cleaning
    and materials testing solutions.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)

No. 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets”

(FSP 142-3).

FSP 142-3

amends the factors an entity should consider in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful
    life of recognized intangible assets under FASB Statement
    No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”
    This new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets
    that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets
    in business combinations and asset acquisitions.

FSP 142-3

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008.
    Early adoption is prohibited. Applied is evaluating the
    potential impact of the implementation of

FSP 142-3

on its financial position and results of operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires disclosures of how and
    why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
    entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash
    flows. SFAS 161 will be effective for Applied in fiscal
    2010, with early adoption permitted. Applied is



evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of
    SFAS 161 on its financial position and results of
    operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141
    (revised), “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141(R)).
    The standard changes the accounting for business combinations,
    including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in
    consideration for a business combination, the recognition of
    contingent consideration, the accounting for preacquisition gain
    and loss contingencies, the recognition of capitalized
    in-process research and development, the accounting for
    acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment
    of acquisition related transaction costs, and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    SFAS 141(R) will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010,
    with early adoption prohibited. Applied is evaluating the
    potential impact of the implementation of SFAS 141(R) on
    its financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (SFAS 160). The standard changes the accounting for
    noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial
    statements, including the requirements to classify
    noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated
    stockholders’ equity, and the elimination of “minority
    interest” accounting in results of operations with earnings
    attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of
    consolidated earnings. Additionally, SFAS 160 revises the
    accounting for both increases and decreases in a parent’s
    controlling ownership interest. SFAS 160 will be effective
    for Applied in fiscal 2010, with early adoption prohibited.
    Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation
    of SFAS 160 on its financial position and results of
    operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS 159), which permits entities to
    elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other
    items at fair value that are not currently required to be
    measured at fair value. This election is irrevocable.
    SFAS 159 will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2009.
    Management does not believe the effect of implementing
    SFAS 159 will have a material impact on the Company’s
    financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 157-1,

“Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB
    Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That
    Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease
    Classification or Measurement under Statement 13”

(FSP 157-1)

and

FSP 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

(FSP 157-2).

FSP 157-1

amends SFAS 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from
    its scope.

FSP 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non-financial
    assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the
    beginning of Applied’s first quarter of fiscal 2010. The
    measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial
    assets and financial liabilities are effective for Applied
    beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In October 2008,
    the FASB issued

FSP 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active”

(FSP 157-3).

FSP 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is
    not active, and provides guidance on the key considerations in
    determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market
    for that financial asset is not active. Applied will continue to
    evaluate the application of SFAS 157. Management does not
    believe the effect of implementing SFAS 157 will have a
    material impact on the Company’s financial position or
    results of operations.

Financial
    Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Applied’s cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased
    to $3.5 billion at October 26, 2008 from
    $3.7 billion at October 28, 2007, due primarily to
    share repurchases and cash dividend distributions, offset by
    cash generated from operating activities. Applied has not
    undertaken any significant external financing activities for
    several years.



Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:

Applied generated cash from operating activities of
    $1.7 billion in fiscal 2008, $2.2 billion in fiscal
    2007, and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2006. The primary sources
    of cash from operating activities were net income, as adjusted
    to exclude the effect of non-cash charges including
    depreciation, amortization, equity-based compensation, asset
    impairments and restructuring and IPR&D expenses, and
    changes in working capital levels, including accounts receivable
    and inventories. Applied utilized programs to discount letters
    of credit issued by customers of $167 million in fiscal
    2008, $431 million in fiscal 2007, and $237 million in
    fiscal 2006. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many
    factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to
    discount the letters of credit and the cost of such
    arrangements. In fiscal 2008, Applied factored accounts
    receivables totaling $125 million. Days sales outstanding
    were 79 days at the end of fiscal 2008 and 2007, and
    80 days at the end of fiscal 2006. Inventories increased by
    $674 million in fiscal 2008, mainly due to a net inventory
    increase within the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.

Applied used $76 million and $977 million of cash in
    investing activities in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively, and
    generated $1.9 billion of cash from investing activities in
    fiscal 2006. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments,
    net of purchases of investments, totaled $405 million in
    fiscal 2008. Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from
    sales and maturities of investments, totaled $150 million
    in fiscal 2007. Proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled
    $2.6 billion in fiscal 2006. Proceeds from the sale of
    investments in fiscal 2006 were used principally to
    fund Applied’s accelerated stock buyback initiated
    during that year.

Capital expenditures were $288 million in fiscal 2008,
    $265 million in fiscal 2007, and $179 million in
    fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2008 capital expenditures included
    investment in the implementation of a global business software
    system. Fiscal 2007 capital expenditures included investment in
    the implementation of an enterprise resource planning software
    system, and in Applied’s new global development capability
    center in Xi’an, China. Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures
    included purchases of lab equipment, network infrastructure and
    three buildings in Santa Clara, California that Applied had
    previously leased.

Investing activities also included investments in technology and
    acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market
    opportunities or emerging technologies. During fiscal 2008,
    Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of Baccini, a
    privately-held company based in Italy, for a purchase price of
    $215 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities
    acquired. During the year Applied also purchased from Edwards
    Vacuum, Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor
    equipment parts cleaning and refurbishment business for
    $19 million. During fiscal 2007, Applied acquired all of
    the outstanding shares of HCT for $463 million in cash, net
    of cash acquired, and certain net assets of Brooks Automation,
    Inc. consisting of its Brooks Software division for
    $137 million in cash. During fiscal 2006, Applied paid cash
    for acquisitions and the investment in a joint venture totaling
    $486 million. During fiscal 2006, Applied acquired the
    outstanding stock of Applied Films for $310 million in
    cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired, and
    assumed equity awards with a fair value of $26 million, of
    which $18 million was included in the purchase price;
    formed a joint venture, Sokudo, with Dainippon Screen Mfg.
    Ltd., for which Applied paid $147 million in cash and
    contributed other assets; acquired certain assets of UMS
    Solutions for $10 million; and acquired ChemTrace
    Corporation and ChemTrace Precision Cleaning, Inc. for
    approximately $22 million in cash, net of cash acquired, of
    which $18 million was paid upon closing. See Note 12
    of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    details.

Applied used cash of $1.4 billion for financing activities
    in fiscal 2008, $892 million in fiscal 2007, and
    $4.1 billion in fiscal 2006. Financing activities included
    issuances and repurchases of common stock and payment



of dividends. Since March 1996, Applied has systematically
    repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market. Cash
    used to repurchase shares totaled $1.5 billion in fiscal
    2008, $1.3 billion in fiscal 2007, and $4.2 billion in
    fiscal 2006. During fiscal 2008, Applied’s Board of
    Directors declared four quarterly cash dividends in the amount
    of $0.06 per share each. The fourth quarterly cash dividend
    declared in fiscal 2008 was paid on December 4, 2008, to
    stockholders of record as of November 13, 2008. During
    fiscal 2007, Applied’s Board of Directors declared one
    quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share and
    three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share
    each. During fiscal 2006, Applied’s Board of Directors
    declared one quarterly cash dividend in the amount of $0.03 per
    share and three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.05
    per share each. Dividends paid during fiscal 2008, 2007 and
    fiscal 2006 were $325 million, $306 million and
    $251 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates
    that it will continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis
    in the future, although the declaration of any future cash
    dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will
    depend on Applied’s financial condition, results of
    operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other
    factors, as well as a determination that cash dividends are in
    the best interest of Applied’s stockholders. Financing
    activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt.
    Applied did not have any borrowings in fiscal years 2008, 2007
    or 2006. As of October 26, 2008, Applied had credit
    facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up
    to approximately $1.2 billion, of which $1.0 billion
    is comprised of a

5-year

revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is
    scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for
    borrowings at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates
    selected by Applied for each advance, and includes financial and
    other covenants with which Applied was in compliance at
    October 26, 2008. No amounts were outstanding under this
    agreement at October 26, 2008. Cash used for debt
    repayments totaled $2 million for fiscal 2008,
    $202 million for fiscal 2007, and $8 million for
    fiscal 2006. Cash generated from issuances of common stock
    pursuant to Applied’s equity compensation programs totaled
    $401 million for fiscal 2008, $948 million for fiscal
    2007, and $361 million for fiscal 2006.

On September 18, 2006, Applied entered into accelerated
    stock buyback agreements with Goldman Sachs under which Applied
    agreed to repurchase from Goldman Sachs shares of Applied’s
    outstanding common stock for an initial purchase price of
    $2.5 billion. Under the agreements, Applied purchased
    145 million shares of its common stock on
    September 18, 2006 at a price per share of $17.20, and
    Goldman Sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of shares
    in the open market over the following four months. At the end of
    the four month period, Applied was entitled or subject to a
    price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of
    Applied common stock during the purchase period. On
    January 24, 2007, Applied settled the price adjustment of
    $132 million by payment in cash to Goldman Sachs, resulting
    in an adjusted price per share of $18.08. The repurchase was
    funded with Applied’s existing cash and investments. The
    repurchased shares were reported as treasury stock.

In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 26, 2008, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee arrangements was
    $167 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in
    connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that
    required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction
    being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical
    experience and information currently available, that it is
    probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under
    these guarantee arrangements.

Applied expects that changes in its business will affect its
    working capital components, primarily related to its Energy and
    Environmental Solutions segment, which includes products for
    manufacturing solar PVs. Applied believes that the solar
    industry is moving to increasingly greater factory output of
    solar modules, including projects with an output capable of
    generating electricity on a gigawatt scale. Applied has entered
    into contracts with multiple customers for its
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line, for projects of varying scale. Fulfillment of
    these contracts requires Applied to invest in inventory
    particularly work in process, and Applied may obtain customer
    deposits that reduce the associated effect on other working
    capital components.

Applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of
    investment grade municipal bonds, money market mutual funds,
    U.S. Treasury and agency securities, corporate bonds,
    equity securities, and mortgage-backed and asset-backed
    securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its
    investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may
    include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks
    prudently in accordance with its investment policies. In fiscal
    2008, as part of its regular investment review process, Applied
    recorded an insignificant impairment charge



associated with its investment portfolio. At October 26,
    2008, Applied had a gross unrealized loss of $48 million
    due to a decrease in the fair market value of certain fixed-rate
    debt and equity securities as a result of the recent turmoil in
    the global financial markets. Applied regularly reviews its
    investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that
    have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in
    determining whether a loss is temporary include: the length of
    time and extent to which fair market value has been lower than
    the cost basis; the financial condition, credit quality and
    near-term prospects of the investee; and Applied’s ability
    to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow
    for any anticipated recovery in fair market value. Generally,
    the contractual terms of the investments do not permit
    settlement at prices less than the amortized cost of the
    investments. While Applied cannot predict future market
    conditions or market liquidity, Applied believes that its
    investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the
    risks in its investment portfolio. The following types of
    financial instruments may present additional risks arising from
    liquidity

and/or

credit concerns: structured investment vehicles, auction rate
    securities, sub-prime and “Alt-A” mortgage-backed
    securities, and collateralized debt obligations. At
    October 26, 2008, Applied’s holdings in these
    categories of investments totaled $30 million, or 1% of
    total cash, cash equivalents and investments, which Applied does
    not consider to be material. In the event that these categories
    of investments become illiquid, Applied does not believe that
    this will materially affect the Company’s liquidity or
    results of operations.

Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing
    and extent of factors such as those discussed above,
    Applied’s management believes that cash generated from
    operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing
    cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to
    satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next
    12 months. In November 2008, Applied announced that it had
    temporarily suspended stock repurchases in order to maintain
    financial flexibility in light of the deteriorating global
    economic and market conditions. For further details regarding
    Applied’s operating, investing and financing activities for
    each of the three years in the period ended October 26,
    2008, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this
    report.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 26, 2008, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee agreements was
    approximately $167 million. Applied has not recorded any
    liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements below
    that required Applied to appropriately account for the
    underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not
    believe, based on historical experience and information
    currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will
    be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total
    rental expense for operating leases was $68 million for
    fiscal 2008, $62 million for fiscal 2007, and
    $70 million for fiscal 2006.

    purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual
    requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied
    does not take delivery of the contracted goods.



In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, the
    Company has certain tax obligations. During the first quarter of
    fiscal 2008, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB
    Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes” (FIN 48). The Company historically has
    classified interest and penalties and unrecognized tax benefits
    as current liabilities. Upon adoption of FIN 48, the
    Company reclassified gross interest and penalties and
    unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to result in
    payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current
    liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of
    October 26, 2008, the Company recorded gross unrecognized
    tax benefits of $63 million and gross interest and
    penalties of $8 million. Of the $8 million in interest
    and penalties, $5 million is classified as long-term
    payable and $3 million is classified as current payable on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At this time, the Company is
    unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of
    payments in individual years due to uncertainties in the timing
    of tax audit outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not
    included in the above contractual obligation table.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related
    disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
    amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in
    the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
    Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered
    to be critical accounting policies.

A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both
    material to the presentation of Applied’s consolidated
    financial statements and requires management to make difficult,
    subjective or complex judgments that could have a material
    effect on Applied’s financial condition or results of
    operations. Specifically, these policies have the following
    attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions
    about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the
    estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could
    reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are
    reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on
    Applied’s financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects
    cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates
    on historical experience and on various other assumptions
    believed to be applicable and reasonable under the
    circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur,
    as additional information is obtained and as Applied’s
    operating environment changes. These changes have historically
    been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management
    is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which
    are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged
    periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the
    section above entitled “Risk Factors.” Based on a
    critical assessment of its accounting policies and the
    underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application
    of those policies, management believes that Applied’s
    consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation
    of Applied’s financial condition and results of operations.

Management believes that the following are critical accounting
    policies:

Warranty
    Costs

Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue
    is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by
    analyzing specific product and historical configuration
    statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied’s
    warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure
    rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting
    product failures during the warranty period. As Applied’s
    customer engineers and process support engineers are highly
    trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a
    significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and
    availability of critical replacement parts is another
    significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen
    component failures or exceptional component performance can also
    result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs
    differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to
    the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could
    have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.



Inventory
    Valuation

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market,
    with cost determined on a

first-in,

first-out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for
    estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and
    the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
    demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for
    potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing
    historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are
    evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known
    and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If
    actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated,
    additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete
    inventory might be required, which could have a material adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also
    reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually
    for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology,
    are generally recorded in connection with a business
    acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually
    based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the
    success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If
    actual product acceptance differs significantly from the
    estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment
    charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. The fair
    value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market
    multiples approach, and is dependent on market values for
    companies in a similar industry. A severe decline in market
    value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for
    impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Income
    Taxes

Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax
    assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect
    of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of
    recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a
    valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion
    of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has
    determined that it is more likely than not that its future
    taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax
    assets.

The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
    composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing
    each region, non-tax deductible expenses incurred in connection
    with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management
    carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the
    effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ
    from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a
    valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its
    effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment
    in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of
    complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
    inconsistent with Applied’s expectations could have a
    material impact on Applied’s results of operations and
    financial condition.

Equity-Based
    Compensation — Employee Stock Option Plans and
    Employee Stock Purchase Plans

Effective on October 31, 2005, Applied began accounting for
    stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) shares
    under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123(R),

“Share-Based
    Payment”

(SFAS 123(R)), which requires recognition
    of the fair value of equity-based compensation. The fair value
    of stock options and ESPP shares is estimated using a
    Black-Scholes option valuation model. This methodology requires
    the use of subjective assumptions including expected stock price
    volatility and the estimated life of each award. The fair value
    of equity-based compensation awards less the estimated
    forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award,
    and Applied has elected to use the straight-line method. The
    fair value of restricted stock units is calculated based upon
    the fair market value of Applied’s common stock at the date
    of grant (see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements).



Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

At October 26, 2008, Applied’s investment portfolio
    included fixed-income securities with a fair value of
    approximately $2.2 billion. Applied’s primary
    objective for investing in fixed-income securities is to
    preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk.
    These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will
    decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on
    Applied’s investment portfolio at October 26, 2008 and
    October 28, 2007, an immediate 100 basis point
    increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the
    fair value of the portfolio of approximately $31 million
    and $31 million, respectively. While an increase in
    interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment
    portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the
    Consolidated Statement of Operations unless the individual
    fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss
    is determined to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

All of Applied’s debt bears interest at fixed rates.
    Therefore, an immediate 100 basis point increase in
    interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect
    on Applied’s near-term financial condition or results of
    operations.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign
    currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss
    francs. Applied enters into forward exchange and currency option
    contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and
    anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected
    to occur typically within 24 months. Gains and losses on
    these contracts are generally recognized in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations at the time that the related
    transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of
    movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and
    currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect
    on the underlying items being hedged, these financial
    instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that
    would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates.
    Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign currency gains and
    losses did not have a material effect on Applied’s results
    of operations for fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006.

Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency
    as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen, euro,
    Israeli shekel and Swiss francs), and the terms of the forward
    exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying
    transactions. Applied’s outstanding forward exchange
    contracts are marked-to-market (see Note 2 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements), as are the majority of the
    related underlying transactions being hedged; therefore, the
    effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is
    expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these
    changes on the underlying transactions. The effect of an
    immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward
    exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not
    expected to be material to Applied’s near-term financial
    condition or results of operations. Applied’s risk with
    respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium
    paid for the right to exercise the option. Premiums paid for
    options outstanding at October 26, 2008 were not material.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, management
    of Applied conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
    and operation of Applied’s disclosure controls and
    procedures, as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based
    upon that evaluation, Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer concluded that Applied’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
    period covered by this report in ensuring that information
    required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that
    information required to be disclosed by Applied in such reports
    is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
    management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Applied’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, management of Applied conducted an
    evaluation of the effectiveness of Applied’s internal
    control over financial reporting based upon the framework in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, Applied’s
    management concluded that Applied’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of October 26, 2008.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
    audited the consolidated financial statements included in this

Form 10-K

and, as part of the audit, has issued a report, included herein,
    on the effectiveness of Applied’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of October 26, 2008.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, there were no changes
    in the internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
    Applied’s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be
    met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in
    part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries’
    (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of
    October 26, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
    of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).
    The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining
    effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
    assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over
    financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 26, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by COSO.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Applied Materials, Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of October 26, 2008 and October 28,
    2007, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income, and cash
    flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    October 26, 2008. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the
    financial statement schedule as of and for each of the years in
    the three-year period ended October 26, 2008. Our report
    dated December 12, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule.

Applied has the following equity compensation plans that have
    not been approved by stockholders:

2000 Global Equity Incentive Plan

The 2000 Global Equity
    Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan) was adopted effective as of
    June 21, 2000. The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of
    non-qualified stock options to employees other than officers and
    directors. The administrator of the 2000 Plan (either the Board
    of Directors of Applied or a committee appointed by the Board)
    determines the terms and conditions of all stock options
    granted; provided, however, that (1) the exercise price
    generally may not be less than 100 percent of the fair
    market value (on the date of grant) of the stock covered by the
    option, and (2) the term of options can be no longer than
    10 years (or 13 years in the event of death). A total
    of 147,000,000 shares have been authorized for issuance
    under the 2000 Plan, and 40,540,000 shares remain available
    for issuance as of October 26, 2008.

Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees

The Stock
    Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees (the Offshore ESPP) was
    adopted effective as of October 16, 1995 for the benefit of
    employees of Applied’s participating affiliates (other than
    United States citizens or residents). The Offshore ESPP provides
    for the grant of options to purchase shares of Applied common
    stock through payroll deductions pursuant to one or more
    offerings. The administrator of the Offshore ESPP (the Board of
    Directors of Applied or a committee appointed by the Board)
    determines the terms and conditions of all options prior to the
    start of an offering, including the purchase price of shares,
    the number of shares covered by the option and when the option
    may be exercised. All options granted as part of an offering
    must be granted on the same date. A total of



12,800,000 shares have been authorized for issuance under
    the Offshore ESPP, and 1,210,000 shares remain available
    for issuance as of October 26, 2008.

Nonemployee Director Share Purchase Plan

The Applied
    Materials, Inc. Nonemployee Director Share Purchase Plan was
    adopted effective March 22, 2005. The Nonemployee Director
    Share Purchase Plan provides a method by which non-employee
    directors may purchase Applied common stock at 100% of fair
    market value on the purchase date by foregoing cash they have
    earned as retainer fees or meeting fees. The shares generally
    are purchased at the same time the directors otherwise would
    have been paid the fees in cash. Since the directors pay full
    fair market value for the shares, there is no reserved amount of
    shares under this plan and, accordingly, the table above does
    not include any set number of shares available for future
    issuance under the plan.

Applied Materials Profit Sharing Scheme

The Applied
    Materials Profit Sharing Scheme was adopted effective
    July 3, 1996 to enable employees of Applied Materials
    Ireland Limited and its participating subsidiaries to purchase
    Applied common stock at 100% of fair market value on the
    purchase date. Under this plan, eligible employees may elect to
    forego a certain portion of their base salary and certain
    bonuses they have earned and that otherwise would be payable in
    cash to purchase shares of Applied common stock at full fair
    market value. Since the eligible employees pay full fair market
    value for the shares, there is no reserved amount of shares
    under this plan and, accordingly, the table above does not
    include any set number of shares available for future issuance
    under the plan.

APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Applied Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied or the
    Company) after elimination of intercompany balances and
    transactions. All references to a fiscal year apply to
    Applied’s fiscal year which ends on the last Sunday in
    October. Fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 contained 52 weeks
    each. Each fiscal quarter of 2008, 2007 and 2006 contained
    13 weeks.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America requires management to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
    the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Cash
    Equivalents and Investments

All highly-liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three
    months or less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. All of Applied’s investments are classified as
    available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates.
    Investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at
    fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any temporary
    difference between the cost and fair value of an investment is
    presented as a separate component of accumulated other
    comprehensive income/(loss). The specific identification method
    is used to determine the gains and losses on investments.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
    determined on a

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is
    provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the
    straight-line method. Estimated useful lives for financial
    reporting purposes are as follows: buildings and improvements, 3
    to 30 years; demonstration and manufacturing equipment,
    3 to 5 years; software, 3 to 5 years; and
    furniture, fixtures and other equipment, 3 to 15 years.
    Land improvements are amortized over the shorter of
    15 years or the estimated useful life. Leasehold
    improvements are amortized over the shorter of five years or the
    lease term.

Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are
    reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of
    each fiscal year. Purchased technology and other intangible
    assets are presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization,
    and are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 1 to
    15 years using the straight-line method.

Long-Lived
    Assets

Applied reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    these assets may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these
    assets for impairment based on estimated future cash flows from
    these assets.

Research,
    Development and Engineering Costs

Research, development and engineering costs are expensed as
    incurred.



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Advertising
    Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs
    were not material for all periods presented.

Sales and
    Value Added Taxes

Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense is based on pretax earnings. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax
    bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses
    and tax credit carryforwards.

Revenue
    Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition
    criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
    seller’s price to buyer is fixed or determinable; and
    collectability is reasonably assured. Applied’s shipping
    terms are customarily FOB Applied shipping point or equivalent
    terms. Applied’s revenue recognition policy generally
    results in revenue recognition at the following points:
    (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the
    customer upon shipment, Applied recognizes revenue upon shipment
    for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product
    specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue
    associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred
    based on the estimated fair value, and that revenue is
    recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks;
    (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet
    product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized
    at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions
    where legal title does not pass at shipment, revenue is
    recognized when legal title passes to the customer, which is
    typically at customer technical acceptance; and (4) for
    arrangements containing multiple elements, the revenue relating
    to the undelivered elements is deferred at their estimated
    relative fair values until delivery of the deferred elements. In
    cases where Applied has sold products that have been
    demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment,
    Applied believes that at the time of delivery, it has an
    enforceable claim to amounts recognized as revenue. The
    completed contract method is used for
    SunFab

tm

thin film lines. Spare parts revenue is generally recognized
    upon shipment, and services revenue is generally recognized over
    the period that the services are provided.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Applied uses financial instruments, such as forward exchange and
    currency option contracts, to hedge a portion of, but not all,
    existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated
    transactions typically expected to occur within 24 months.
    The terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are
    generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being
    hedged. The purpose of Applied’s foreign currency
    management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate
    fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues,
    costs and eventual cash flows. All of Applied’s derivative
    financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon
    quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative
    instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of
    anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions, the
    effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is
    reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income/(loss) in stockholders’ equity, and is reclassified
    into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If
    the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of
    any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the
    associated financial instrument is recorded promptly in
    earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing
    foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or
    loss on these hedges is recorded promptly in earnings to offset
    the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being
    hedged. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments
    for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

As of October 26, 2008, primarily all of Applied’s
    subsidiaries use the United States dollar as their
    functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of
    these subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect
    at the end of the period, except for non-monetary assets, such
    as inventories and property, plant and equipment, which are
    translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs
    are translated using average exchange rates for the period,
    except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are
    translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting
    translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations as incurred.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject Applied to
    significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
    cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable and
    derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.
    Applied invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as,
    but not limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate and
    municipal bonds, United States Treasury and agency securities,
    and mortgage-backed securities, and, by policy, limits the
    amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution or
    commercial issuer. Applied’s customers consist principally
    of semiconductor and LCD manufacturers located throughout the
    world. Applied performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
    customers’ financial condition and generally requires no
    collateral to secure accounts receivable. Applied maintains an
    allowance reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts
    receivable based on its assessment of the collectibility of
    accounts receivable. Applied regularly reviews the allowance by
    considering factors such as historical experience, credit
    quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, and current
    economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to
    pay. In addition, Applied utilizes letters of credit to mitigate
    credit risk when considered appropriate. Applied is exposed to
    credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
    counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but does not
    expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings per share is determined using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted
    average number of common shares and potential common shares
    (representing the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted
    stock units, ESPP shares and amounts due under the agreements
    associated with the accelerated stock buyback program)
    outstanding during the period. Applied’s net income has not
    been adjusted for any period presented for purposes of computing
    basic or diluted earnings per share.

For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted
    average potential common shares do not include stock options
    with an exercise price greater than the average fair market
    value of Applied common stock for the period, as the effect
    would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, options to purchase
    36,423,000, 51,094,000 and 123,317,000 shares of common
    stock for the fiscal years ended October 26, 2008,
    October 28, 2007 and October 29, 2006, respectively,
    were excluded from the computation.

Equity-Based
    Compensation

Applied has adopted stock plans that permit grants to employees
    of equity-based awards, including stock options, restricted
    stock and restricted stock units (also referred to as
    “performance shares” under the Applied Materials, Inc.
    Employee Stock Incentive Plan). In addition, the Employee Stock
    Incentive Plan provides for the automatic grant of restricted
    stock units to non-employee directors and permits the grant of
    equity-based awards to consultants. Applied also has an Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) for United States employees, and a
    second ESPP for international employees, which enable eligible
    employees to purchase Applied common stock.

Effective October 31, 2005, Applied adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. 123 (Revised 2004), “Share-Based
    Payment” (SFAS 123(R)), using the modified

prospective transition method. Applied has included stock-based
    compensation costs in its results of operations for fiscal years
    2008, 2007 and 2006. The estimated fair value of Applied’s
    equity-based awards, less expected forfeitures, is amortized
    over the awards’ service period on a straight-line basis.

During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, Applied recognized total
    equity-based compensation expense related to stock options, ESPP
    shares, restricted stock units and restricted stock of
    $179 million (or $0.09 per diluted share),
    $161 million (of $0.08 per diluted share) and
    $216 million (or $0.11 per diluted share), respectively.
    During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, Applied recognized income tax
    benefits related to equity-based compensation of
    $50 million, $45 million and $46 million,
    respectively. The equity-based compensation expense related to
    restricted stock units and restricted stock for fiscal 2008,
    2007 and 2006 was $137 million, $104 million and
    $30 million, respectively.

Stock
    Options

The exercise price of each stock option equals the fair market
    value of Applied common stock on the date of grant. Most options
    are scheduled to vest over four years and expire no later than
    seven years from the grant date. The fair value of each option
    grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model. This model was developed for use in
    estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no
    vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Applied’s
    employee stock options have characteristics significantly
    different from those of publicly traded options. The weighted
    average assumptions used in the model are outlined in the
    following table:

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on a
    combination of historical and implied volatilities. When
    establishing the expected life assumption, Applied periodically
    reviews historical employee exercise behavior with respect to
    option grants with similar vesting periods.

Options outstanding had an aggregate intrinsic value of
    $0.6 million, $190 million and $165 million at
    October 26, 2008, October 28, 2007 and
    October 29, 2006, respectively. The total grant date fair
    value of options granted during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $34,000, $2 million and $54 million, respectively. The
    total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2008,
    2007 and 2006 was $54 million, $141 million and
    $57 million, respectively. The total fair value of options
    that vested during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was
    $55 million, $124 million and $256 million,
    respectively. At October 26, 2008, Applied had
    $13 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net
    of estimated forfeitures, related to stock option plans that
    will be recognized over the weighted average period of
    0.6 years. Cash received from stock option exercises was
    $328 million, $837 million and $284 million,
    respectively, during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006. The actual tax
    benefit realized for the tax deductions from options exercised
    for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 totaled $57 million,
    $50 million and $24 million, respectively. During
    fiscal 2006, as part of the acquisition of Applied Films
    Corporation (Applied Films), Applied assumed outstanding options
    to purchase Applied Films common stock that, at the acquisition
    date, had a fair value of $26 million, including
    $6 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net
    of $2 million of estimated forfeitures (see Note 12).
    The Applied Films stock options assumed by Applied were
    converted into options to purchase 3 million shares of
    Applied common stock.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase Applied
    common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to
    85 percent of the lower of the fair market value of Applied
    stock at the beginning of the applicable

offering period or at the end of each applicable purchase
    period. The number of shares issued under the ESPP during fiscal
    2008, 2007 and 2006 was 4,617,000 shares,
    4,310,000 shares and 4,065,000 shares, respectively.
    Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted
    average estimated fair value of purchase rights under the ESPP
    was $4.97 per share for the year ended October 26, 2008,
    $4.83 per share for the year ended October 28, 2007 and
    $5.21 per share for the year ended October 29, 2006.
    Compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of the
    employees’ purchase rights under the Black-Scholes model.

Restricted
    Stock Units and Restricted Stock

Restricted stock units are converted into shares of Applied
    common stock upon vesting on a one-for-one basis. Restricted
    stock units typically vest over three to four years. Vesting of
    restricted stock units usually is subject to the grantee’s
    continued service with Applied. The compensation expense related
    to these awards is determined using the fair value of Applied
    common stock on the date of the grant, and compensation is
    recognized over the vesting period.

At October 26, 2008, Applied had $224 million total
    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to restricted stock unit grants, which will be
    recognized over the weighted average period of 1.3 years
    (see Note 8). During fiscal 2006, as part of the
    acquisition of Applied Films, Applied assumed Applied
    Films’ outstanding restricted stock units that, at the
    acquisition date, had a fair value of $298,000, including
    $130,000 of total unrecognized equity-based compensation
    expense, net of estimated forfeitures. The Applied Films
    restricted stock units assumed were expected to convert into
    19,000 shares of Applied common stock upon vesting.

Beginning in fiscal 2007, Applied initiated a performance-based
    equity award program for named executive officers and other key
    employees. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee of
    Applied’s Board of Directors (the Committee) approved
    grants of 1,565,000 and 1,950,000 performance-based restricted
    stock units under this program for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007,
    respectively. The Committee also approved the issuance to
    Applied’s President and Chief Executive Officer of
    performance-based restricted stock in the amounts of 100,000 and
    150,000 shares for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007,
    respectively, at $0.01 per share. These awards vest only if
    specific performance goals set by the Committee are achieved.
    The goals require the achievement of specified levels of
    Applied’s annual operating profit as compared to
    Applied’s peer companies and also that the officer or key
    employee remain an employee of Applied through the vesting date.
    The fair value of the performance-based restricted stock awards
    and restricted stock is estimated using the fair value of
    Applied common stock on the date of the grant and assumes that
    the applicable performance goals will be achieved. If achieved,
    the award vests over a specified remaining service period. If
    such performance goals are not met, no compensation cost is
    recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is
    reversed. The expected cost of the award is reflected over the
    service period and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. The
    performance goals associated with the fiscal 2008 awards were
    achieved at 70%. The performance goals associated with the
    fiscal 2007 awards were achieved. Fiscal 2008 equity-based
    compensation expense included $21 million attributable to
    the performance-based awards granted in fiscal 2008 and fiscal
    2007. Fiscal 2007 equity-based compensation expense included
    $13 million attributable to the performance-based awards
    granted in fiscal 2007.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries

On October 28, 2007, Applied implemented the recognition
    and disclosure provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (SFAS) No. 158, “Employers’ Accounting
    for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans — an amendment of FASB Statements 87, 88, 106
    and 132(R)” (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 required Applied
    to recognize the funded status (the difference between the fair
    value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations) of
    the defined benefit plan in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with
    a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive
    income, net of tax, to measure the fair value of plan benefit
    obligations as of its fiscal year ending October 28, 2007
    and to provide additional disclosures. The implementation of
    SFAS 158 did not have a material impact on Applied’s
    financial statements. For additional information on
    Applied’s employee benefit plans, see Note 8.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In April 2008, Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued FASB Staff Position (FSP)

No. 142-3,

“Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible
    Assets”

(FSP 142-3).

FSP 142-3

amends the factors an entity should consider in developing
    renewal or extension assumptions used in determining the useful
    life of recognized intangible assets under FASB Statement
    No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”
    This new guidance applies prospectively to intangible assets
    that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets
    in business combinations and asset acquisitions.

FSP 142-3

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
    and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2008.
    Early adoption is prohibited. Applied is evaluating the
    potential impact of the implementation of

FSP 142-3

on its financial position and results of operations.

In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161,
    “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging
    Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133”
    (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 requires disclosures of how and
    why an entity uses derivative instruments, how derivative
    instruments and related hedged items are accounted for, and how
    derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an
    entity’s financial position, financial performance and cash
    flows. SFAS 161 will be effective for Applied in fiscal
    2010, with early adoption permitted. Applied is evaluating the
    potential impact of the implementation of SFAS 161 on its
    financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141
    (revised), “Business Combinations” (SFAS 141(R)).
    The standard changes the accounting for business combinations,
    including the measurement of acquirer shares issued in
    consideration for a business combination, the recognition of
    contingent consideration, the accounting for preacquisition gain
    and loss contingencies, the recognition of capitalized
    in-process research and development, the accounting for
    acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the treatment
    of acquisition related transaction costs, and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    SFAS 141(R) will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010,
    with early adoption prohibited. Applied is evaluating the
    potential impact of the implementation of SFAS 141(R) on
    its financial position and results of operations.

In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 160,
    “Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51”
    (SFAS 160). The standard changes the accounting for
    noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial
    statements, including the requirements to classify
    noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated
    stockholders’ equity, and the elimination of “minority
    interest” accounting in results of operations with earnings
    attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of
    consolidated earnings. Additionally, SFAS 160 revises the
    accounting for both increases and decreases in a parent’s
    controlling ownership interest. SFAS 160 will be effective
    for Applied in fiscal 2010, with early adoption prohibited.
    Applied is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation
    of SFAS 160 on its financial position and results of
    operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159,
    “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities Including an Amendment of FASB Statement
    No. 115” (SFAS 159), which permits entities to

elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other
    items at fair value that are not currently required to be
    measured at fair value. This election is irrevocable.
    SFAS 159 will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2009.
    Management does not believe the effect of implementing
    SFAS 159 will have a material impact on Applied’s
    financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value Measurements” (SFAS 157).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued

FSP 157-1,

“Application of FASB Statement No. 157 to FASB
    Statement No. 13 and Other Accounting Pronouncements That
    Address Fair Value Measurements for Purposes of Lease
    Classification or Measurement under Statement 13”

(FSP 157-1)

and

FSP 157-2,

“Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157”

(FSP 157-2).

FSP 157-1

amends SFAS 157 to remove certain leasing transactions from
    its scope.

FSP 157-2

delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all non-financial
    assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the
    beginning of Applied’s first quarter of fiscal 2010. The
    measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial
    assets and financial liabilities are effective for Applied
    beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In October 2008,
    the FASB issued

FSP 157-3,

“Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the
    Market for That Asset Is Not Active”

(FSP 157-3).

FSP 157-3

clarifies the application of SFAS 157 in a market that is
    not active, and provide guidance on the key considerations in
    determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market
    for that financial asset is not active. Applied will continue to
    evaluate the application of SFAS 157. Management does not
    believe the effect of implementing SFAS 157 will have a
    material impact on Applied’s financial position or results
    of operations.

At October 26, 2008, Applied had a gross unrealized loss of
    $48 million due to a decrease in the fair market value of
    certain fixed-rate debt and equity securities as a result of the
    recent turmoil in the global financial markets. Applied
    regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify and
    evaluate investments that have indications of possible
    impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is
    temporary include: the length of time and extent to which fair
    market value has been lower than the cost basis; the financial
    condition, credit quality and near-term prospects of the
    investee; and Applied’s ability to hold the investment for
    a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated
    recovery in fair market value. Generally, the contractual terms
    of the investments do not permit settlement at prices less than
    the amortized cost of the investments. Applied has determined
    that the gross unrealized losses on its investments at
    October 26, 2008 are temporary in nature. Accordingly,
    Applied does not consider the investments to be

Applied manages its cash equivalents and investments as a single
    portfolio of highly marketable securities that is intended to be
    available to meet Applied’s current cash requirements. For
    fiscal 2008, gross realized gains on sales of investments were
    $13 million, and gross realized losses were
    $15 million. For fiscal 2007, gross realized gains on sales
    of investments were $2 million, and gross realized losses
    were $2 million. For fiscal 2006, gross realized gains on
    sales of investments were $5 million, and gross realized
    losses were $28 million, principally attributable to the
    sale of investments to fund the accelerated stock buyback
    program discussed in Note 7.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign
    currency exchange contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet
    at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do
    not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective
    portion of any hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All
    of Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded
    at their fair value in other current assets or accounts payable
    and accrued expenses.

Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with
    certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as
    Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss francs. The purpose
    of Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the
    effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
    denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The terms
    of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally
    consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged.

Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward
    exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge
    certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions
    expected to occur typically within the next 24 months.
    Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and
    documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and
    are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion
    of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component
    of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) in
    stockholders’ equity and is reclassified into earnings when
    the hedged transaction affects earnings. Amounts included in
    accumulated



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

other comprehensive income/(loss) at October 26, 2008 will
    generally be reclassified into earnings within 24 months.
    Changes in the fair value of currency forward exchange and
    option contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from
    the assessment of effectiveness and are recognized in cost of
    products sold and general and administrative expenses. The
    change in option and forward time value was not material for
    fiscal 2008, 2007 or 2006. If the transaction being hedged fails
    to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective,
    Applied promptly recognizes the gain or loss on the associated
    financial instrument in general and administrative expenses. The
    amounts recognized due to anticipated transactions failing to
    occur were not material for all periods presented.

Forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain
    foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. These
    derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
    Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are
    recorded promptly in earnings to offset the changes in the fair
    value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

Derivative-related activity in accumulated other comprehensive
    income/(loss), net of taxes, was as follows:

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of Applied’s financial instruments,
    including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes
    payable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate
    fair value due to the short maturities of these financial
    instruments. At October 26, 2008, the carrying amount of
    long-term debt was $203 million and the estimated fair
    value was $198 million. At October 28, 2007, the
    carrying amount of long-term debt was $205 million and the
    estimated fair value was $226 million. The estimated fair
    value of long-term debt is based primarily on quoted market
    prices for the same or similar issues.

Goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are not amortized but
    are subject to annual reviews for impairment, which Applied
    performs during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Applied
    conducted these impairment tests in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007,
    and the results of these tests indicated that Applied’s
    goodwill and unamortized intangible assets were not impaired.
    Goodwill and unamortized intangible assets are also subject to
    review for impairment when circumstances or events occur during
    the year that indicate that the assets may be impaired. From
    October 28, 2007 to October 26, 2008, the change in
    goodwill was $168 million, primarily due to the acquisition
    of Baccini S.p.A. (Baccini), which was completed in the second
    quarter of fiscal 2008, and the acquisition of certain net
    assets of Edwards Vacuum, Inc. (Edwards), which was completed in
    the first quarter of fiscal 2008 (see Note 12). Other
    intangible assets that are not subject to amortization consist
    primarily of a trade name associated with the Metron Technology
    N.V. acquisition reported in the Applied Global Services
    segment. As of October 26, 2008 goodwill and unamortized
    intangible assets by reportable segment was: Energy and
    Environmental Solutions, $657 million; Silicon,
    $224 million; Applied Global Services, $196 million;

Borrowing
    Facilities

At October 26, 2008, Applied had credit facilities for
    unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to
    $1.2 billion, of which $1.0 billion is comprised of a

5-year

revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is
    scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for
    borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to
    one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance, and
    includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in
    compliance at October 26, 2008. No amounts were outstanding
    under this agreement at October 26, 2008. Of the remaining
    credit facilities, $152 million are with Japanese banks at
    rates indexed to their

    in compliance with all covenants. Aggregate debt maturities at
    October 26, 2008 were: $1 million in fiscal 2009,
    $1 million in fiscal 2010, $0.5 million in fiscal
    2011, and $200 million thereafter.

Restructuring
    and Asset Impairments

During fiscal 2008, Applied recognized restructuring charges of
    $40 million of which $29 million was associated with a
    global cost reduction plan, announced in fiscal 2008, and
    $11 million with a plan approved in fiscal 2007. During
    fiscal 2007, Applied recognized restructuring and asset
    impairment charges of $26 million, including
    $17 million in restructuring charges and $9 million in
    asset impairments. Fiscal 2007 restructuring and asset
    impairment charges included $30 million associated with the
    decision to cease development of beamline implant products,
    offset by $3 million in adjustments associated with
    subsequent sales of properties held for sale. During fiscal
    2006, Applied recognized restructuring and asset impairment
    charges of $212 million, including $128 million in
    asset impairments and $92 million in restructuring charges
    primarily associated with the closure of its Hayward, California
    facility, offset by $8 million in adjustments associated
    with realignment programs of prior years.

On January 15, 2008, Applied announced a global cost
    reduction plan (the Plan) that primarily affected its Silicon
    and Applied Global Services segments and related support
    organizations. As part of the Plan, Applied has made reductions
    to its global workforce through a combination of job elimination
    and attrition. In fiscal 2008, Applied recorded restructuring
    charges of $29 million, consisting primarily of employee
    termination costs to reduce its workforce. The affected
    employees were based in North America, Europe and Asia, and
    represented multiple functions.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied’s Board of
    Directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of
    Applied’s real estate and facilities portfolio (the
    Disinvestment Plan). Properties with an estimated fair value of
    $56 million were reported as assets held-for-sale and
    reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded
    an asset impairment charge of $124 million to write down
    the following properties to estimated fair value:
    (1) facilities in Narita, Japan, Chunan, Korea, Hillsboro,
    Oregon, and Danvers, Massachusetts; and (2) 26 acres
    of unimproved land in Hillsboro, Oregon. During fiscal 2006,
    Applied sold the Danvers facility for net proceeds of
    $16 million and recognized a gain of $4 million.
    During fiscal 2007, Applied sold the Hillsboro, Chunan, and
    Narita facilities and the Hillsboro land for total net proceeds
    of $38 million and recognized a gain of $3 million.
    Also in fiscal 2006, as part of the Disinvestment Plan, Applied
    recorded lease termination charges in the amount of
    $89 million, related to the closure of its leased Hayward,

Stock
    Repurchase Program

Since March 1996, Applied has systematically repurchased shares
    of its common stock in the open market. In March 2006, the Board
    of Directors approved a stock repurchase program for up to
    $5.0 billion in repurchases over the next three years
    ending in March 2009. Pursuant to this authorization, on
    September 18, 2006, Applied entered into accelerated stock
    buyback agreements with Goldman, Sachs & Co. (Goldman
    Sachs), under which Applied agreed to purchase from Goldman
    Sachs outstanding shares of Applied common stock for an initial
    purchase price of $2.5 billion. Under the agreements,
    Applied purchased 145 million shares of Applied common
    stock on September 18, 2006 at a price per share of $17.20,
    and Goldman Sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of
    shares in the open market over the following four months. At the
    end of the four month period, Applied was entitled to or subject
    to a price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average
    price of Applied common stock during the purchase period that
    could be settled, at Applied’s option, in cash or shares of
    Applied common stock. On January 24, 2007, Applied settled
    the price adjustment by payment of $132 million in cash to
    Goldman Sachs, resulting in an adjusted price per share of
    $18.08. The repurchase was funded with Applied’s existing
    cash and investments and reported as treasury stock.

On September 15, 2006, the Board of Directors approved a
    new stock repurchase program for up to $5.0 billion in
    repurchases over the next three years ending in September 2009,
    of which authorization for $2.3 billion of repurchases
    remained as of October 26, 2008. Under this authorization,
    Applied implemented a systematic stock repurchase program and
    may also make supplemental stock repurchases from time to time,
    depending on market conditions, stock price and other factors.
    In fiscal 2008, there were 83,163,000 shares of Applied
    common stock repurchased at an average price of $18.04 per
    share. In fiscal 2007, there were 60,561,000 shares
    repurchased at an average price of $19.81 per share.

Dividends

During fiscal 2008, Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share
    each. The fourth quarterly cash dividend declared in fiscal 2008
    was paid on December 4, 2008, to stockholders of record as
    of November 13, 2008. During fiscal 2007, Applied’s
    Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend in the
    amount of $0.05 per share and three quarterly cash dividends in
    the amount of $0.06 per share each. During fiscal 2006,
    Applied’s Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash
    dividend in the amount of $0.03 per share and three quarterly
    cash dividends in the amount of $0.05 per share each. Dividends
    paid during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 amounted to
    $325 million, $306 million and $251 million,
    respectively. Applied currently anticipates that it will
    continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the
    future, although the



APPLIED

declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of
    the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s
    financial condition, results of operations, capital
    requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as
    a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of
    Applied’s stockholders.

Employee

Stock
    Options

Applied grants options to employees and consultants to purchase

    value on the date of grant. Most options are scheduled to vest

Restricted
    Stock Units

Applied grants restricted stock units (referred to as
    performance shares under the Applied Materials, Inc. Employee
    Stock Incentive Plan). Restricted stock units typically vest
    over three to four years, subject to the grantee’s
    continued service to Applied on each vesting date.

Employees
    Stock Purchase Plan

Applied sponsors two Employee Stock Purchase Plans
    (collectively, ESPP) for the benefit of United States (U.S.) and
    international employees, respectively. The U.S. plan is
    qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase Applied
    common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to
    85 percent of the lower of the fair market value of the
    stock at the beginning of the applicable offering period or at
    the end of each purchase period. The ESPP provides for
    consecutive and overlapping offering periods of up to
    24 months in duration, with each offering period composed
    of four consecutive six-month purchase periods. ESPP
    contributions are limited to a maximum of 10 percent of an
    employee’s eligible compensation, up to a maximum of $6,500
    per six-month purchase period. ESPP participants are also
    limited to purchasing a maximum of 1,000 shares per
    purchase period. Shares issued under the ESPP were 4,617,000 for
    fiscal 2008, 4,310,000 for fiscal 2007, and 4,065,000 for fiscal
    2006. At October 26, 2008, there were
    71,742,000 shares available for future issuance under the
    ESPP.

Employee
    Bonus Plans

Applied has various employee bonus plans. A discretionary bonus
    plan provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax
    profits to Applied employees who are not eligible for other
    performance-based incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of
    eligible compensation. Other plans award annual bonuses to
    Applied’s executives and other key contributors based on
    the achievement of profitability

and/or

other
    specified performance criteria. Applied also has agreements with
    key technical employees that provide for additional compensation
    related to the success of new product development and
    achievement of specified profitability criteria. Charges to
    expense under these plans were $150 million for fiscal
    2008, $271 million for fiscal 2007 and $262 million
    for fiscal 2006.

Employee
    Savings and Retirement Plan

Applied’s Employee Savings and Retirement Plan (401(k)
    Plan) is qualified under Sections 401(a) and (k) of
    the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees may make salary
    deferral and

catch-up

contributions under the 401(k) Plan on a pre-tax basis. Applied
    matches a percentage of each participant’s salary deferral
    contributions with cash contributions. In general, these
    matching contributions become 20 percent vested at the end
    of an employee’s second year of service with Applied, and
    vest 20 percent per year of service thereafter, becoming
    fully vested at the end of six years of service. Participants
    may direct that funds held in their 401(k) Plan accounts,
    including any Applied matching contributions, be invested in any
    of the diversified investment funds available under the 401(k)
    Plan or in the Applied Materials, Inc. Common Stock Fund (Stock
    Fund), which invests solely in shares of Applied common stock.
    Effective June 21, 2007, the Stock Fund was converted into
    a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (within the
    meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code)
    and, as a result,

participants have the option of specifying that any future cash
    dividends paid on shares held in the Stock Fund be either
    reinvested in the Stock Fund or distributed directly to them in
    cash no later than 90 days after the calendar year for
    which the dividends were paid. Applied’s matching
    contributions under this plan were approximately
    $29 million, net of $2 million in forfeitures, for
    fiscal 2008, $28 million, net of $1 million in
    forfeitures, for fiscal 2007 and $27 million, net of
    $2 million in forfeitures, for fiscal 2006.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries and Other
    Post-Retirement Benefits

Several of Applied’s foreign subsidiaries have defined
    benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their
    eligible employees. Benefits under these plans are typically
    based on years of service and final average compensation levels.
    Applied uses August 31 as a measurement date. The plans are
    managed in accordance with applicable local statutes and
    practices. Applied deposits funds for certain of these plans
    with insurance companies, pension trustees, government-managed
    accounts,

and/or

accrues the expense for the unfunded portion of the benefit
    obligation on its consolidated financial statements.
    Applied’s practice is to fund the various pension plans in
    amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements as
    established by applicable local governmental oversight and
    taxing authorities. Depending on the design of the plan, local
    custom and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may
    exceed qualified plan assets. The differences between the
    aggregate projected benefit obligations and aggregate plan
    assets of these plans have been recorded as liabilities by
    Applied and are included in accrued expenses and other
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On October 28, 2007, Applied implemented the recognition
    and disclosure provisions of SFAS No. 158,
    “Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements 87, 88, 106 and 132(R)” (SFAS 158).
    SFAS 158 required Applied to recognize the funded status
    (the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the
    projected benefit obligations) of the defined benefit plan in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with a corresponding adjustment
    to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to
    measure the fair value of plan benefit obligations as of its
    fiscal year ending October 28, 2007 and to provide
    additional disclosures.

On January 1, 1999, Applied implemented a post-retirement
    plan that provides certain medical and vision benefits to
    eligible retirees who are at least age 55 and who have at
    least 10 years of service at their date of retirement. An
    eligible retiree may elect coverage for an eligible spouse or
    domestic partner who is not eligible for Medicare. Coverage
    under the plan generally ends for both the retiree and spouse or
    domestic partner upon becoming eligible for Medicare. As of
    October 26, 2008, Applied’s liability under this
    post-retirement plan was $9 million which was included in
    other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

On February 9, 2007, the Board of Directors of Applied
    approved a plan to cease development of beamline implant
    products for semiconductor manufacturing and curtail the
    operations of its Implant group based in Horsham, England (see
    Note 6). A reduction in force led to a curtailment loss of
    $629,000, which is included in restructuring and asset
    impairment expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

Applied’s investment strategy for its defined benefit plans
    is to invest assets in a prudent manner, maintaining
    well-diversified portfolios with the long-term objective of
    meeting the obligations of the plans as they come due. Asset
    allocation decisions are typically made by plan fiduciaries with
    input from Applied’s pension committee. Applied’s
    asset allocation strategy incorporates a sufficient equity
    exposure in order for the plans to benefit from the expected
    long-term outperformance of equities relative to the plans’
    liabilities. Applied retains investment managers, where
    appropriate, to manage the assets of the plans. Performance of
    investment managers is monitored by plan fiduciaries with the
    assistance of local investment consultants. The investment
    managers make investment decisions within the guidelines set
    forth by plan fiduciaries. Risk management practices include
    diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and
    periodic rebalancing toward target asset allocation ranges.
    Investment managers may use derivative instruments for efficient
    portfolio management purposes. Plan assets do not include any of
    Applied’s own equity or debt securities.

A summary of the components of net periodic benefit costs and
    the weighted average assumptions used for net periodic benefit
    cost and benefit obligation calculations for fiscal 2008, 2007

Future expected benefit payments for the pension plans and the
    post-retirement plan over the next ten fiscal years are:
    $7 million in fiscal 2009, $8 million in fiscal 2010,
    $9 million in fiscal 2011, $10 million in fiscal 2012,
    $10 million in fiscal 2013, and $60 million
    collectively for fiscal years 2014 through 2018. Company
    contributions to these plans for fiscal 2009 are expected to be
    approximately $14 million.

Executive
    Deferred Compensation Plans

Applied sponsors two unfunded deferred compensation plans, the
    Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (Predecessor EDCP) and the
    2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (2005 EDCP), under
    which certain employees may elect to defer a portion of their
    following year’s eligible earnings. The Predecessor EDCP
    was frozen as of December 31, 2004 such that no new
    deferrals could be made under the plan after that date and the
    plan would qualify for “grandfather” relief under
    Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Predecessor
    EDCP participant accounts continue to be maintained under the
    plan and credited with deemed interest. The 2005 EDCP was
    implemented by Applied effective as of January 1, 2005 and
    is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A
    of the Internal Revenue Code. Amounts payable, including accrued
    deemed interest, totaled $80 million at October 26,
    2008 and $82 million at October 28, 2007, which were
    included in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

    liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The balance as
    of October 28, 2007 includes an additional $2 million
    of deferred taxes for a purchase accounting adjustment.

A valuation allowance is recorded to reflect the estimated
    amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized. The
    valuation allowance has been established against capital loss
    carryforwards where it is believed that it is not more likely
    than not that sufficient capital gains will be realized within
    the remaining carryforward period.

For fiscal 2008, U.S. income taxes have not been provided
    for approximately $395 million of cumulative undistributed

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Applied intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in
    operations outside of the U.S.

As of October 26, 2008, Applied’s state R&D tax
    credit carryforward was $32 million. The carryforward has
    an indefinite life. Management believes that the tax credit
    carryforward will be utilized in future periods.

Applied’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax
    benefits associated with employee stock option transactions.
    These benefits, credited directly to stockholders’ equity,
    amounted to $7 million for fiscal 2008 and $50 million
    for fiscal 2007, with a corresponding reduction to taxes payable
    of $7 million in fiscal 2008 and $50 million in fiscal
    2007.

In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48,
    “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes”
    (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s
    financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
    “Accounting for Income Taxes” (SFAS 109). This
    interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and
    measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition
    and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
    in a tax return. Recognition of a tax position is determined
    when it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be
    sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related
    appeals or litigation processes. A tax position that meets the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured at the
    largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent
    likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing
    authority. FIN 48 also provides guidance on derecognition
    of tax benefits, classification on the balance sheet, interest
    and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure, and
    transition. Applied implemented FIN 48 effective
    October 29, 2007. Upon implementation of FIN 48
    Applied did not identify any increase or decrease in its
    liability for unrecognized tax benefits. In the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2008, Applied identified a tax position that met the
    more-likely-than-not recognition threshold. Applied determined
    that a tax benefit of $100 million existed upon
    implementation of FIN 48 and therefore made the correction
    to retained earnings. The impact of the correction was not
    considered material to the prior reporting periods. The
    beginning balance of the reconciliation of gross unrecognized
    tax benefits below reflects this tax position.

A reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of the
    total amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows

363,400

As of October 26, 2008, Applied had unrecognized tax
    benefits, net of federal deduction for state tax, of
    $350 million, all of which, if recognized, would result in
    a reduction of Applied’s effective tax rate.

Historically, unrecognized tax benefits have been classified as
    current income taxes payable. Under FIN 48, unrecognized
    tax benefits are classified as long-term income taxes payable
    except to the extent it is anticipated that cash payment will be
    made within the next year. As of October 26, 2008, the
    gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was
    $63 million, exclusive of interest and penalties. Under
    FIN 48, increases or decreases to interest and penalties on
    uncertain tax positions are included in provision for income
    taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Interest and
    penalties related to uncertain tax positions were
    $11 million as of October 28, 2007 and $8 million
    as of October 26, 2008. Of the $8 million in interest
    and penalties, $5 million is classified as long-term
    payable and $3 million is classified as current payable in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is
    highly uncertain as well as the amounts and timing of various
    tax payments that may be part of the settlement process. This
    could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet
    classification of current assets and non-current assets and
    liabilities. The Company believes that before the end of fiscal
    2009, it is reasonably possible that the statute of limitations
    on certain income taxes will expire. Given the uncertainty as to
    ultimate settlement terms, the timing of payment and the impact
    of such settlements on other uncertain tax positions, the range
    of the estimated potential decrease in underlying unrecognized
    tax benefits is between $0 and $10 million.

A number of Applied’s tax returns remain subject to
    examination by taxing authorities. These include
    U.S. federal returns for 2005 and later years, tax returns
    for certain states for 2002 and later years, and tax returns in
    certain jurisdictions outside of the U.S. for 2003 and
    later years.

Industry
    Segment and Geographic Operations

Applied’s four reportable segments are: Silicon, Applied
    Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental
    Solutions. Prior to the first quarter of fiscal 2008, the
    Applied Global Services segment was named Fab Solutions, and the
    Energy and Environmental Solutions segment was named Adjacent
    Technologies. Applied’s chief operating decision-maker has
    been identified as the President and Chief Executive Officer,
    who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating
    resources and assessing performance for the entire company.
    Segment information is presented based upon Applied’s
    management organization structure as of October 26, 2008
    and the distinctive nature of each segment. Future changes to
    this internal financial structure may result in changes to the
    reportable segments disclosed. Prior to the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006, Applied operated in one reportable segment.

Each reportable segment is separately managed and has separate
    financial results that are reviewed by Applied’s chief
    operating decision-maker. Each reportable segment contains
    closely related products that are unique to the particular
    segment. Segment operating income is determined based upon
    internal performance measures used by Applied’s chief
    operating decision-maker.

Applied derives the segment results directly from its internal
    management reporting system. The accounting policies Applied
    uses to derive reportable segment results are substantially the
    same as those used for external reporting purposes. Management
    measures the performance of each reportable segment based upon
    several metrics including orders, net sales and operating
    income. Management uses these results to evaluate the
    performance of,

and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments.
    Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain
    operating expenses that it manages separately at the corporate
    level, which include costs related to equity-based compensation
    and certain components of variable compensation, corporate
    marketing and sales, corporate functions (certain management,
    finance, legal, human resources and RD&E), and unabsorbed
    information technology and occupancy. In addition, Applied does
    not allocate to its reportable segments restructuring and asset
    impairment charges and any associated adjustments related to
    restructuring actions. Segment operating income excludes
    interest income/expense and other financial charges and income
    taxes according to how a particular reportable segment’s
    management is measured. Management does not consider the
    unallocated costs in measuring the performance of the reportable
    segments.

Effective the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied changed the
    management reporting system for services to report all service
    results in the Applied Global Services segment. Applied has
    reclassified segment operating results for fiscal 2007 and 2006
    to conform to the fiscal 2008 presentation.

The Silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for
    etch, rapid thermal processing (RTP), deposition, chemical
    mechanical planarization (CMP), and metrology and inspection.

The Applied Global Services segment includes technically
    differentiated products and services to improve the operating
    efficiency, reduce operating costs and lessen the environmental
    impact of semiconductor, display and solar customers’
    factories. Applied Global Services’ products consist of
    spares, services, certain earlier generation products, and
    remanufactured equipment. Customer demand for these products and
    services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with
    trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer
    sites.

The Display segment encompasses products for manufacturing LCDs
    for TVs, personal computers and other video-enabled devices. The
    Display segment also includes design and manufacture of
    differentiated stand-alone equipment for the Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film
    Line.

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products
    for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules, high
    throughput roll-to-roll coating systems for flexible electronics
    and web products, and systems used in the manufacture of
    energy-efficient glass.

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

Applied leases some of its facilities and equipment under
    non-cancelable operating leases and has options to renew most
    leases, with rentals to be negotiated. Total rent expense was
    $68 million for fiscal 2008, $62 million for fiscal
    2007, and $70 million for fiscal 2006. Future minimum lease
    payments at October 26, 2008 totaled $118 million and
    were: $58 million for fiscal 2009; $30 million for
    fiscal 2010; $14 million for fiscal 2011; $8 million
    for fiscal 2012; $5 million for fiscal 2013; and
    $3 million collectively for all periods thereafter.

Discounted
    Letters of Credit

Applied discounts letters of credit through various financial
    institutions. Under these agreements, Applied discounted letters
    of credit in the amounts of $167 million for fiscal 2008,
    $431 million for fiscal 2007 and $237 million for
    fiscal 2006. Discounting fees were not material for all periods
    presented. In fiscal 2008, Applied factored accounts receivables
    totaling $125 million.

Warranty

Applied products are generally sold with a

12-month

warranty period following installation. The provision for the
    estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is
    recognized. Parts and labor are covered under the terms of the
    warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based on
    historical experience by product, configuration and geographic
    region.

    to the current year’s net sales, and warranty consumption
    is associated with current and prior year’s net sales.

Guarantees

During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 26, 2008, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee agreements was
    approximately $167 million. Applied has not recorded any
    liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements below
    that required to appropriately account for the underlying
    transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on
    historical experience and information currently available, that
    it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid
    under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate
    subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft
    arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of
    credit. As of October 26, 2008, Applied Materials Inc. has
    provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately
    $168 million to cover these services.

Legal
    Matters

Jusung

On December 24, 2003, Applied filed a lawsuit against
    Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. (Jusung Engineering) and Jusung
    Pacific Co., Ltd. (Jusung Pacific, referred to together with
    Jusung Engineering as Jusung) in Tao-Yuan District Court in
    Taiwan, captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung
    Engineering Co., Ltd. The lawsuit alleges that Jusung is
    infringing an Applied patent related to chemical vapor
    deposition (CVD). In the lawsuit, Applied sought a provisional
    injunction prohibiting Jusung from importing, using,
    manufacturing, servicing or selling in Taiwan certain flat panel
    display manufacturing equipment. On January 14, 2004, the
    Tao-Yuan District Court issued a provisional injunction order
    against Jusung Pacific. Jusung Pacific’s appeal of the
    order was denied. Jusung Pacific requested permission to post a
    counterbond to have the Jusung Pacific injunction lifted, which
    was granted, and on March 30, 2004, the provisional
    injunction order was lifted. At Applied’s request, on
    December 11, 2004, the District Court issued a provisional
    injunction order against Jusung Engineering. Jusung
    Engineering’s appeal of the order was denied. Jusung
    Engineering requested permission to post a counterbond to have
    the Jusung Engineering injunction lifted, which was granted, and
    on April 25, 2005, the provisional injunction order against
    Jusung Engineering was lifted. On June 30, 2004, Applied
    filed a “main action” patent infringement complaint
    against Jusung in the Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan,
    captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung Engineering
    Co., Ltd. In the lawsuit, Applied seeks damages and a permanent
    injunction for infringement of the same CVD patent. The
    decisions regarding the provisional injunction and counterbond
    have no effect on the main action patent infringement lawsuit
    filed by Applied. In August 2006, the Hsinchu Court set the
    litigation fee and the litigation security payment, and the main
    action is now proceeding on its merits. This same patent is also
    the subject of an invalidity proceeding filed in the Taiwanese
    Intellectual Property Office (TIPO) by Jusung Pacific in June
    2004. In July 2007, the TIPO allowed Applied to amend its patent
    and dismissed Jusung Pacific’s invalidation action. Jusung
    Pacific’s initial appeal was denied and it has filed a
    further appeal to the Taipei High Administrative Court. Applied
    believes that it has meritorious claims and defenses that it
    intends to pursue vigorously.

On April 10, 2004, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC)
    notified Applied’s subsidiary, AKT America, Inc. (AKT
    America), that, following a complaint filed by Jusung, the TFTC
    had begun an investigation into whether AKT America had violated
    the Taiwan Fair Trade Act, and specifically whether AKT America
    violated the Taiwan Guidelines for the Review of Cases Involving
    Enterprises Issuing Warning Letters for Infringement on
    Copyright, Trademark and Patent Rights by allegedly notifying
    customers about AKT America patent rights and the infringement
    of those rights by Jusung. On June 15, 2004, the TFTC
    notified Applied that Applied also was the subject of the
    investigation. The TFTC subsequently notified Applied and AKT
    America that there was insufficient evidence to support a claim
    against either company. Jusung appealed the TFTC’s
    decision, and the appeals court affirmed the decision of the
    TFTC. Jusung appealed the appeals court’s affirmation of
    the decision of the TFTC, and in January 2007, the Taipei High
    Administrative Court dismissed Jusung’s appeal. In February
    2007, Jusung appealed the dismissal to the Supreme
    Administrative Court of Taiwan. Applied believes that
    Jusung’s complaint is without merit.

On June 13, 2006, Applied filed an action in the TIPO
    challenging the validity of a patent owned by Jusung Engineering
    related to severability of the transfer chamber. On
    June 20, 2006, Jusung Engineering filed a lawsuit against
    Applied and AKT America, in Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan,
    captioned Jusung Engineering, Co. Ltd. v. AKT America, Inc.
    and Applied Materials, Inc., alleging infringement of this
    patent. Jusung Engineering’s lawsuit seeks damages, costs
    and attorneys’ fees. Applied believes that it has
    meritorious defenses that it intends to pursue vigorously.

On January 31, 2007, Applied received notice that Jusung
    Engineering filed a complaint of private prosecution in the
    Taipei District Court of Taiwan dated November 10, 2006,
    entitled Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. v. M. Splinter,
    Y. Lin, C. Lai and J. Lin. The complaint alleges that
    Applied’s outside counsel received from the Court and used
    a copy of an expert report that Jusung had filed in the ongoing
    patent infringement lawsuits and that Jusung had intended to
    remain confidential. The complaint names as defendants
    Applied’s outside counsel in Taiwan, as well as Michael R.

Applied. On April 27, 2007, the Taipei District Court
    dismissed the private prosecution complaint. Jusung Engineering
    filed an appeal of the dismissal to the High Court. The High
    Court affirmed the District Court’s rejection of the
    private prosecution complaint on June 25, 2007. After the
    dismissal of the private prosecution complaint, the matter was
    transferred to the Taipei District Attorney’s Office, which
    issued a ruling not to prosecute. This ruling was reviewed by
    the Taiwan High Court District Attorney, which in October 2007
    returned the matter to the Taipei District Attorney’s
    Office for further consideration. On March 7, 2008, the
    Taipei District Attorney’s Office issued a second ruling
    not to prosecute, which Jusung Engineering appealed. The Taiwan
    High Court District Attorney returned the matter to the Taipei
    District Attorney’s Office for further investigation and
    the Taipei District Attorney’s office decided not to pursue
    the matter. Applied believes that it has meritorious defenses
    that it intends to pursue vigorously.

On April 3, 2007, Jusung Engineering filed a complaint
    against AKT America and one of its suppliers in Seoul Central
    District Court in Seoul, Korea, captioned Jusung Engineering,
    Co. Ltd. v. AKT America, Inc. The complaint alleges
    infringement of a Jusung patent involving the showerhead
    assembly of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD)
    equipment for liquid crystal displays (LCDs) and seeks
    injunctive relief. On June 9, 2007, AKT America and its
    supplier filed a patent invalidation action with the Korean
    Intellectual Property Office (KIPO). On November 30, 2007,
    the KIPO ruled that the Jusung patent was invalid, and Jusung
    Engineering has appealed the KIPO’s ruling. Also on
    November 30, 2007, KIPO dismissed the confirmation of scope
    action and Jusung appealed the decision. On December 4,
    2008, the Patent Court remanded the case back to KIPO for
    further consideration. On April 3, 2008, the Seoul District
    Court dismissed the complaint for infringement and Jusung
    Engineering has appealed this decision. Applied believes that it
    has meritorious defenses that it intends to pursue vigorously.

On August 13, 2007, Applied filed a complaint against
    Jusung Engineering in the Seoul Central District Court in Seoul,
    Korea, captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung
    Engineering Ltd. The complaint alleges infringement of an
    Applied patent involving a substrate support or housing for a
    substrate supporting pin used in PECVD equipment for LCDs and
    seeks both monetary damages and injunctive relief. On
    October 29, 2007, Jusung filed an action with the KIPO
    seeking to invalidate Applied’s substrate patent. Applied
    initiated a confirmation of scope action with the KIPO based on
    the same patent, which the KIPO dismissed on January 30,
    2008. Applied has appealed this decision to the Patent Court.
    Applied believes that it has meritorious claims in this action
    that it intends to pursue vigorously.

Silicon
    Services Consortium

On January 19, 2006, five companies that sold refurbished
    Applied tools (Silicon Services Consortium Inc., Semiconductor
    Support Services Co., OEM Surplus, Inc., Precision Technician
    Inc., and Semiconductor Equipment Specialist, Inc.) filed a
    lawsuit against Applied in the United States District Court for
    the Western District of Texas, captioned Silicon Services
    Consortium, Inc., et al. v. Applied Materials, Inc. The
    plaintiffs claimed that a policy that Applied announced in
    January 2005 of limiting the sale of certain parts to them
    constituted an unlawful attempt to monopolize the refurbishment
    business, an interference with existing contracts, and an
    interference with prospective business relationships. The suit
    sought injunctive relief, damages, costs and attorneys’
    fees. On January 17, 2007, Applied filed a counterclaim
    asserting claims for patent infringement, trademark
    infringement, trademark dilution, unfair competition, and misuse
    and misappropriation of trade secrets against each of the five
    plaintiffs/counter defendants, seeking damages as well as
    injunctive relief. All claims between Applied and Precision
    Technician were dismissed in September 2007 pursuant to a
    settlement, with no payment by either party. In December 2007,
    Applied reached a settlement with Semiconductor Equipment
    Specialist of all pending claims between them for an amount that
    was not material to Applied. In May 2008, Applied reached a
    settlement with Semiconductor Support Services of all pending
    claims between them in an amount that was not material to
    Applied. In July 2008, Applied reached a settlement with the
    remaining plaintiffs/counter defendants, Silicon Services
    Consortium and OEM Surplus, of all pending claims between them
    in an amount that was not material to Applied, and the lawsuit
    has been dismissed.

Business
    Combinations and Equity-Method Investment

On January 31, 2008, Applied acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately-held company based in
    Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of
    cash and marketable securities acquired. The acquired business
    is a leading supplier of automated metallization and test
    systems for manufacturing c-Si photovoltaic cells. In connection
    with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $158 million and intangible assets of $130 million. Of
    the $130 million of acquired intangible assets,
    $61 million was assigned to acquired backlog (to be
    amortized over 2 years), $34 million was assigned to
    customer relationships (to be amortized over 9 years),
    $27 million was assigned to purchased technology (to be
    amortized over 7 years), $6 million was assigned to
    covenants not to compete (to be amortized over 2 years),
    and $3 million was assigned to trademarks and tradenames
    (to be amortized over 7 years). The allocation of the
    purchase price was based on estimates of the fair value of the
    assets acquired and is subject to adjustment upon finalization
    of the purchase price allocation. The acquired business is
    reported under the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.

On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum,
    Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts
    cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. The
    acquisition expanded Applied’s existing Chamber Performance
    Services network of facilities that provide customers worldwide
    with technology and support for maintaining their chamber
    components. In connection with this acquisition, Applied
    recorded goodwill of $13 million and an intangible asset of
    $3 million (customer relationships, which will be amortized
    over 13 years). The acquired business is reported under the
    Applied Global Services segment.

On August 23, 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding
    shares of Switzerland-based HCT for $463 million in cash,
    net of cash acquired. The acquired business is a leading
    supplier of precision wafering systems used principally in
    manufacturing c-Si substrates for the solar industry. In
    connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $354 million and other intangible assets of
    $180 million. Of the $180 million of acquired
    intangible assets, $59 million was assigned to purchased
    technology (to be amortized over 11 years),
    $59 million was assigned to customer relationships (to be
    amortized over 7 years), $47 million was assigned to
    acquired backlog (to be amortized over 1 year),
    $8 million was assigned to trademarks and tradenames (to be
    amortized over 13 years), and $7 million was assigned
    to covenants not to compete (to be amortized over 3 years).
    The acquired business is reported under the Energy and
    Environmental Solutions segment.

On March 30, 2007, Applied purchased Brooks Software, a
    division of Brooks Automation, Inc., for $137 million in
    cash. The acquired business is a leading provider of factory
    management and control software to the semiconductor and flat
    panel display industries. The products complement Applied’s
    existing software applications and enable Applied to offer
    customers a comprehensive computer integrated manufacturing
    (CIM) solution for optimizing fab operations. Applied
    recorded an in-process research and development (IPR&D)
    expense of $5 million, reported as research, development
    and engineering expense, goodwill of $77 million, and other
    intangible assets of $47 million. Of the $47 million
    of acquired intangible assets, $21 million was assigned to
    purchased technology (to be amortized over 4 to 11 years),
    $21 million was assigned to maintenance contracts (to be
    amortized over 7 years), $2 million was assigned to
    acquired backlog (to be amortized over 1 year),
    $2 million was assigned to trademarks and tradenames (to be
    amortized over 7 years), and $1 million was assigned
    to customer

relationships (to be amortized over 4 years). The acquired
    business is reported under the Applied Global Services segment.

The acquired IPR&D expense was determined by identifying
    research projects for which technological feasibility had not
    been established and no alternative future use existed. The
    value of the projects identified as in-process was determined by
    estimating the future cash flows from the projects once
    commercially feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to
    their present value at a rate commensurate with the level of
    risk and maturity of the projects, and then applying a
    percentage of completion to the calculated value.

On August 14, 2006, Applied’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Metron Technology, Inc. (Metron), purchased certain assets of
    UMS Solutions’ parts cleaning and recycling business in
    Singapore for $10 million. The acquisition enhances
    Metron’s capabilities in Southeast Asia with advanced,
    high-quality parts cleaning services to support its
    customers’ semiconductor manufacturing requirements. In
    connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $7 million and other intangible assets of $1 million.

On July 20, 2006, Applied and Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co.,
    Ltd. (Screen) completed the formation of Sokudo Co. Ltd.
    (Sokudo), a Japanese joint venture company, to deliver advanced
    track solutions for customers’ critical semiconductor
    manufacturing requirements. Screen owns 52 percent and
    holds the controlling interest in Sokudo, and Applied owns
    48 percent. Screen transferred into Sokudo its existing
    track business and related intellectual property, including
    employees, products and its installed base of systems. Applied
    paid $147 million for its investment in Sokudo.
    Additionally, Applied contributed to Sokudo certain technology
    and related intellectual property and has provided key
    development employees. Screen performs manufacturing for Sokudo
    under an outsourcing agreement. Applied accounts for its
    interest in Sokudo under the equity method of accounting. Under
    this accounting method, Applied’s exposure to loss from
    ongoing operations is limited to $80 million as of
    October 26, 2008, which represents Applied’s carrying
    value of its investment in Sokudo. Applied’s investment in
    Sokudo is classified as an equity-method investment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Applied’s investment in Sokudo
    includes the unamortized excess of Applied’s investment
    over its equity in the joint venture’s net assets. This
    excess $28 million at October 26, 2008 is being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful
    life of 7 years.

On July 7, 2006, Applied completed its acquisition of
    Applied Films Corporation, a Colorado corporation (Applied
    Films) and leading supplier of thin film deposition equipment
    used in manufacturing LCDs, solar cells, flexible electronics
    and energy-efficient glass. Applied paid $28.50 per share in
    cash for each outstanding share of Applied Films. The total
    purchase price was approximately $484 million, or
    $328 million net of Applied Films’ existing cash and
    marketable securities. As part of the acquisition, Applied
    assumed Applied Films’ outstanding stock options and
    restricted stock awards that, at the acquisition date, had a
    total fair value of $26 million, of which $18 million
    was allocated to the purchase price and the remainder to
    unearned compensation. Upon the acquisition and subject to
    vesting, Applied Films stock options became exercisable for
    shares of Applied common stock and Applied Films restricted
    stock awards became payable in shares of Applied common stock
    totaling, in the aggregate, 3 million shares of Applied
    common stock. The fair value of Applied Films’ stock
    options assumed was determined using a Black-Scholes model. The
    use of the Black-Scholes model and method of determining the
    variables is consistent with Applied’s valuation of
    equity-based compensation awards in accordance with
    SFAS 123(R) (see Note 1). Applied recorded an
    in-process research and development expense of $14 million,
    reported as research, development and engineering expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations; goodwill of
    $226 million; and other intangible assets of
    $140 million. The acquired in-process research and
    development expense was determined by identifying research
    projects for which technological feasibility had not been
    established and no alternative future use existed. The value of
    the projects identified as in-process was determined by
    estimating the future cash flows from the projects once
    commercially feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to
    their present value at a rate commensurate with the level of
    risk and maturity of the projects, and then applying a
    percentage of completion to the calculated value.

On December 23, 2005, Applied acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of ChemTrace Corporation and ChemTrace
    Precision Cleaning, Inc. for approximately $22 million in
    cash, net of cash acquired, of which $18 million was paid
    upon closing. This business provides customers with precision
    parts cleaning and materials testing solutions. In connection
    with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $12 million and other intangible assets of $8 million.

For all of the purchase business combinations discussed above,
    the results of operations prior to the acquisition dates were
    not material in relation to those of Applied for any of the
    periods presented herein. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    reviewed periodically for impairment and purchased technology is
    amortized over its useful life of 1 to 15 years.

Subsequent
    Events

On November 12, 2008, Applied announced that it will
    implement a restructuring program beginning in the first quarter
    of fiscal 2009. As part of this program, Applied plans to reduce
    its global workforce by approximately 1,800 positions or 12% by
    the end of fiscal 2009 through a combination of attrition,
    voluntary separation and other workforce reduction programs
    consistent with local legal requirements and in consultation
    with employee representatives.

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    October 26, 2008 and October 28, 2007, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income, and cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended October 26, 2008. In
    connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
    statements, we also have audited the financial statement
    schedule as of and for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended October 26, 2008, as set forth under
    Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    October 26, 2008 and October 28, 2007, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended October 26, 2008, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
    schedule as of and for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended October 26, 2008, when considered in relation
    to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole,
    presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set
    forth therein.

As discussed in note 9 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective October 29, 2007, the Company adopted
    the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board
    Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in
    Income Taxes.

As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, effective October 28, 2007, the Company adopted
    the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (SFAS) No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined
    Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans — an
    amendment of FASB Statement No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R).

As discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements,
    effective October 31, 2005, the Company adopted the
    provisions of SFAS 123(R), Share-Based Payment.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 26, 2008, based on
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated
    December 12, 2008 expressed an unqualified opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.
