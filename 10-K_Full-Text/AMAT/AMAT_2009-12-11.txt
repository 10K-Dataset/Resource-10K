TABLE OF
    CONTENTS


PART I

Item 1:

Business

Incorporated in 1967, Applied, a Delaware corporation, provides
    Nanomanufacturing
    Technology

tm

solutions for the global semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar and related industries, with a broad portfolio of
    innovative equipment, service and software products.
    “Nanomanufacturing” is the production of ultra-small
    structures, including the engineering of thin films on
    substrates. Applied’s customers include manufacturers of
    semiconductor wafers and chips, flat panel liquid crystal
    displays (LCDs), solar photovoltaic cells and modules (solar
    PVs), and other electronic devices, who use what they
    manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other
    companies for use in advanced electronic components. The
    Company’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October.

Applied is the world’s largest semiconductor fabrication
    equipment supplier based on revenue, with the capability to
    provide global deployment and support services. Applied also is
    the leading supplier of LCD fabrication equipment to the flat
    panel display industry and in 2009 Applied was named by VLSI
    Research as the leading supplier of solar PV manufacturing
    systems to the solar industry.

Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon, Applied
    Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental
    Solutions. A summary of financial information for each
    reportable segment is found in Note 12 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. A discussion of factors that
    could affect Applied’s operations is set forth under
    “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, which is incorporated
    herein by reference.

Silicon
    Segment

Applied’s Silicon Systems Group (SSG), reported under its
    Silicon segment, develops, manufactures and sells a wide range
    of manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor
    chips, also referred to as integrated circuits (ICs). Most chips
    are built on a silicon wafer base and include a variety of
    circuit components, such as transistors and other devices, that
    are connected by multiple layers of wiring (interconnects).
    Applied offers systems that perform most of the primary
    processes used in chip fabrication including atomic layer
    deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical
    vapor deposition (PVD), etch, rapid thermal processing (RTP),
    chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) and wafer metrology and
    inspection, as well as systems that etch, measure and inspect
    circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography process.
    Applied’s semiconductor manufacturing systems are used by
    both integrated device manufacturers and foundries to build
    memory, logic and other types of chips.

To build a chip, the transistors, capacitors and other circuit
    components are first created on the surface of the wafer by
    performing a series of processes to deposit and selectively
    remove portions of successive film layers. Similar processes are
    then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer.
    As the density of the circuit components increases to enable
    greater computing capability in the same or smaller physical
    area, the complexity of building the chip also increases,
    necessitating more process steps to form smaller structures and
    more intricate wiring schemes. A typical, simplified process
    sequence for building the wiring or interconnect portion of a
    chip involves initially depositing a dielectric film layer onto
    the base layer of circuit components using a CVD system. An etch
    system is then used to create openings and patterns in the
    dielectric layer. To form the metal interconnects, these
    openings and patterns are subsequently filled with conducting
    material using PVD

and/or

electroplating technologies. A CMP step then polishes the wafer
    to achieve a flat surface. Additional deposition, etch and CMP
    steps are then performed to build up the layers needed to
    complete the interconnection of the circuit elements. Advanced
    chip designs require more than 500 steps involving these and
    other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle.

While some device manufacturers are still using aluminum as the
    main conducting material for building interconnect structures,
    most have transitioned to copper. Copper has lower resistance
    than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller area.
    Applied is the leading supplier of systems for manufacturing
    copper-based chips, including equipment for depositing, etching
    and planarizing copper interconnect layers. Complementing the
    transition to copper to improve chip speed is the use of low
    dielectric constant (low k) films to replace silicon



dioxide material as the insulator between the copper wiring
    structures. Applied also leads the industry in providing systems
    for depositing low k dielectric films.

The transistor is another key area of the chip where
    semiconductor manufacturers are improving their device designs
    to enhance speed. Applied has the industry’s largest
    portfolio of technically advanced products for building smaller
    and faster transistors. One method of enhancing chip performance
    is strain engineering, a technique that stretches or compresses
    the space between atoms, allowing electrical current to flow
    more quickly. Multiple strain films are typically used in
    advanced devices since they have an additive effect on
    increasing transistor speed. Applied has a comprehensive
    portfolio of systems to enable these applications using CVD and
    epitaxial deposition technologies.

Most chips currently are fabricated using 65 nanometer (nm) and
    larger linewidth dimensions, although Applied is also working
    with customers on new technology for advanced nodes such as 45nm
    and below. Major chipmakers have announced that they will be
    integrating new high dielectric constant (high-k) and metal
    materials and processes in their transistor gate structures to
    increase chip performance and reduce power consumption. Applied
    has a comprehensive portfolio of fully characterized processes
    for building these high-k/metal gates. These solutions include
    an integrated dielectric gate stack tool that combines four
    critical processes in a single system, a portfolio of
    metallization technologies using ALD and PVD, and an innovative
    high temperature etch system.

Another emerging area for Applied’s technology is
    three-dimensional (3D) ICs in which chips are vertically stacked
    to deliver higher performance and functionality in a smaller
    area. The individual chips are electrically connected using deep
    holes called through-silicon vias (TSVs). Applied has the
    production-proven systems and processes required for the
    majority of TSV manufacturing steps, including mask, etch, film
    deposition and CMP systems. Applied is leading efforts to enable
    the adoption of TSV technology, working with consortiums and
    other equipment suppliers to lower the cost to customers for
    implementing TSV technology.

Most of Applied’s semiconductor equipment products are
    single-wafer systems with multiple process chambers attached to
    a base platform. This enables each wafer to be processed
    separately in its own environment, allowing precise process
    control, while the system’s multiple chambers enable
    simultaneous, high productivity manufacturing. Applied sells
    most of its single-wafer, multi-chamber systems on four basic
    platforms: the
    Centura

®

,

    the
    Endura

®

,

    the
    Producer

®

and the
    Vantage

®

.

    These platforms support ALD, CVD, PVD, etch and RTP technologies.

Over time, the semiconductor industry has migrated to
    increasingly larger wafers to build chips. The predominant or
    common wafer size used today for volume production of advanced
    chips is 300 millimeter (mm), or

12-inch,

wafers. Applied offers a comprehensive range of 300mm systems.
    Applied also offers earlier-generation 200mm systems, as well as
    products and services to support all of its systems, which are
    reported under its Applied Global Services segment.

The following summarizes Applied’s portfolio of products
    and their associated process technology areas reported under its
    Silicon segment.

Deposition

Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a chip. During
    deposition, layers of dielectric (an insulator), barrier, or
    electrically conductive (typically metal) films are deposited or
    grown on a wafer. Applied currently provides equipment to
    perform three types of deposition: ALD, CVD and PVD. In
    addition, Applied’s RTP systems can be used to perform
    certain types of dielectric deposition.

Atomic
    Layer Deposition

ALD is an advanced technology in which atoms are deposited one
    layer at a time to build chip structures. This technology
    enables customers to fabricate thin films of either conducting
    or insulating material with uniform coverage in

sub-nanometer

sized structures. Applied offers ALD chambers for depositing
    tungsten and

high-k/metal

gate films. The Applied Centura
    iSprint

tm

Tungsten system (iSprint) combines an ALD chamber, which
    deposits a tungsten nucleation film, with a CVD tungsten bulk
    fill process in one system. The iSprint is used to form contact
    structures that connect the transistors to the wiring areas of
    the chip. Applied’s high-k/metal gate



ALD process is part of the Centura Advanced Gate Stack system,
    which enables a single integrated solution for building
    high-k/metal gate structures.

Chemical
    Vapor Deposition

CVD is used to deposit dielectric and metal films on a wafer.
    During the CVD process, gases that contain atoms of the material
    to be deposited react on the wafer surface, forming a thin film
    of solid material. Films deposited by CVD may be silicon oxide,
    single-crystal epitaxial silicon, amorphous silicon, silicon
    nitride, dielectric anti-reflective coatings, low k dielectric
    (for highly efficient insulating materials), aluminum, titanium,
    titanium nitride, polysilicon, tungsten, refractory metals or
    silicides. Applied offers the following CVD products and
    technologies:

The Applied Producer CVD platform

— This
    high-throughput platform features
    Twin-Chamber

®

modules that have two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up
    to three Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer
    platform, giving it a simultaneous processing capacity of six
    wafers. Many dielectric CVD processes can be performed on this
    platform. The highest productivity model of this system is the
    Applied Producer GT, which has achieved rapid customer
    acceptance due to its fast wafer handling performance and
    compact design.

Low k Dielectric Films

— Low k dielectric
    materials are used in copper-based chip designs to further
    improve interconnect speed. Using conventional CVD equipment,
    the Applied Producer Black
    Diamond

®

family of low k systems provides customers with a proven,
    cost-effective way to integrate a variety of low k films into
    advanced interconnect structures. To further increase the
    performance of the complete multi-layer dielectric structure,
    Applied offers a line of
    BLOK

tm

(barrier low k) films deposited with the Producer system.

Lithography-Enabling Solutions

— Applied offers
    several technologies on the Producer system to help chipmakers
    extend their current 193nm lithography tools, including a line
    of Applied
    APF

®

(advanced patterning film) films and Applied
    DARC

®

(dielectric anti-reflective coating) films. Together, they
    provide a film stack with the precise dimensional control and
    compatibility needed to cost-effectively pattern nano-scale
    features without additional integration complexity.

Gap Fill Films

— There are many steps during
    the chipmaking process in which very small and deep, or high
    aspect ratio (HAR), structures must be filled void-free with a
    dielectric film. Many of these applications include the
    deposition of silicon oxides in substrate isolation structures,
    contacts and interconnects. The Applied Centura Ultima
    HDP-CVD

®

(high-density plasma CVD) system has been an industry
    workhorse, providing multi-generational gap-fill capability for
    both logic and memory devices. The Applied Producer HARP (high
    aspect ratio process) provides customers with device scaling
    capability to 32nm and below using

sub-atmospheric

CVD (SACVD) technology enabling the seamless, void-free fill of
    tightly packed HAR structures.

Strain Engineering Solutions

— The Applied
    Producer
    HARP

tm

system also plays a key role in enhancing transistor
    performance, enabling chipmakers to boost chip speed by
    depositing strain-inducing dielectric films. Offering the
    industry’s first integrated stress nitride deposition and
    ultraviolet (UV) cure solution, the Applied Producer Celera CVD
    delivers benchmark levels of high-stress tensile silicon nitride
    films. The Company also offers the Applied Centura SiNgenPlus
    low pressure CVD system for low temperature silicon nitride
    films. Used together, and in conjunction with silicon germanium
    (SiGe) films using Applied’s epitaxial deposition
    technologies, these systems can provide additive strain
    engineering benefits.

Epitaxial Deposition

— Epitaxial silicon
    (epitaxy or epi) is a layer of pure silicon grown in a uniform
    crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high quality base
    for the device circuitry. Epi technology is used in an
    increasing number of integrated circuit devices in both the
    wafer substrate and transistor areas of a chip to enhance speed.
    The Applied Centura Epi system integrates pre- and post-epi
    processes on the same system to improve film quality and reduce
    production costs. This system is also used for SiGe epi
    technology, which reduces power usage and increases speed in
    certain types of advanced chips. For emerging transistor
    designs, the Applied Centura RP Epi system offers selective epi
    processes to enable faster transistor switching through strain
    engineering techniques.



Polysilicon Deposition

— Polysilicon is a type
    of silicon used to form portions of the transistor structure
    within the integrated circuit device. The Applied Centura
    Polygen

tm

LPCVD system is a single-wafer, multi-chamber product that
    deposits thin polysilicon films at high temperatures to create
    transistor gate structures. To address the challenging
    requirements of shrinking gate dimensions, the Applied Centura
    DPN Gate Stack system integrates chambers for decoupled plasma
    nitridation (DPN), RTP anneal and polysilicon deposition on one
    platform to enable superior film quality and material properties.

Tungsten Deposition

— Tungsten is used in the
    contact area of a chip that connects the transistors to the
    wiring circuitry. In aluminum-based devices, tungsten is also
    used in the structures that connect the multiple layers of
    aluminum wiring. Applied has two products for depositing
    tungsten: the Applied Centura
    Sprint

®

Tungsten CVD system for 90nm and below devices and the Applied
    Centura iSprint ALD/CVD system for more advanced applications.
    The latter product combines ALD technology and CVD chambers on
    the same platform.

Physical
    Vapor Deposition

PVD is a physical process in which atoms of a gas, such as
    argon, are accelerated toward a metal target. The metal atoms
    chip off, or sputter away, and are then deposited on the wafer.
    Applied leads the industry in PVD technology with its Applied
    Endura PVD system. This system offers a broad range of advanced
    deposition processes, including aluminum, aluminum alloys,
    cobalt, titanium/titanium nitride, tantalum/tantalum nitride,
    tungsten/tungsten nitride, nickel, vanadium and copper.

The Applied Endura CuBS (copper barrier/seed) PVD system is
    widely used by customers for fabricating copper-based chips.
    Using PVD technology, the system deposits a tantalum-based
    barrier film that prevents copper material from entering other
    areas of the device and then a copper seed layer that primes the
    structure for the subsequent deposition of bulk copper. This
    system also features Activ Pre-clean technology to provide clean
    film interfaces while preserving the k-value integrity of the
    structure. In 2009, the Company introduced the Applied Endura
    CuBS RFX PVD system, extending its cost-effective CuBS
    technology to the 22nm node. Applied’s Endura system has
    also been used for many years in back-end applications to
    deposit metal layers before final bump or wire bonding packaging
    steps are performed. In 2009, the Company introduced a new
    cost-efficient platform specifically designed for under-bump
    metallization (UBM) and other back-end processes. The Applied
    Charger UBM PVD system’s new linear architecture offers
    reliable performance and very high productivity at a low

cost-per-wafer.

Etch

Etching is used many times throughout the integrated circuit
    manufacturing process to selectively remove material from the
    surface of a wafer. Before etching begins, the wafer is coated
    with a light-sensitive film, called photoresist. A
    photolithography process then projects the circuit pattern onto
    the wafer. Etching removes material only from areas dictated by
    the photoresist pattern. Applied offers a wide range of systems
    for etching dielectric, metal and silicon films to meet the
    requirements of

sub-100nm

processing.

For dielectric applications, the Applied Centura
    eMax

®

system etches a broad range of dielectric films in the contact
    and interconnect regions of the chip. Applied’s Producer
    Etch system utilizes the Company’s Twin-Chamber Producer
    platform to target cost-sensitive dielectric etch applications
    in 90nm and below design geometries. To address advanced low k
    etch applications, the Applied Centura
    Enabler

®

Etch system performs etch, strip and clean steps in a single
    chamber. The Enabler’s

all-in-one

capability streamlines the process flow for advanced chip
    designs and significantly reduces operating costs. The Applied
    Centura Carina system uses innovative, high-temperature
    technology to deliver the etch capability essential for scaling
    logic and memory devices with high-k/metal gates at 45nm and
    below.

The Applied Centura
    AdvantEdge

tm

Silicon Etch system offers chipmakers high precision gate
    etching for advanced-generation devices. The Applied Centura
    Mariana Trench Etch system provides customers with the
    capability to scale memory devices by etching 80:1 aspect ratio
    structures. In 2009, the Company introduced the Applied Centura
    Silvia system, specifically designed for etching small, deep
    holes for TSV applications in 3D-ICs. For etching metals, the
    Applied Opus AdvantEdge Metal Etch uses an optimized 5-chamber
    platform configuration



that enables customers to extend aluminum interconnect
    technology and productivity to

sub-70nm

dimensions for flash and DRAM memory applications.

Rapid
    Thermal Processing

RTP is a process in which a wafer is subjected to rapid bursts
    of intense heat that can take the wafer from room temperature to
    more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in less than 10 seconds. A rapid
    thermal process is used mainly for annealing, which modifies the
    properties, of deposited films. The Applied Centura
    Radiance

®

Plus

and Applied Vantage
    RadOx

tm

RTP systems feature advanced RTP technology with differing
    platform designs. While the multi-chamber Centura platform
    offers exceptional process flexibility, the streamlined
    two-chamber Vantage platform is designed for dedicated
    high-volume manufacturing. These single-wafer RTP systems are
    also used for growing high quality oxide and oxynitride films,
    deposition steps that traditional large batch furnaces can no
    longer achieve with the necessary precision and control. With
    its proprietary radical-based oxidation process, the Applied
    Vantage RadOx system deposits high-performance transistor gate
    oxides with high productivity and low operating cost for flash
    memory applications.

Chemical
    Mechanical Planarization

The CMP process removes material from a wafer to create a flat
    (planarized) surface. This process allows subsequent
    photolithography patterning steps to occur with greater accuracy
    and enables film layers to build with minimal height variations.
    Applied has led the industry with its 300mm Applied
    Reflexion

®

LK system, with features such as integrated cleaning, film
    measurement and process control capabilities.

Metrology
    and Wafer Inspection

Applied offers several products for measuring features and
    inspecting defects on the wafer during various stages of the
    fabrication process. These systems enable customers to
    characterize and control critical dimension (CD) and defect
    issues, especially at advanced generation technology nodes.

Critical
    Dimension and Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscopes
    (CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)

Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an electron beam to
    form images of microscopic features of a patterned wafer at
    extremely high magnification. Applied’s SEM products
    provide customers with full automation, along with the high
    accuracy and sensitivity needed for measuring very small CDs.
    The Applied
    VeritySEM

®

Metrology system uses proprietary SEM imaging technology to
    enable precise control of the lithography and etching processes.
    The VeritySEM measures CDs at a precision of less than 3.2
    angstroms, a requirement for 32nm and below device production
    and incorporates automation and software advancements for
    significantly higher throughput. Applied’s OPC
    Check

tm

software for the VeritySEM system performs automated
    qualification of OPC-based (optical proximity correction) chip
    designs, significantly reducing mask (see Mask Making section
    below) verification time over conventional manual methods.

DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (such as particles,
    scratches or residues) that are first located by a defect
    detection system and then classify the defects to identify their
    source. The high-throughput, fully automatic Applied
    SEMVision

tm

Defect Analysis products enable customers to use this technology
    as an integral part of their production lines to analyze defects
    as small as 30nm with industry-leading throughput. The Applied
    SEMVision FIB integrates advanced defect review SEM capability
    with automated focused ion beam (FIB) technology in one system.
    The FIB provides a cross-sectional view of the defects reviewed
    by the SEM, enabling chipmakers to analyze the defects in
    minutes as part of their in-line review process.

Wafer
    Inspection

Using laser-based technology, defects can be detected on
    patterned wafers (wafers with printed circuit images) as they
    move between processing steps. Defects include particles, open
    circuit lines, and shorts between lines. Incorporating key
    advances in imaging technology, the Applied
    ComPlus

tm

Inspection system, for darkfield applications, detects defects
    in devices with design rules of 65nm and below with the high
    speed required for customers’ volume production lines. The
    Applied
    UVision

®

Inspection system is the industry’s first laser-based,



three dimensional brightfield tool. Utilizing multi-beam, deep
    ultraviolet (DUV) laser illumination and high efficiency
    detectors, the UVision system uncovers previously undetectable
    defects on the wafer, enabling customers to rapidly resolve
    defect issues and achieve greater chip yields.

Mask
    Making

Masks are used by photolithography systems to transfer
    microscopic circuit designs onto wafers. Since an imperfection
    in a mask may be replicated on the wafer, the mask must be
    virtually defect-free. Applied provides systems for etching,
    cleaning and inspecting masks.

The Applied Tetra
    III

tm

Advanced Reticle Etch system, an advanced etch tool for
    fabricating leading-edge masks, is used by virtually every
    advanced mask maker in the world for 45nm photomask development
    and production. The groundbreaking Applied
    Aera2

tm

Mask Inspection system allows customers to meet the most
    critical defect detection challenges of advanced masks. Using
    sophisticated aerial imaging technology, the Aera2 is the first
    mask inspection system that allows users to immediately see how
    the pattern on the mask will appear on the wafer, revealing only
    the defects most likely to print and significantly reducing
    inspection time.

    life of 200mm semiconductor fabs, including new and
    remanufactured 200mm equipment, system enhancements and fab
    transition services. Designed to maximize productivity and lower
    cost of ownership, these products also assist customers in
    implementing green manufacturing solutions. Applied’s 200mm
    systems are available in a broad range of production-proven
    technologies, including CVD, PVD, etch, implant, RTP, CMP,
    epitaxy, metrology and inspection tools.

Automation Systems

— Applied offers automated
    factory-level and tool-level control software systems for
    semiconductor, LCD and solar cell manufacturing facilities.
    These enterprise solutions include manufacturing execution
    systems (MES) to automate the production of wafers and LCD and
    solar substrates, advanced process control systems, and
    scheduling and materials handling control systems. Applied also
    offers computerized maintenance management systems, performance
    tracking, and modeling and simulation tools for improving asset
    utilization. Applied’s breakthrough E3 equipment
    engineering system solution, for example, uniquely integrates
    all critical equipment automation and process control
    components. In 2009, the Company introduced its Applied
    SmartMove system, enabling wireless wafer management in
    non-automated 200mm and 300mm fabs.



Abatement Systems

— Applied’s family of
    Metron abatement systems is a comprehensive line of
    environmental solutions for the semiconductor, solar and display
    industries. These systems include a wide range of

point-of-use

scrubbing tools such as wet, dry, thermal and integrated
    technologies for reliable, cost-effective abatement of exhaust
    gases. Applied’s Marathon Series, for example, offers smart
    abatement technology that specifically targets perfluorocarbon
    effluents from processing systems.

Display
    Segment

Applied’s AKT subsidiary, reported under the Display
    segment, designs, manufactures and sells equipment to fabricate
    thin film transistor LCDs for televisions, computer displays and
    other consumer-oriented electronic applications. While
    similarities exist between the technologies utilized in
    chipmaking and LCD fabrication, the most significant differences
    are in the size and composition of the substrate. Substrates
    used to manufacture LCD panels can be more than 70 times larger
    in area than 300mm wafers and are made of glass, while wafers
    are made of silicon. This technology for deposition on
    large-size substrates is also used in the Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line.

Applied supplies a wide range of systems that process and test
    different glass substrate sizes. For fabricating the transistor
    layer of these panels, the Company offers a line of
    plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) systems that use multi-chamber
    platform architecture to deposit dielectric and semiconducting
    films. The
    AKT-PiVot

tm

55KV system employs high-productivity, cost-efficient PVD
    technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide
    films on the substrate. For manufacturing the color filter of
    LCD panels, Applied offers the AKT-NEW
    ARISTO

tm

for transparent conductive oxide film deposition.

To complement these systems, Applied also offers a line of
    electron beam test (EBT) systems for testing substrates during
    production for defective pixels and other imperfections.
    Featuring one of the industry’s fastest and most accurate
    pixel test technologies with the lowest operating cost, the EBT
    systems’ non-contact test technology enables the safe
    testing of high-value LCD TV panels without damaging or
    scratching the display.

To meet growing consumer demand for larger, more cost-efficient
    LCD TVs, LCD manufacturers have moved to increasingly
    larger-sized substrates. Applied’s latest generation (Gen)
    10 systems can process substrates sized at approximately 2.85 x
    3.05 meters, with each substrate enabling the production of up
    to six

65-inch

LCD
    TV screens. These Gen-10 systems include the AKT-90K PECVD and
    the Gen-10 AKT-90K EBT products.

Energy
    and Environmental Solutions Segment

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes
    manufacturing solutions for the generation and conservation of
    energy. Applied entered the solar PV market in 2006, announcing
    its objective to lower the overall cost per watt of solar
    electricity to parity with that of electricity generated by
    other sources such as the burning of fossil fuels. Applied
    offers manufacturing solutions for both wafer-based crystalline
    silicon (c-Si) and glass-based thin film applications to enable
    customers to increase the conversion efficiency and yields of
    solar PV devices.

Applied’s extensive portfolio of solar PV cell fabrication
    technologies has made it the leading supplier of c-Si
    manufacturing systems worldwide. Key benefits of these systems
    are high-productivity, advanced ultra-thin wafer handling, and
    extensive automation, helping customers to lower the cost per
    watt. Applied offers a comprehensive line of automated
    metallization and test systems for c-Si cell manufacturing. In
    2009, the Company introduced its Baccini
    Esatto

tm

Technology, a high precision, multi-step printing capability
    designed to increase the efficiency of c-Si solar cells. Applied
    also offers systems for slicing and squaring wafers from silicon
    ingots. In 2009, the Company introduced its Applied HCT
    MaxEdge

tm

wire saw, featuring the industry’s first dual-wire
    management system for slicing ultra-thin wafers. Applied also
    introduced the HCT Diamond
    Squarer

tm

system with novel diamond wire technology that eliminates the
    need for abrasive slurry and significantly cuts electricity
    consumption.

For thin film applications, Applied developed the Applied SunFab
    Thin Film Line, which is the world’s only integrated glass-
    in/panel-out production line for manufacturing thin film silicon
    solar modules using 5.7 square meter
    (m


)

    glass substrates. These ultra-large panels, which are
    approximately four times the size of thin film solar panels
    offered by others in the industry, are intended for large-scale
    applications such as solar farms, utilities and
    building-integrated solar PV system installations. Applied has
    entered into multiple contracts for its SunFab line with
    customers in Europe, Asia and Saudi Arabia. Several of these
    lines have passed final acceptance testing, and



customers have begun volume manufacturing of SunFab modules.
    SunFab modules have met the stringent requirements of the
    International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), certifying that
    these modules will meet performance and safety specifications
    under challenging environmental conditions. In 2009, Applied
    announced its second-generation SunFab technology that enables
    customers to achieve a 22% reduction in materials cost.

Products in this segment also include the
    ATON

tm

in-line deposition system, a large-area platform for
    high-quality deposition and high-throughput in both c-Si and
    thin film solar PV cell manufacturing, as well as processes,
    materials-handling technologies and fabrication services. Other
    products include

roll-to-roll,

vacuum web coating systems for high-performance deposition of a
    range of films on flexible substrates for functional, aesthetic
    or optical properties. In 2009, the Company shipped its new
    Applied Topmet 4450, the world’s largest and fastest

roll-to-roll

machine that deposits ultra-thin aluminum films for flexible
    packaging applications on 4.5m wide rolls of substrate material
    at 20 meters per second. Applied also offers large-area
    deposition equipment for the production of low-emissivity
    (low-E) and solar control architectural glass.

Backlog

Applied manufactures systems to meet demand represented by order
    backlog and customer commitments. Backlog consists of:
    (1) orders for which written authorizations have been
    accepted and assigned shipment dates are within the next
    12 months, or shipment has occurred but revenue has not
    been recognized; (2) contractual service revenue and
    maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months;
    and (3) orders for SunFab lines that are anticipated to be
    recognized as revenue within the next 12 months.

Applied’s backlog decreased from $4.8 billion at
    October 26, 2008 to $2.7 billion at October 25,
    2009. Applied’s backlog on any particular date is not
    necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding
    period. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel
    orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation
    penalties. Backlog adjustments were negative for fiscal 2009 and
    totaled $1.2 billion, consisting primarily of customer
    cancellations and financial debookings, reflecting the decline
    in demand for semiconductor equipment. Delays in delivery
    schedules

and/or

a
    reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a
    material adverse effect on Applied’s business and results
    of operations.

Manufacturing,
    Raw Materials and Supplies

Applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of
    procurement, assembly, test and integration of various
    proprietary and commercial parts, components and subassemblies
    (collectively, parts) that are used to manufacture systems.
    Products in the Silicon segment are manufactured in Austin,
    Texas and Rehovot, Israel. Remanufactured products in the
    Applied Global Services segment are produced primarily in
    Austin, Texas. Products in the Display segment are manufactured
    in Santa Clara, California; Alzenau, Germany; and Tainan,
    Taiwan. Products in the Energy and Environmental Solutions
    segment are manufactured primarily in Alzenau, Germany;
    Cheseaux, Switzerland; Treviso, Italy; and Santa Clara,
    California. Manufacturing requires raw materials, including a
    wide variety of mechanical and electrical components, to be
    manufactured to Applied’s specifications. Applied uses
    numerous companies, including contract manufacturers, to supply
    parts for the manufacture and support of its products. Although
    Applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts are
    available from multiple qualified suppliers, this is not always
    possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be obtained from only
    a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Applied seeks
    to reduce costs and to lower the risks of production and service
    interruptions, as well as shortages of key parts, by:
    (1) selecting and qualifying alternate suppliers for key
    parts; (2) monitoring the financial condition of key
    suppliers; (3) maintaining appropriate inventories of key
    parts; (4) qualifying new parts on a timely basis; and
    (5) locating certain manufacturing operations in areas that
    are closer to suppliers and customers.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s long-term growth strategy requires continued
    development of new products. Applied’s significant
    investment in research, development and engineering (RD&E)
    has generally enabled it to deliver new products and
    technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus
    allowing customers to incorporate these products into their
    manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology
    selection cycle. Applied works closely with its global



customers to design systems and processes that meet their
    planned technical and production requirements. Product
    development and engineering organizations are located primarily
    in the United States, as well as in Europe, Israel and China. In
    addition, Applied outsources certain RD&E activities, some
    of which are performed outside the United States. Process
    support and customer demonstration laboratories are located in
    the United States, China, Europe and Israel.

Applied’s investments in RD&E for product development
    and engineering programs to create or improve products and
    technologies over the last three years were as follows:
    $934 million (19 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2009,
    $1.1 billion (14 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2008
    and $1.1 billion (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal
    2007. Applied has spent an average of 14 percent of net
    sales in RD&E over the last five years. In addition to
    RD&E for specific product technologies, Applied maintains
    ongoing programs for automation control systems, materials
    research and environmental control that are applicable to its
    products. In fiscal 2009, Applied focused on developing systems
    for semiconductor customers’ new chip designs with 32nm and
    below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors
    using strain engineering and high-k/metal gate technologies, as
    well as double patterning processes that allows customers to
    extend their existing 193nm lithography tools through additional
    technology generations. Applied also focused on developing
    technology for through-silicon vias, an emerging solution for
    interconnecting three dimensional chip stacks to provide better
    device performance, lower power consumption and the integration
    of heterogeneous devices. RD&E also included activities to
    develop products that enable lower-cost production of solar
    energy and other products to enable energy conservation.

Marketing
    and Sales

Because of the highly technical nature of its products, Applied
    markets and sells products worldwide through a direct sales
    force. Approximately 81 percent of Applied’s fiscal
    2009 net sales were to regions outside of the
    United States. Net sales to customers by region as a
    percentage of total net sales were: Taiwan 21 percent,
    North America (primarily the United States) 19 percent,
    Asia-Pacific (including China) 18 percent, Europe
    15 percent, Japan 14 percent, and Korea
    13 percent.

General economic conditions impact Applied’s business and
    financial results. From time to time, the markets in which
    products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may
    negatively impact sales. Applied’s business is usually not
    seasonal in nature, but it is cyclical, based on capital
    equipment investment by major semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar PV and other manufacturers. These expenditures depend on
    many factors, including: anticipated market demand and pricing
    for semiconductors, LCDs, solar cells and modules, architectural
    glass and other substrates; the development of new technologies;
    customers’ factory utilization; capital resources and
    financing; and global and regional economic conditions.

Applied manages its business and reports financial results based
    on the segments described above, but does not allocate certain
    sales and marketing costs to the segments.

Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and
    long-lived assets attributable to Applied’s geographic
    regions is included in Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements. In fiscal 2009, Intel Corporation
    accounted for 12 percent of Applied’s net sales.
    Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. accounted for 10 percent of
    Applied’s net sales in fiscal 2009, 16 percent of net
    sales in fiscal 2008, and 12 percent of net sales in fiscal
    2007. These net sales were for products in multiple reportable
    segments.

Competition

The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive
    and characterized by rapid technological change. Applied’s
    ability to compete generally depends on its ability to timely
    commercialize its technology, continually improve its products
    and develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer
    requirements. Significant competitive factors include technical
    capability and differentiation, productivity and
    cost-effectiveness. The importance of these factors varies
    according to customers’ needs, including product mix and
    respective product requirements, applications, and the timing
    and circumstances of purchasing decisions. Substantial
    competition exists in all areas of Applied’s business.
    Competitors range from small companies that compete with a
    single product

and/or

in a
    single region, to global, diversified companies with a range of
    products. Applied’s ability to



compete requires a high level of investment in RD&E,
    marketing and sales and global customer support activities.
    Management believes that many of Applied’s products have
    strong competitive positions.

The competitive environment for each segment is described below:

The semiconductor industry has been increasingly driven by
    consumer demand for lower-cost electronic products with
    increased capability and, to a lesser extent, by demand for
    commercial applications. As a result, products within the
    Silicon segment are subject to rapid changes in customer
    requirements, including transitions to smaller dimensions, new
    materials and an increasing number of applications. While
    certain existing technologies may be adapted to new
    requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely
    different technical approach. The rapid pace of technological
    change can quickly diminish the value of current technologies
    and products and create opportunities for existing and new
    competitors. Applied offers a broad portfolio of technically
    differentiated products that must continuously evolve to satisfy
    customers’ requirements in order to compete effectively.
    Applied allocates resources among its many product offerings and
    therefore may decide not to invest in an individual product to
    the same degree as competitors who specialize in fewer products.
    There are many competitors serving the semiconductor
    manufacturing equipment industry, with some offering a single
    product line and others offering multiple product lines. These
    competitors range from suppliers serving a single region to
    global, diversified companies.

Products and services within the Applied Global Services segment
    are characterized by demanding worldwide service requirements
    and a diverse group of numerous competitors. To compete
    effectively, Applied offers products and services to reduce
    costs, improve productivity, and lessen the environmental impact
    of customers’ fab operations. Significant competitive
    factors include productivity, cost-effectiveness, and the level
    of technical service and support. The importance of these
    factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type
    of products or services offered.

Products in the Display segment are subject to strong
    competition from a number of major competitors. Applied holds
    established market positions with its technically differentiated
    thin film technology (TFT)-LCD manufacturing solutions for
    PECVD, color filter PVD and TFT array testing, although its
    market position could change quickly due to customers’
    evolving requirements. In fiscal 2007, Applied entered the array
    PVD market with the
    AKT-PiVot

tm

55KV PVD system. Applied faces significant competition from
    existing array PVD suppliers.

Applied’s products within the Energy and Environmental
    Solutions segment compete in diverse market areas, including
    equipment to make solar PV cells and modules, flexible
    electronics and energy-efficient glass. In solar, Applied offers
    products for two distinct technologies, c-Si wafer-based and
    thin film glass-based applications. As a recent entrant to the
    solar equipment business, Applied competes with many other
    companies that have more experience with solar applications.
    Applied also is a recent entrant to the flexible electronics
    equipment business, which operates in an emerging market sector
    characterized by diverse types of applications, customer
    requirements and competitors. Applied’s glass coating
    equipment faces significant competition from at least one
    established supplier and another recent market entrant.

Patents
    and Licenses

Management believes that Applied’s competitive position
    significantly depends upon the Company’s research,
    development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing
    capabilities, and not just on its patent position. However,
    protection of Applied’s technological assets through
    enforcement of its intellectual property rights, including
    patents, is important. Therefore, Applied’s practice is to
    file patent applications in the United States and other
    countries for inventions that Applied considers significant.
    Applied has a substantial number of patents in the United States
    and other countries, and additional applications are pending for
    new inventions. Although Applied does not consider its business
    materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Applied
    and the products made and sold under its patents, taken as a
    whole, are a significant element of Applied’s business. In
    addition to patents, Applied also possesses other intellectual
    property, including trademarks, know-how, trade secrets and
    copyrights.



Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements
    with other companies when management determines that it is in
    the Company’s best interest to do so. Applied pays
    royalties under existing patent license agreements for the use,
    in several of its products, of certain patented technologies
    that are licensed to Applied for the life of the patents.
    Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted to third
    parties. Royalties received from or paid to third parties have
    not been, and are not expected to be, material to Applied’s
    consolidated results of operations.

In the normal course of business, Applied periodically receives
    and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In
    dealing with such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful
    for Applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights.
    However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights
    will be available to Applied on commercially reasonable terms,
    or at all. If Applied is not able to resolve or settle claims,
    obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms,

and/or

successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Environmental
    Matters

Two of Applied’s locations have been designated as
    environmental cleanup sites. In 1987, the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency designated one of the locations,
    in Santa Clara, California, as a Superfund site and named
    Applied as a “Responsible Party.” Cleanup activities
    at this site began in 1984 and were substantially completed in
    February 2002, and present activities consist of annual sampling
    of wells. The California Regional Water Quality Control Board
    designated Applied as a “Discharger” with respect to
    another site in Sunnyvale, California. Applied was named a
    Discharger upon its acquisition of the property in 1997 solely
    due to its status as property owner. The prior owners of the
    site

and/or

operators who caused the contamination are responsible for
    performing cleanup and monitoring activities.

Applied maintains a number of environmental, health and safety
    programs that are primarily preventive in nature. As part of
    these programs, Applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance
    and periodically conducts investigations of possible
    contamination.

Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating
    the discharge of materials into the environment, remedial
    agreements and other actions relating to the environment have
    not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on
    Applied’s capital expenditures, competitive position,
    financial condition or results of operations.

The most recent report on Applied’s environmental, health
    and safety activities can be found in the Company’s
    Citizenship Report on its website at

http://www.appliedmaterials.com/about/environment.html.

Employees

At October 25, 2009, Applied employed 12,619 regular
    employees and 413 temporary employees. In the high-technology
    industry, competition for highly-skilled employees is intense.
    Applied believes that its future success is highly dependent
    upon its continued ability to attract, retain and motivate
    qualified employees. There can be no assurance that Applied will
    be able to attract, hire, assimilate, motivate and retain a
    sufficient number of qualified employees.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

The following factors could materially affect Applied’s
    business, financial condition or results of operations and
    should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its
    business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere
    in this report.

The
    industries that Applied serves are volatile and difficult to
    predict.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar and related industries, Applied is subject to business
    cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be
    difficult to predict and which vary by reportable segment. These
    industries historically have been cyclical due to sudden changes
    in customers’ manufacturing capacity requirements and
    spending, which depend in part on customers’ capacity
    utilization, production volumes, end-use demand, inventory
    levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital.
    These changes have affected the timing and amounts of
    customers’ purchases and investments in technology, and
    continue to affect Applied’s orders, net sales, operating
    expenses and net income.

To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves,
    Applied must effectively manage its resources and production
    capacity for each of its segments as well as across multiple
    segments. The challenging economic and industry conditions have
    adversely affected Applied’s customers and led to a
    significant decrease in demand for many of Applied’s
    products, although indications of improving conditions are
    beginning to appear. During periods of increasing demand for its
    products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity
    and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its
    supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number
    of qualified individuals; and continue to control costs. During
    periods of decreasing demand, Applied must be able to
    appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market
    conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate
    and retain key employees. If Applied is not able to timely and
    appropriately adapt to changes in its business environment,
    Applied’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with the difficult financial
    markets and weak global economy.

The tightening of the credit markets, disruption in the
    financial markets, and global economic downturn experienced over
    the last several quarters contributed to significant slowdowns
    in the industries in which Applied operates, which slowdowns may
    persist or worsen if these economic conditions are prolonged or
    deteriorate further. The markets for semiconductors and flat
    panel displays in particular depend largely on consumer
    spending. Economic uncertainty exacerbates negative trends in
    consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to
    push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment
    or services, which may reduce net sales, reduce backlog, and
    affect Applied’s ability to convert backlog to sales.
    Difficulties in obtaining capital and uncertain market
    conditions may also lead to the inability of some customers to
    obtain affordable financing and to customer insolvencies,
    resulting in lower sales

and/or

additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. These
    conditions may also similarly affect key suppliers, which could
    impair their ability to deliver parts and result in delays for
    Applied’s products. In addition, these conditions may lead
    to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment
    manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s
    ability to compete effectively.

Further, these adverse conditions and uncertainty about future
    economic and industry conditions make it challenging for Applied
    to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and
    identify the risks that may affect its business, sources and
    uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations.
    Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction
    efforts, including restructuring activities,

and/or

modify its business model, which may adversely affect
    Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities in a
    market recovery. In addition, Applied maintains an investment
    portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, foreign
    exchange, market and interest rate risks and that also includes
    some exposure to asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities.
    The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be
    exacerbated by deteriorating financial market conditions and, as
    a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio
    could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. If
    Applied is not able to timely and appropriately adapt to changes
    resulting from the difficult macroeconomic environment and
    industry conditions, Applied’s business, financial
    condition or results of operations may be materially and
    adversely affected.



Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the
    various industries in which it operates.

The global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar and related
    industries in which Applied operates are characterized by
    ongoing changes affecting some or all of these industries,
    including:

•

increasing capital requirements for building and operating new
    fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the
    necessary capital, particularly in a difficult financial market;

•

differences in growth rates among the semiconductor, display and
    solar industries;

•

abrupt and unforeseen shifts in the nature and amount of
    customer and end-user demand;

•

the increasing cost and complexity for customers to move from
    product design to volume manufacturing, which may slow the
    adoption rate for new manufacturing technology;

•

the importance of reducing the total cost of manufacturing
    system ownership, due in part to greater demand for lower-cost
    consumer electronics as compared to business information
    technology spending;

•

the heightened importance to customers of system reliability and
    productivity and the effect on demand for fabrication systems as
    a result of their increasing productivity, device yield and
    reliability;

•

increased need to develop products with sufficient
    differentiation to influence customers’ purchasing
    decisions;

•

requirements for shorter cycle times for the development,
    manufacture and installation of manufacturing equipment;

•

price and performance trends for semiconductor devices, LCDs and
    solar PVs, and the corresponding effect on demand for such
    products;

•

the increasing importance of the availability of spare parts to
    maximize the time that customers’ systems are available for
    production;

•

the increasing role for and complexity of software in Applied
    products; and

•

the increasing focus on reducing energy usage and improving the
    environmental impact and sustainability associated with
    manufacturing operations.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes in the semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar and related industries, its business, financial condition
    and results of operations could be materially and adversely
    affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to
    the semiconductor industry.

The greatest portion of Applied’s revenues and
    profitability historically has been derived from sales of
    manufacturing equipment to the global semiconductor industry. In
    addition, a majority of the revenues of Applied Global Services
    is from sales of service products to semiconductor
    manufacturers. The semiconductor industry is characterized by
    ongoing changes particular to that industry, in addition to the
    general industry changes described in the preceding risk factor,
    which may result in decreased spending by customers and
    negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and
    results of operations. The changes include:

•

the increasing cost of research and development due to many
    factors, including: decreasing linewidths on a chip; the use of
    new materials such as cobalt and yttrium; more complex device
    structures; more applications and process steps; increasing chip
    design costs; and the increasing cost and complexity of an
    integrated manufacturing process;

•

the growing number of types and varieties of semiconductors and
    number of applications across multiple substrate sizes;

•

differing market growth rates and capital requirements for
    different applications, such as memory (including NAND flash and
    DRAM), logic and foundry, and Applied’s ability to compete
    in these market segments;



•

the increasing cost and complexity for semiconductor
    manufacturers to move more technically advanced capability and
    smaller linewidths to volume manufacturing, and the resulting
    impact on the rates of technology transition and investment in
    capital equipment;

•

semiconductor manufacturers’ increasing adoption of more
    productive 300mm systems and reductions in 200mm system
    capacity, and the resulting effect on demand for manufacturing
    equipment and services;

•

the decreasing rate of capital expenditures as a percentage of
    semiconductor manufacturers’ revenue;

•

the decreasing profitability of many semiconductor
    manufacturers, causing them to enter into collaboration or
    cost-sharing arrangements with other manufacturers, outsource
    manufacturing activities, focus only on specific markets or
    applications,

and/or

purchase less manufacturing equipment, which puts downward
    pressure on sales prices for, and the rate of investment in,
    capital equipment;

•

technology developments in related markets, such as lithography,
    to which Applied may need to adapt;

•

competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance market
    position, especially in larger market segments such as etch;

•

the increasing market fragmentation for semiconductors, leading
    certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new
    fabrication plant; and

•

the cost, technical complexity and timing of a proposed
    transition from 300mm to 450mm wafers.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes occurring in the semiconductor industry, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to
    the flat panel display industry.

The global flat panel display industry historically has
    experienced considerable volatility in capital equipment
    investment levels, due in part to the limited number of LCD
    manufacturers and the concentrated nature of LCD end-use
    applications. Recently, industry growth has depended to a
    considerable extent on consumer demand for increasingly larger
    and more advanced TVs. In addition to the general industry
    changes described above in the third risk factor, the display
    industry is characterized by ongoing changes particular to that
    industry, including:

•

technical and financial difficulties associated with
    transitioning to larger substrate sizes for LCDs;

•

the effect of a slowing rate of transition to larger substrate
    sizes on capital intensity and product differentiation;

•

new energy efficiency standards for large-screen LCD TVs
    ; and

•

uncertainty with respect to future LCD technology end-use
    applications and growth drivers.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes occurring in the display industry, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to
    the solar industry.

Applied anticipates that an increasing portion of its business
    will be in the emerging solar market, which, in addition to the
    general industry changes described above in the third risk
    factor, is characterized by ongoing changes specific to the
    solar industry, including:

•

the impact on demand for solar PV products arising from the cost
    and performance of solar PV technology compared to the cost of
    electricity from the existing grid or other energy sources;

•

the critical role played by energy policies of governments
    around the world in influencing the rate of growth of the solar
    market including the availability and amount of government
    incentives for solar power such as tax credits, rebates,
    renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers
    to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and
    goals for solar installations on government facilities;



•

changes in the nature and amount of end demand for solar PVs
    that adversely impact the profitability and growth rates of
    Applied’s products;

•

the extent of investment or participation in the solar market by
    utilities that generate, transmit or distribute power to
    end-users;

•

evolving industry standards, such as a standard form factor for
    thin film solar modules;

•

varying levels of infrastructure investment for “smart
    grid” technologies to modernize and enhance the
    transmission, distribution and use of electricity, which link
    distributed solar PV sources to population centers, increase
    transmission capability, and optimize power usage;

•

regulatory and third party certification requirements, and
    customers’ ability to timely satisfy such requirements;

•

the increasing rates of production of solar PVs in China;

•

access to affordable financing and capital by customers and
    end-users; and

•

increasingly greater factory output and scalability of solar PVs.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to
    competition and rapid technological changes.

As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment, its
    future success depends on many factors, including the effective
    commercialization and customer acceptance of its
    nanomanufacturing technology equipment, service and related
    products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its
    growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing
    markets, expanding into related markets, cultivating new markets
    and exceeding industry growth rates, while constantly improving
    its operational performance. The development, introduction and
    support of a broadening set of products in more varied
    competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and
    expensive over time. Furthermore, new or improved products may
    entail higher costs and reduced profits. Applied’s success
    is subject to many risks, including but not limited to its
    ability to timely, cost-effectively and successfully:

•

develop new products, improve

and/or

develop new applications for existing products, and adapt
    similar products for use by customers in different applications

and/or

markets with varying technical requirements;

•

appropriately price and achieve market acceptance of products;

•

differentiate its products from those of competitors and any
    disruptive technologies, meet performance specifications, and
    drive efficiencies and cost reductions;

•

maintain operating flexibility to enable different responses to
    different markets, customers and applications;

•

grow the profitability and market acceptance of its thin film
    solar products;

•

allocate resources, including people and R&D funding, among
    Applied’s products and between the development of new
    products and the enhancement of existing products, as most
    appropriate and effective for future growth;

•

accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet
    production schedules for its products;

•

improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost
    efficiencies across product offerings;

•

adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different
    parts of the supply chain;

•

qualify products for volume manufacturing with its customers;



•

implement changes in its design engineering methodology,
    including those that enable reduction of material costs and
    cycle time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts
    used in different systems, greater effectiveness of product life
    cycle management, and reduced energy usage and environmental
    impact; and

•

accomplish the simultaneous

start-up

of
    multiple integrated thin film solar production lines.

If Applied does not successfully manage these challenges, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Operating
    in multiple industries and the entry into new markets and
    industries entail additional challenges.

As part of its growth strategy, Applied must successfully expand
    into related or new markets and industries, either with its
    existing nanomanufacturing technology products or with new
    products developed internally or obtained through acquisitions.
    The entry into different markets involves additional challenges,
    including those arising from:

•

the need to devote additional resources to develop new products
    for, and operate in, new markets;

•

differing rates of profitability and growth among its multiple
    businesses;

•

Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on
    opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;

•

the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations
    in production planning, execution, supply chain management and
    logistics;

•

the adoption of new business models, such as the supply of an
    integrated production line consisting of a suite of Applied and
    non-Applied equipment to manufacture solar PVs;

•

the need to undertake activities to grow demand for end-products;

•

the need to develop adequate new business processes and systems;

•

Applied’s ability to rapidly expand its operations to meet
    increased demand and the associated effect on working capital;

•

new materials, processes and technologies;

•

the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills
    and expertise in these new areas;

•

new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some
    with limited operating histories, uncertain

and/or

limited funding, evolving business models

and/or

locations in regions where Applied does not have existing
    operations;

•

different customer service requirements;

•

new

and/or

different competitors with potentially more financial or other
    resources and industry experience;

•

entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels
    of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business,
    employment and safety practices;

•

third parties’ intellectual property rights; and

•

the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry
    standards and practices.

If Applied does not successfully manage the risks resulting from
    its diversification and entry into new markets and industries,
    its business, financial condition and results of operations
    could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to the risks of operating a global
    business.

In fiscal 2009, approximately 81 percent of Applied’s
    net sales were to customers in regions outside the
    United States. Certain of Applied’s R&D

and/or

manufacturing facilities, as well as suppliers to Applied, are
    also located outside the United States, including in China.
    Applied is also expanding its business and operations in new



countries. The global nature of Applied’s business and
    operations presents challenges, including but not limited to
    those arising from:

•

varying regional and geopolitical business conditions and
    demands;

•

changes in political and social attitudes, laws, rules,
    regulations and policies to favor domestic companies over
    non-domestic companies;

•

variations among, and changes in, local, regional, national or
    international laws and regulations (including tax and import
    /export restrictions), as well as the interpretation and
    application of such laws and regulations;

•

global trade issues, including those related to the
    interpretation and application of import and export licenses;

•

variations in protection of intellectual property and other
    legal rights;

•

positions taken by U.S. governmental agencies regarding
    possible national commercial

and/or

security issues posed by international business operations;

•

fluctuating raw material and energy costs;

•

variations in the ability to develop relationships with
    suppliers and other local businesses;

•

fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates,
    including the relative strength or weakness of the
    U.S. dollar;

•

the need to provide sufficient levels of technical support in
    different locations;

•

political instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes,
    floods or storms), pandemics, terrorism or acts of war in
    locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales;

•

cultural differences;

•

customer- or government-supported efforts to promote the
    development and growth of local competitors;

•

shipping costs

and/or

delays;

•

the need to continually improve the Company’s operating
    cost structure;

•

difficulties and uncertainties associated with the entry into
    new countries;

•

uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various
    countries; and

•

uncertainties with respect to growth rates for the manufacture
    and sales of semiconductors, LCDs and solar PVs in the
    developing economies of certain countries.

Many of these challenges are present in China, which is
    experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and
    competitors to Applied. Applied further believes that China
    presents a large potential market for its products and
    opportunity for growth over the long term, although at lower
    projected levels of profitability and margins than historically
    have been achieved in other regions. In addition, Applied must
    regularly reassess the size, capability and location of its
    global infrastructure and make appropriate changes, and must
    have effective change management processes and procedures to
    address changes in its business and operations. These challenges
    may materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated
    customer base.

Applied’s semiconductor and flat panel display customer
    bases historically have been, and are becoming even more, highly
    concentrated as a result of industry conditions. These
    conditions are also adversely affecting customers’
    profitability and access to capital, which leads to lower
    R&D funding and capital expenditures. In addition, certain
    customers have entered into strategic alliances or industry
    consortia that have increased the influence of key industry
    participants in technology decisions made by their partners. In
    the solar area, while the number of solar PV manufacturing
    customers increases as the number of market entrants grows, the
    size of contracts with particular customers is expected to rise
    substantially as the industry moves to greater solar module



factory output capacity. The ongoing adverse conditions in the
    credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns have caused,
    and may continue to cause, some customers to postpone delivery,
    reduce or cancel orders, exit businesses, merge with other
    manufacturers or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially
    cease operations. In this environment, contracts or orders from
    a relatively limited number of semiconductor, display and solar
    manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue
    to account for, a substantial portion of Applied’s
    business. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales
    to any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter and from year to year. If customers do not place orders,
    or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied
    may not be able to replace the business. As Applied’s
    products are configured to customer specifications, changing,
    rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant,
    non-recoverable costs. Major customers may also seek, and on
    occasion receive, pricing, payment, intellectual
    property-related, or other commercial terms that are less
    favorable to Applied. In addition, certain customers have
    undergone significant ownership

and/or

management changes, outsourced manufacturing activities, engaged
    in collaboration or cooperation arrangements with other
    customers, or consolidated with other customers, each of which
    may result in additional complexities in managing customer
    relationships and transactions, as well as cancelled or
    decreased orders and lower net sales. These factors could have a
    material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic
    investments.

Applied has made, and in the future intends to make,
    acquisitions of, and investments in, companies, technologies or
    products in existing, related or new markets for Applied.
    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited
    to:

•

diversion of management’s attention from other operational
    matters;

•

inability to complete acquisitions as anticipated or at all;

•

inability to realize anticipated benefits;

•

failure to commercialize purchased technologies;

•

inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that
    may be significantly different from Applied’s existing
    markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions;

•

failure to attract, retain and motivate key employees from the
    acquired business;

•

exposure to operational risks, rules and regulations to the
    extent such activities are located in countries where Applied
    has not historically conducted business;

•

challenges associated with managing larger, more diverse and
    more widespread operations;

•

inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in
    key technologies;

•

inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s
    internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures,

and/or

environmental, health & safety, human resource, or
    other policies;

•

impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of
    technological advancements or

worse-than-expected

performance of the acquired company or its product offerings;

•

the risk of litigation or disputes with customers, suppliers,
    partners or stockholders of an acquisition target arising from a
    proposed or completed transaction;

•

unknown, underestimated

and/or

undisclosed commitments or liabilities;

•

inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical
    resources or facilities for business needs; and

•

ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies,
    products or employees of an acquired business.

Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies,
    including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline
    in value

and/or

not
    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments
    depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited
    or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures,
    requires



ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The
    risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be
    exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic
    conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment
    portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment
    charges. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are
    inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to
    effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely
    affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results
    of operations. If Applied does not successfully manage the risks
    associated with acquisitions and strategic investments, its
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Manufacturing
    interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to
    meet customer demand, while the failure to estimate customer
    demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete
    inventory.

Applied’s business depends on its ability to timely supply
    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly
    changing technical and volume requirements of its customers,
    which depends in part on the timely delivery of parts,
    components and subassemblies (collectively, parts) from
    suppliers. Some key parts may be subject to long lead-times

and/or

obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of
    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by
    suppliers located in countries other than the United States,
    including China. Further, the ongoing adverse conditions in the
    credit and financial markets and industry slowdowns have caused,
    and may continue to cause, some suppliers to scale back
    operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file
    for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations,
    potentially affecting Applied’s ability to obtain parts.
    Applied may experience significant interruptions of its
    manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver
    products or services, increased costs or customer order
    cancellations as a result of:

•

the failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver quality
    parts;

•

volatility in the availability and cost of materials;

•

difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export
    approvals;

•

information technology or infrastructure failures;

•

natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or
    storms); or

•

other causes (such as regional economic downturns, pandemics,
    political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) that could
    result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing inefficiencies,
    increased costs or order cancellations.

In addition, Applied’s need to rapidly increase its
    business and manufacturing capacity to meet increases in demand
    or expedited shipment schedules may exacerbate any interruptions
    in Applied’s manufacturing operations and supply chain and
    the associated effect on Applied’s working capital.
    Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is
    different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts
    than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or
    expediting delivery of parts. The volatility of demand for
    capital equipment increases capital, technical and other risks
    for companies in the supply chain. Any or all of these factors
    could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

The
    failure to successfully implement and conduct off-shoring and
    outsourcing activities and other operational initiatives could
    adversely affect results of operations.

To better align its costs with market conditions, increase its
    presence in growing markets, enhance productivity, and improve
    efficiencies, Applied conducts engineering, software development
    and other operations in regions outside the United States,
    particularly India and China, and outsources certain functions
    to third parties, including companies in the United States,
    India, China and other countries. Outsourced functions include
    certain engineering, manufacturing, customer support, software
    development, information technology support, finance and
    administrative activities. The expanding role of third party
    providers has required changes to Applied’s existing
    operations and the adoption of new procedures and processes for
    retaining and managing these providers, as well as
    redistributing responsibilities as warranted, in order to
    realize the potential productivity and operational efficiencies,
    assure quality and continuity of supply, and protect
    Applied’s intellectual property. In addition, Applied has
    implemented several key operational initiatives intended to
    improve manufacturing efficiency, including



integrate-to-order,

module-final-test and

merge-in-transit

programs. Applied also is implementing a multi-year,
    company-wide program to transform certain business processes,
    including the transition to a single enterprise resource
    planning (ERP) software system to perform various functions. The
    implementation of additional functionality to the ERP system
    entails certain risks, including difficulties with changes in
    business processes that could disrupt Applied’s operations,
    such as its ability to track orders and timely ship products,
    project inventory requirements, manage its supply chain and
    aggregate financial and operational data. The implementation of
    new initiatives may not achieve the anticipated benefits and may
    divert management’s attention from other operational
    activities, negatively affect employee morale, or have other
    unintended consequences.

If Applied does not effectively develop and implement its
    off-shoring and outsourcing strategies, if required export and
    other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, if
    Applied’s third party providers do not perform as
    anticipated, or if there are delays or difficulties in
    implementing a new ERP system or enhancing business processes,
    Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or
    cost efficiencies, and may experience operational difficulties,
    increased costs (including energy and transportation),
    manufacturing interruptions or delays, inefficiencies in the
    structure

and/or

operation of its supply chain, loss of its intellectual property
    rights, quality issues, increased product

time-to-market

and/or

inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which
    could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

The
    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital
    to Applied’s success.

Applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part
    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.
    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,
    including fluctuations in global economic and industry
    conditions, changes in Applied’s management or leadership,
    competitors’ hiring practices, cost reduction activities
    (including workforce reductions, unpaid shutdowns and salary
    reductions), and the effectiveness of Applied’s
    compensation and benefit programs, including its equity-based
    programs. Applied periodically evaluates its overall
    compensation program and makes adjustments, as appropriate, to
    enhance its competitiveness. If Applied does not successfully
    attract, retain and motivate key employees, Applied may be
    unable to capitalize on its opportunities and its operating
    results may be materially and adversely affected.

Changes
    in tax rates or tax assets and liabilities could affect results
    of operations.

As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the
    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment
    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
    Applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be
    affected by numerous factors, including changes in the:
    (1) applicable tax laws; (2) amount and composition of
    pre-tax income in countries with differing tax rates; or
    (3) valuation of Applied’s deferred tax assets and
    liabilities. In addition, Applied is subject to regular
    examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
    authorities, and from time to time initiates amendments to
    previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the
    likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from
    these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of
    its provision for income taxes. Although Applied believes its
    tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the
    tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have
    to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the
    estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can
    be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any
    final determination will not be materially different from the
    treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax
    provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely
    affect Applied’s financial condition and results of
    operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or
    claims and protection of intellectual property
    rights.

Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved
    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,
    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental
    regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product
    liability, unfair competition, employment and other matters. In
    addition, Applied on occasion receives notification from
    customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or
    other obligations related to claims made against such customers
    by third parties. These legal proceedings and claims, whether
    with or without merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to
    prosecute or defend, divert management’s attention and
    resources,

and/or

inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products. There can
    be no assurance regarding the outcome of



current or future legal proceedings or claims. Applied
    previously entered into a mutual covenant-not-to-sue arrangement
    with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of patent
    infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be no assurance
    that the intended results of this arrangement will be achieved
    or that Applied will be able to adequately protect its
    intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated
    with such a covenant. In addition, Applied’s success
    depends in significant part on the protection of its
    intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of
    Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized
    manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in
    uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied.
    Applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide
    significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented,
    invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of
    technological change, or if Applied does not adequately protect
    or assert these rights. Furthermore, the laws and practices of
    other countries, including China, India, Taiwan and Korea,
    permit the protection and enforcement of Applied’s rights
    to varying extents, which may not be sufficient to protect
    Applied’s rights. If Applied is not able to obtain or
    enforce intellectual property rights, resolve or settle claims,
    obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms,

and/or

successfully prosecute or defend its intellectual property
    position, Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and
    safety regulations.

Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in
    connection with its global business operations, including but
    not limited to: regulations related to the development,
    manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of
    materials used in its products or in producing its products; the
    operation of its facilities; and the use of its real property.
    The failure or inability to comply with existing or future
    environmental and safety regulations could result in:
    (1) significant remediation liabilities; (2) the
    imposition of fines; (3) the suspension or termination of
    the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of its
    products; (4) limitations on the operation of its
    facilities or ability to use its real property;

and/or

(5) a decrease in the value of its real property, each of
    which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory
    environment.

Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,
    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and
    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies

and/or

regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates;
    (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional
    regulatory agencies related to international trade; and
    (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and
    regulations. If Applied is found by a court or regulatory agency
    not to be in compliance with applicable laws, rules or
    regulations, Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
    Applied must include in its Annual Report on

Form 10-K

a report of management on the effectiveness of Applied’s
    internal control over financial reporting. Ongoing compliance
    with this requirement is complex, costly and time-consuming. If
    Applied fails to maintain effective internal control over
    financial reporting or Applied’s management does not timely
    assess the adequacy of such internal control, Applied could be
    subject to regulatory sanctions and the public’s perception
    of Applied may decline.

Dividends

During fiscal 2009, Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per
    share each quarter. The fourth quarterly cash dividend declared
    in fiscal 2009 was paid on December 3, 2009 to stockholders
    of record as of November 12, 2009. During fiscal 2008,
    Applied’s Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash
    dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each quarter.
    Dividends declared during fiscal 2009 and fiscal 2008 totaled
    $320 million and $325 million, respectively. Applied
    currently anticipates that it will continue to pay cash
    dividends on a quarterly basis in the future, although the
    declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of
    the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s
    financial condition, results of operations, capital
    requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as
    a determination that cash dividends are in the best interest of
    Applied’s stockholders.

Repurchases
    of Applied Common Stock

In November 2008, Applied announced that it was suspending stock
    repurchases in order to maintain financial flexibility in light
    of the deteriorating global economic and market conditions. The
    stock repurchase program that the Board of Directors approved in
    2006 expired in September 2009.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Introduction

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
    and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to facilitate
    an understanding of Applied’s business and results of
    operations. This MD&A should be read in conjunction with
    Applied’s Consolidated Financial Statements and the
    accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included
    elsewhere in this

Form 10-K.

The following discussion contains forward-looking statements and
    should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement
    set forth at the beginning of this

Form 10-K.

MD&A consists of the following sections:

•

Overview:

a summary of Applied’s business,
    measurements and opportunities.

•

Results of Operations:

a discussion of operating results.

•

Segment Information:

a discussion of segment operating
    results.

•

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources:

an
    analysis of cash flows, sources and uses of cash, contractual
    obligations and financial position.

•

Critical Accounting Policies:

a discussion of critical
    accounting policies that require the exercise of judgments and
    estimates.

Overview

Applied provides Nanomanufacturing
    Technology

tm

solutions for the global semiconductor, flat panel display,
    solar and related industries, with a broad portfolio of
    innovative equipment, service and software products.
    Applied’s customers are primarily manufacturers of
    semiconductors, flat panel liquid crystal displays (LCDs), solar
    photovoltaic cells and modules (solar PVs), flexible electronics
    and energy-efficient glass. Applied operates in four reportable
    segments: Silicon, Applied Global Services, Display, and Energy
    and Environmental Solutions. Product development and
    manufacturing activities occur primarily in North America,
    Europe, Israel and Asia. Applied’s broad range of equipment
    and service products are highly technical and are sold primarily
    through a direct sales force.

Applied’s results historically have been driven primarily
    by worldwide demand for semiconductors, which in turn depends on
    end-user demand for electronic products. Each of Applied’s
    businesses is subject to cyclical industry conditions, as demand
    for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on
    supply and demand for chips, LCDs, solar PVs and other
    electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global
    economic and market conditions, and technological advances in
    fabrication processes. Credit constraints in the financial
    markets and the weak global economy are compounding the impact
    of the highly cyclical markets in which Applied operates.

Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced
    demand for manufacturing equipment and services due to extremely
    unfavorable global economic and industry conditions,
    particularly in the first half of fiscal 2009. Negative trends
    in consumer spending and pervasive economic uncertainty led some
    customers to dramatically reduce factory operations and to
    reduce their spending. In the second half of fiscal 2009, demand
    for semiconductor and display equipment increased, but was still
    down significantly from fiscal 2008 levels. Fiscal 2009
    financial results included charges associated with restructuring
    programs. While Applied achieved profitability in the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2009, a meaningful improvement in the
    equipment sector for fiscal 2010 will depend on a recovery



in customers’ end markets sufficient to support factories
    running at higher utilization and to encourage customers’
    investments in new capacity, as well as advanced technologies.
    Applied currently expects a recovery in fiscal 2010,
    particularly in the market for semiconductor capital equipment,
    and anticipates that total net sales will increase more than
    30 percent in fiscal 2010 as compared to fiscal 2009.

Fiscal 2008 financial results reflected decreased demand for
    semiconductor equipment and, to a lesser extent, service
    products, due to unfavorable market conditions in the
    semiconductor industry, partially offset by increased demand for
    LCD and solar products. New orders decreased from fiscal 2007
    due to lower demand for semiconductor equipment from memory,
    foundry and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by
    increased demand by LCD customers and, beginning in the first
    quarter of fiscal 2008, the recognition of orders for
    Applied’s
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line for manufacturing solar panels. Net sales
    decreased during fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to the
    decline in investment from memory and logic customers, partially
    offset by increased sales of crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar
    manufacturing products. Net income decreased in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007 due to lower net sales, offset in part
    by lower operating expenses. Fiscal 2008 financial results
    included charges associated with restructuring programs.

Fiscal 2007 financial results reflected improved conditions in
    the semiconductor industry that began with the industry’s
    recovery in 2006, while conditions in the display industry were
    mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite
    strong consumer demand for LCD TVs. Total orders decreased
    slightly from fiscal 2006, primarily due to the significant
    decline in demand for display manufacturing products, partially
    offset by increased demand for products and services in all
    other segments. Net sales in fiscal 2007 reflected strong demand
    from dynamic random access memory (DRAM) and flash memory chip
    manufacturers, partially offset by a significant decline in LCD
    equipment sales as manufacturers absorbed capacity following
    substantial investment in 2006. Improved net income in fiscal
    2007 reflected higher sales and lower operating expenses, offset
    in part by lower interest income. Fiscal 2007 financial results
    included restructuring and asset impairment and other charges
    associated with ceasing development of beamline implant
    products, and an in-process research and development
    (IPR&D) expense associated with the acquisition of certain
    net assets of Brooks Automation, Inc. (Brooks Software).

Applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry
    conditions in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. As a result of these
    conditions and the global economic environment, there were
    significant fluctuations in Applied’s quarterly new orders
    and net sales, both within and across the fiscal years. Demand
    for manufacturing equipment has historically been volatile as a
    result of sudden changes in chip, LCD and solar PV supply and
    demand and other factors, including global economic and market
    conditions and rapid technological advances in fabrication
    processes. In response to the challenging economic environment
    in fiscal 2009, Applied implemented certain temporary cost
    reduction programs such as company-wide shutdowns.

New
    Orders

New orders by geographic region, which are attributed according
    to the location of customers’ facilities, were as follows:

Primarily the United States.

New orders decreased 55 percent to $4.1 billion in
    fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders
    was across all segments, and particularly in the semiconductor
    and display businesses, reflecting the challenging economic and
    industry conditions prevalent during fiscal 2009. Customer
    demand for semiconductor and LCD equipment began to recover in
    the second half of fiscal 2009.

New orders decreased 5 percent to $9.2 billion in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to lower demand for
    semiconductor equipment from logic, memory, and foundry chip
    manufacturers, partially offset by increased demand for LCD and
    solar equipment, including the initial recognition of orders for
    the Applied SunFab Thin Film Line. Demand for LCD equipment
    slowed substantially in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, as
    Display customers absorbed capacity following robust demand over
    the preceding three quarters.

New orders for fiscal 2007 decreased 2 percent to
    $9.7 billion from $9.9 billion in the prior year,
    reflecting delays in investment by LCD customers, partially
    offset by increased demand for solar equipment, semiconductor
    equipment, and service products. Demand for semiconductor
    equipment slowed in the second half of fiscal 2007 as customers
    absorbed added capacity, while demand from LCD customers
    recovered in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007.

Applied’s backlog as of the end of each of the last three
    fiscal years was as follows: $2.7 billion at
    October 25, 2009, $4.8 billion at October 26,
    2008, and $3.7 billion at October 28, 2007. Backlog
    decreased in fiscal 2009 primarily due to customer cancellations
    and financial debookings which totaled $1.2 billion,
    reflecting the decline in demand for semiconductor equipment.
    Backlog consists of: (1) orders for which written
    authorizations have been accepted and assigned shipment dates
    are within the next 12 months, or shipment has occurred but
    revenue has not been recognized; (2) contractual service
    revenue and maintenance fees to be earned within the next
    12 months; and (3) orders for SunFab lines that are
    anticipated to be recognized as revenue within the next
    12 months. Due to the potential for customer changes in
    delivery schedules or cancellation of orders, Applied’s
    backlog at any particular time is not necessarily indicative of
    actual sales for any future periods.



Net
    Sales

Net sales decreased 38 percent to $5.0 billion in
    fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, as a result of
    significantly lower sales of equipment and services to
    semiconductor and display customers, partially offset by
    increased sales of solar manufacturing equipment. Net sales
    decreased 16 percent to $8.1 billion in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007, due to decreased investment from memory
    and logic chip manufacturers, partially offset by increased
    demand from solar and LCD customers. During fiscal 2007, net
    sales increased by 6 percent, to $9.7 billion from
    $9.2 billion in fiscal 2006, led by strength in memory
    capacity expansion throughout the year.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to
    28.5 percent in fiscal 2009 from 42.4 percent in
    fiscal 2008, compared to 46.1 percent in fiscal 2007. The
    decrease in the gross margin percentage in fiscal 2009 from
    fiscal 2008 was due to lower net sales, lower-margin product
    mix, and reduced factory absorption, offset in part by cost
    control initiatives. The decrease in the gross margin percentage
    from fiscal 2007 to fiscal 2008 was attributable to lower net
    sales and lower margin product mix. Gross margin during fiscal
    2009, 2008 and 2007 included $28 million, $32 million
    and $27 million, respectively, of equity-based compensation
    expense.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable
    extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the
    equipment and service products it provides. Applied believes
    that it is critical to continue to make substantial investments
    in RD&E to assure the availability of innovative technology
    that meets the current and projected requirements of its
    customers’ most advanced designs. Applied historically has
    maintained its commitment to investing in RD&E in order to
    continue to offer new products and technologies. RD&E
    expenses were $934 million (19 percent of net sales)
    in fiscal 2009, $1.1 billion (14 percent of net sales)
    in fiscal 2008 and $1.1 billion (12 percent of net
    sales) in fiscal 2007. RD&E expense during fiscal 2009,
    2008 and 2007 included $50 million, $59 million and
    $56 million, respectively, of equity-based compensation
    expense. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months
    depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an
    existing product, which typically has a shorter development
    cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer
    development cycle. Most of Applied’s existing products
    resulted from internal development activities and innovations
    involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain
    instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or
    new product areas, to complement its existing technology
    capabilities and to reduce time to market.

In fiscal 2009, Applied focused on developing systems for
    semiconductor customers’ new chip designs with 32nm and
    below geometries, including systems to enable faster transistors
    using strain engineering and

high-k/metal

gate technologies, as well as double patterning processes that
    enable customers to extend their existing 193nm lithography
    tools through additional technology generations. Applied also
    focused on developing



technology for manufacturing next generation displays. RD&E
    also included activities to develop products that enable
    lower-cost production of solar energy and other products to
    enable energy conservation.

In fiscal 2008, Applied focused on the development of processes
    and systems for the continued scaling of semiconductor devices.
    Applied pioneered a self-aligned double patterning approach that
    can enable 22nm and below device fabrication using conventional
    optical lithography. The Company also developed technology for
    the implementation of through-silicon vias. Efforts were also
    focused on developing the systems and technology to reduce the

cost-per-watt

of solar electricity.

In fiscal 2007, Applied focused on developing systems for
    customers’ new chip designs with 45nm and below geometries,
    including systems to enable faster transistors using strain
    engineering and high-k/metal gate technologies, and patterning
    processes to enable customers to extend their existing 193 nm
    lithography tools through additional technology generations.
    Applied also continued to invest in solar research and
    development.

There were no IPR&D charges recorded in either fiscal 2009
    or 2008. During fiscal 2007, Applied recorded an IPR&D
    expense of $5 million associated with the acquisition of
    certain net assets of Brooks Software, a division of Brooks
    Automation Inc. Applied’s methodology for allocating the
    purchase price relating to purchased acquisitions to IPR&D
    was determined through established valuation techniques. The
    IPR&D was expensed upon acquisition because technological
    feasibility had not been established and no future alternative
    uses existed.

Marketing,
    Selling, General and Administrative

Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $735 million (15 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2009,
    $965 million (12 percent of net sales) in fiscal 2008,
    and $952 million (10 percent of net sales) in fiscal
    2007. The decrease in marketing, selling, general and
    administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was
    primarily due to cost control initiatives. The increase in
    marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses in
    fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was principally attributable to
    increased operating costs from business acquisitions and equity
    compensation expenses, offset in part by cost control
    initiatives. Marketing, selling and general and administrative
    expenses during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 included
    $69 million, $88 million and $77 million,
    respectively, of equity-based compensation expense.

Restructuring
    and Asset Impairments

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Applied announced a
    restructuring program to reduce its global workforce by
    approximately 1,800 positions. During the second quarter of
    fiscal 2009, Applied expanded the scope of the restructuring
    program by approximately 200 positions. During fiscal 2009,
    Applied recorded restructuring charges of $143 million
    associated with this program. The restructuring charges
    consisted of employee related costs to reduce the Company’s
    workforce through a combination of attrition, voluntary
    separation and other workforce reduction programs. During fiscal
    2009, Applied also determined that the carrying value of certain
    fixed assets to be sold exceeded the estimated fair value and,
    as a result, recorded a $15 million impairment charge.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied announced a
    global cost reduction plan that primarily affected its Silicon
    and Applied Global Services segments and related support
    organizations. As part of this plan, Applied reduced its global
    workforce through a combination of job elimination and
    attrition. For fiscal 2008, Applied recorded restructuring
    charges of $29 million relating to this plan, consisting
    primarily of employee related costs to reduce its workforce. The
    affected employees were based in North America, Europe and Asia,
    and represented multiple functions.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2007, Applied announced a
    plan (the Implant Plan) to cease development of beamline implant
    products for semiconductor manufacturing and curtail the
    operations of its Implant group based in Horsham, England. Under
    the Implant Plan, Applied closed its research, development and
    manufacturing operations in Horsham in October 2007.
    Restructuring charges under the Implant Plan for fiscal 2008
    totaled $11 million and were associated with facilities.
    Restructuring and asset impairment charges under the Implant
    Plan in fiscal 2007 aggregated $30 million and consisted of
    $21 million in restructuring charges primarily associated
    with employee related costs and $9 million in asset
    impairments. The majority of the affected employees were based
    in Horsham, England, and represented multiple functions. Costs
    associated with the Implant Plan in fiscal 2007 also



included inventory-related charges, reported as cost of products
    sold, of $56 million and other operating expenses of
    $10 million. The Implant group operated in the Silicon
    segment, and the results of its operations were not material to
    Applied’s financial position or results of operations.

For further details, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Net
    Interest Income

Net interest income was $27 million for fiscal 2009,
    $89 million for fiscal 2008, and $98 million for
    fiscal 2007. The decrease in net interest and other income in
    fiscal 2009 from fiscal 2008 was primarily due to a decrease in
    interest rates. The decrease in net interest and other income in
    fiscal 2008 from fiscal 2007 was primarily due to a reduction in
    investments and a decrease in interest rates, offset by a
    decrease in interest expense associated with scheduled debt
    maturities that occurred in September 2007.

Income
    Taxes

Applied’s effective income tax rate for fiscal 2009 was a
    benefit of 37.2 percent as compared to a provision of
    31.8 percent for fiscal 2008, and a provision of
    29.9 percent for fiscal 2007. The change in the fiscal 2009
    tax rate from the fiscal 2008 rate was principally attributable
    to the net loss before taxes incurred in fiscal 2009.
    Applied’s effective tax rate was higher for fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007 as fiscal 2007 reflected a benefit of
    $36 million principally related to the favorable resolution
    of audits of prior years’ income tax filings, partially
    offset by a $13 million charge from the expensing of
    equity-based compensation.

Applied’s future effective income tax rate depends on
    various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic
    composition of Applied’s pre-tax income, and non-tax
    deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions.
    Management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts
    the effective income tax rate accordingly.

Segment
    Information

Applied operates in four reportable segments: Silicon, Applied
    Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental
    Solutions. A description of the products and services, as well
    as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found in
    Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain
    operating expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate
    level. These unallocated costs include those for equity-based
    compensation and certain components of variable compensation,
    corporate marketing and sales, corporate functions (certain
    management, finance, legal, human resources and RD&E), and
    unabsorbed information technology and occupancy.

Discussions below include the results of each reportable segment.

Silicon
    Segment

The Silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for
    deposition, etch, rapid thermal processing (RTP), chemical
    mechanical planarization (CMP), and metrology and inspection.
    Development efforts are focused on solving customers’ key
    technical challenges, including transistor performance and
    nanoscale patterning, and on improving chip manufacturing
    productivity to reduce costs.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years
    were as follows:

Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced
    demand for manufacturing equipment due to extremely unfavorable
    global economic and industry conditions. Silicon new orders
    decreased 59 percent to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2009
    compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders reflected
    significantly lower demand, primarily from memory and logic
    customers. Net sales decreased 51 percent to
    $2.0 billion in fiscal 2009



compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in net sales was due to
    decreased capital investments, primarily by memory customers.
    Operating income decreased 88 percent to $152 million
    in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008. The decrease in
    operating income was due to significantly lower sales resulting
    in lower factory absorption, partially offset by lower operating
    expenses from cost control initiatives. Operating income for
    fiscal 2009 also reflected an increase in bad debt expense.
    After an operating loss in the first half of fiscal 2009, the
    Silicon segment returned to operating profitability during the
    second half of the year, which was primarily driven by sales to
    foundry customers. During the year, the Company introduced a new
    platform specifically designed for under-bump metallization
    (UBM) and other back-end processes, the Applied Charger UBM PVD
    system.

Fiscal 2008 Silicon new orders decreased 38 percent to
    $4.1 billion compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in new
    orders was due to reduced demand for equipment from logic,
    memory and foundry customers. Net sales decreased
    38 percent to $4.0 billion in fiscal 2008 compared to
    fiscal 2007. The decrease in net sales was due to decreased
    investment by logic and memory customers. Operating income
    decreased 48 percent to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2008
    compared to fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating income was
    due to significantly lower revenue levels from the slowdown in
    the semiconductor equipment industry, partially offset by lower
    operating expenses attributable to continued focus on cost
    controls and improvement in manufacturing activities. In fiscal
    2008, the Company launched two key products for photomask
    applications: the Applied Aera2 Mask Inspection system, which
    detects critical defects on a photomask, and the Applied Tetra
    Reticle Clean system, which cleans 32nm and below photomasks
    using wet clean chemistry. The Company also introduced the
    Applied Producer eHARP system for depositing films in high
    aspect ratio device structures.

Silicon orders in fiscal 2007 reflected the semiconductor
    industry’s strength during this period, driven by demand
    for cell phones, computers, digital TVs, game consoles, MP3
    players and other electronic products. The majority of new
    orders were for memory applications as customers invested in
    leading-edge flash and DRAM memory devices, while orders from
    foundries remained at low levels. Net sales reflected increased
    investment by memory and logic semiconductor customers in
    multiple areas, including etch, inspection, and RTP products.
    Operating income reflected higher revenue levels and continued
    focus on cost controls. Operating income for fiscal 2007
    included charges of $66 million related to ceasing
    development of beamline implant products. In fiscal 2007, the
    Company launched the Applied Producer GT for chemical vapor
    deposition processing for 45 nm and beyond applications. Applied
    also announced its portfolio of high-k/metal gate solutions,
    including the Applied Advanced Gate Stack and Applied Centura
    Carina Etch systems. Other new etch systems introduced were the
    Applied Mariana Trench, for etching high aspect ratio
    structures, the Applied Opus AdvantEdge Metal Etch with a

new 5-chamber

platform, and the Applied Centura Tetra III Advanced
    Reticle Etch. The Company also added to its line of
    lithography-enabling systems with the new Applied Producer ACE
    SACVD and added to its line of strain engineering solutions with
    the Applied Producer Celera CVD.

Applied
    Global Services Segment

The Applied Global Services segment encompasses technically
    differentiated products, including spares, services, certain
    earlier generation equipment products, and remanufactured
    equipment, to improve operating efficiency, reduce operating
    costs, and lessen the environmental impact of semiconductor,
    display and solar customers’ factories. Customer demand for
    products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution
    system with trained service engineers located in close proximity
    to customer sites.

Fiscal 2009 financial results reflected significantly reduced
    demand for manufacturing services due to extremely unfavorable
    global economic and industry conditions, as well as a
    significant reduction in the installed base of 200mm systems.
    New orders decreased 48 percent to $1.2 billion in
    fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008, due primarily to decreased
    demand for spares and refurbished equipment arising from
    semiconductor manufacturers’



low wafer production volumes. Net sales decreased
    40 percent to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008, reflecting lower sales of spares and refurbished
    equipment. Operating income decreased 80 percent to
    $113 million in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as a
    result of lower sales volumes, which led to lower infrastructure
    cost absorption, partially offset by lower operating expenses
    from cost control initiatives. Operating income for fiscal 2009
    also included an increase in bad debt expense. In the second
    half of fiscal 2009, the Applied Global Services segment
    returned to operating profitability as sales of spares improved.

Fiscal 2008 results were impacted by lower levels of
    semiconductor and display customers’ factory utilization.
    New orders decreased 10 percent to $2.2 billion in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007, due to lower orders for
    spares, fab-wide services, and refurbished equipment, partially
    offset by increased orders for service and system enhancements.
    Net sales decreased 1 percent to $2.3 billion in
    fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007. The net sales decrease
    reflected lower sales of fab-wide services and spares, offset by
    increased sales in services and system enhancements. Operating
    income decreased 9 percent to $575 million in fiscal
    2008 compared to fiscal 2007 due to higher operating expenses in
    fiscal 2008.

New orders in fiscal 2007 reflected increased demand for spare
    parts and services, as well as demand for factory automation
    products obtained as part of the Brooks Software acquisition.
    Net sales in fiscal 2007 reflected increases in factory
    automation sales offset by declines in spares sales. Fiscal 2007
    remanufactured equipment orders and net sales remained
    consistent with fiscal 2006 levels. Operating income compared to
    fiscal 2006 reflected changes in product mix and increased
    operating expenses and charges related to the Brooks Software
    acquisition.

Display
    Segment

The Display segment encompasses products for manufacturing LCDs
    for TVs, personal computers and other video-enabled devices. The
    business is focused on expanding market share by differentiation
    with larger-scale substrates, entry into new markets, and
    development of products to enable cost reductions through
    productivity and uniformity.

    economic and industry conditions. New orders decreased
    significantly to $287 million in fiscal 2009 compared to
    $1.5 billion in fiscal 2008, which reflected the slowdown
    in the display industry from fiscal 2008 when display
    manufacturers added capacity. Net sales decreased
    49 percent to $502 million in fiscal 2009 compared to
    fiscal 2008 as a result of significantly lower orders. Operating
    income decreased to $65 million in fiscal 2009 from
    $310 million in fiscal 2008. Operating income decreased due
    to significantly lower revenue, partially offset by lower
    operating expenses due to cost control initiatives.

In fiscal 2008, new orders increased significantly to
    $1.5 billion compared to $273 million in fiscal 2007.
    Increased orders were due to substantial increases in demand by
    Display customers in response to strong end-product demand. This
    demand for LCD equipment reached an inflection point in the
    third quarter of fiscal 2008 and decreased significantly in the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, reflecting the volatility of the
    display industry. Net sales increased 38 percent to
    $976 million in fiscal 2008 compared to fiscal 2007,
    primarily due to customers’ investment in Gen-8 products.
    Operating income increased to $310 million in fiscal 2008
    from $159 million in fiscal 2007. Operating income
    increased due to higher revenue levels, product mix and lower
    operating costs. In fiscal 2008, the Company introduced its
    Gen-10 systems that can process substrates sized at
    approximately 2.85 x 3.05 meters. These systems include the
    AKT-90K PECVD and AKT-90K EBT products.

New orders for fiscal 2007 reflected delays in capacity
    expansion plans by LCD panel makers in light of excess
    inventories and end product sales price declines. Display
    customers increased spending levels in the fourth quarter



of fiscal 2007 as panel makers began to experience more
    favorable market conditions. Net sales reflected lower
    investment by LCD manufacturers as they absorbed capacity.
    Operating income reflected lower revenues and factory
    absorption, product mix and higher operating expenses in support
    of the expanded product portfolio resulting from the acquisition
    of Applied Films in July 2006. In 2007, Applied launched the
    AKT-PiVot

tm

55KV system, which employs high-productivity, cost-efficient PVD
    technology to deposit metal and transparent conductive oxide
    films on the substrate.

Energy
    and Environmental Solutions Segment

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products
    for fabricating solar PV cells and modules, high throughput

roll-to-roll

coating systems for flexible electronics and web products, and
    systems used in the manufacture of energy-efficient glass. This
    segment also includes products for manufacturing c-Si solar PVs
    that were obtained through the acquisitions of HCT Shaping
    Systems SA (HCT) in fiscal 2007 and Baccini S.p.A. (Baccini) in
    fiscal 2008. This business is focused on delivering solutions to
    generate and conserve energy, with an emphasis on lowering the
    cost to produce solar power by providing equipment to enhance
    manufacturing scale and efficiency.

Certain significant measures for the past three fiscal years
    were as follows:

$


$


$


New orders of $955 million in fiscal 2009 decreased from
    $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease in new orders was
    primarily due to decreased demand from c-Si customers and
    reflected the challenging global economic environment, solar
    manufacturers’ difficulties in obtaining cost-effective
    capital, and a decrease in end demand. Net sales of
    $1.2 billion in fiscal 2009 increased from
    $819 million in fiscal 2008 due to an increase in sales for
    the Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line. The operating loss of $242 million in
    fiscal 2009 increased from $183 million in fiscal 2008 due
    to an increase in RD&E expenses and unfavorable gross
    margins associated with initial SunFab line

start-ups,

offset in part by cost control initiatives. In 2009, the Company
    introduced its Baccini Esatto Technology, a high precision,
    multi-step printing capability designed to increase the
    efficiency of c-Si solar cells, and its Applied HCT MaxEdge wire
    saw, featuring the industry’s first dual-wire management
    system for slicing ultra-thin silicon wafers.

New orders of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008 increased from
    $245 million in fiscal 2007. The increase in new orders was
    primarily due to the recognition of orders for the SunFab line
    beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2008, as well as growth
    in orders for c-Si products. Net sales of $819 million in
    fiscal 2008 increased from $165 million in fiscal 2007 due
    to customers’ investment in c-Si products from the
    acquisitions of HCT and Baccini, in addition to increased sales
    across all other products in the segment. The increase in net
    sales for fiscal 2008 included the first revenue recognition of
    a SunFab line. The operating loss of $183 million in fiscal
    2008 increased from $89 million in fiscal 2007. The
    increase in operating loss reflected increased RD&E
    spending to develop products that enable lower-cost production
    of solar energy, increased operating costs, amortization of
    acquisition-related costs, and costs related to expansion of
    solar marketing efforts, partially offset by higher revenues.

New orders in fiscal 2007 reflected increased demand for c-Si
    solar, glass and flexible electronics products. Net sales in
    fiscal 2007 reflected higher net sales in glass, flexible
    electronics and c-Si solar products. Operating loss for fiscal
    2007 reflected increased RD&E spending to develop products
    and services that enable lower-cost production of solar energy
    and costs related to expansion of solar marketing efforts,
    offset by higher revenues. In fiscal 2007, Applied introduced
    the Applied
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Line, the first integrated production line designed
    for manufacturing thin film silicon solar modules using
    5.7 square meter glass panels.



Business
    Combinations

On November 16, 2009, Applied entered into an agreement to
    acquire all of the outstanding shares of Semitool, Inc.
    (Semitool), a public company based in the state of Montana, for
    $11 per share in an all-cash tender offer. Semitool is a leading
    supplier of electrochemical plating and wafer surface
    preparation equipment used by semiconductor packaging and
    manufacturing companies globally. Under the terms of the
    agreement approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies,
    Applied will pay an aggregate purchase price of approximately
    $364 million based on the fully-diluted capitalization of
    Semitool. The acquisition will be conducted through a tender
    offer for all of the outstanding shares of Semitool and is
    conditioned on the occurrence or absence of certain events,
    including the tender of at least 66.67% of Semitool’s
    outstanding stock on a fully-diluted basis, as well as
    regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. In
    connection with this tender offer, Applied has been named as a
    defendant in three purported class action lawsuits filed in
    Montana state court. For further details, see Note 15 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

On January 31, 2008, Applied acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately-held company based in
    Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of
    cash and marketable securities acquired. The acquired business
    is a leading supplier of automated metallization and test
    systems for manufacturing c-Si photovoltaic cells.

On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum,
    Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts
    cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million.

On August 23, 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding
    shares of Switzerland-based HCT for $463 million in cash,
    net of cash acquired. The acquired business is the world’s
    leading supplier of precision wafering systems used principally
    in manufacturing c-Si substrates for the solar industry.

On March 30, 2007, Applied purchased Brooks Software for
    $137 million in cash. The acquired business is a leading
    provider of factory management and control software to the
    semiconductor and flat panel display industries. Its products
    complement Applied’s existing software applications and
    enable Applied to offer customers a comprehensive computer
    integrated manufacturing solution for optimizing fab operations.

For further details, see Notes 14 and 15 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for
    revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. This
    authoritative guidance impacts the determination of when the
    individual deliverables included in a multiple-element
    arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting.
    Additionally, this guidance modifies the manner in which the
    transaction consideration is allocated across the separately
    identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual
    method of allocating arrangement consideration. Applied will
    adopt this authoritative guidance prospectively commencing in
    its first quarter of fiscal 2010. The implementation is not
    expected to have a material impact on Applied’s financial
    position or results of operations.

In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the
    accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include
    software elements. This authoritative guidance amends the scope
    of pre-existing software revenue guidance by removing from the
    guidance non-software components of tangible products and
    certain software components of tangible products. Applied will
    adopt this authoritative guidance prospectively commencing in
    its first quarter of fiscal 2010. The implementation is not
    expected to have a material impact on Applied’s financial
    position or results of operations.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on variable
    interest entities, which becomes effective the first annual
    reporting period after November 15, 2009 and will be
    effective for Applied in fiscal 2011. This authoritative
    guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities
    represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of
    control over such entities, and additional disclosures for
    variable interests. Applied is evaluating the potential impact
    of the implementation of this authoritative guidance on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on
    accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
    business combination that arise from contingencies, which amends
    the provisions related to the initial



recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and
    disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies
    in a business combination under previously issued guidance. The
    authoritative guidance requires that such contingencies be
    recognized at fair value on the acquisition date if fair value
    can be reasonably estimated during the allocation period. This
    authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in fiscal
    2010. Applied expects that this authoritative guidance will have
    an impact on its consolidated financial statements, but the
    nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon
    the nature, term and size of the acquired contingencies.

In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on
    employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined
    benefit pension or other postretirement plan. Applied will
    comply with this authoritative guidance in fiscal 2010.

In December 2007, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance on
    business combinations, including the measurement of acquirer
    shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the
    recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for
    preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, the recognition of
    capitalized

in-process

research and development, the accounting for acquisition-related
    restructuring cost accruals, the treatment of
    acquisition-related transaction costs, and the recognition of
    changes in the acquirer’s income tax valuation allowance.
    This authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in
    fiscal 2010, with early adoption prohibited. Applied expects
    that this authoritative guidance will have an impact on its
    consolidated financial statements, but the nature and magnitude
    of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, terms and
    size of the acquisitions it consummates after the effective date.

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on
    noncontrolling interests, which changes the accounting for
    noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial
    statements, including the requirements to classify
    noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated
    stockholders’ equity, and the elimination of “minority
    interest” accounting in results of operations with earnings
    attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of
    consolidated earnings. Additionally, this authoritative guidance
    revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a
    parent’s controlling ownership interest. This authoritative
    guidance will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010, with
    early adoption prohibited. Applied is evaluating the potential
    impact of the implementation of this authoritative guidance on
    its financial position or results of operations.

In February 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on the
    fair value option for financial assets and financial
    liabilities, which permits entities to elect to measure many
    financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that
    are not currently required to be measured at fair value. This
    election is irrevocable. This authoritative guidance became
    effective for Applied beginning with its 2009 fiscal year.
    Applied has not elected the fair value measurement option for
    its financial assets or liabilities that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value.

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for
    fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued
    authoritative guidance on fair value measurements for purposes
    of lease classification, which amends previously issued guidance
    on fair value measurements to remove certain leasing
    transactions from its scope. The FASB also issued authoritative
    guidance on the effective date of fair value measurements, which
    delays the effective date for Applied for all non-financial
    assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the
    beginning of Applied’s first quarter of fiscal 2010. The
    measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial
    assets and financial liabilities became effective for Applied
    beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In October 2008,
    the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the
    application of fair value measurements in a market that is not
    active, and provides guidance on the key considerations in
    determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market
    for that financial asset is not active. Applied adopted the
    effective portions of fair value measurements beginning in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 3 for information
    and related disclosures regarding Applied’s fair value
    measurements.



Financial
    Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Applied’s cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased
    to $3.3 billion at October 25, 2009 from
    $3.5 billion at October 26, 2008, due primarily to a
    decrease in cash generated from operating activities. Applied
    has not undertaken any significant external financing activities
    for several years.

Cash, cash equivalents and investments consist of the following:

Applied generated cash from operating activities of
    $333 million in fiscal 2009, $1.7 billion in fiscal
    2008, and $2.2 billion in fiscal 2007. The primary sources
    of cash from operations in fiscal 2009 were collections of
    accounts receivable and a reduction in inventories, which was
    offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses
    and in income taxes payable. The net loss incurred was offset by
    the effect of non-cash charges, including depreciation,
    amortization, restructuring and asset impairments, equity-based
    compensation, impairment of investments, and provision for bad
    debts. Applied utilized programs to discount letters of credit
    issued by customers of $299 million in fiscal 2009,
    $167 million in fiscal 2008, and $431 million in
    fiscal 2007. Discounting of letters of credit depends on many
    factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to
    discount the letters of credit and the cost of such
    arrangements. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, Applied factored accounts
    receivable and discounted promissory notes totaling
    $43 million and $138 million, respectively. Days sales
    outstanding were 75 days at the end of fiscal 2009 and
    79 days at the end of both fiscal 2008 and 2007.

Applied generated $113 million of cash from investing
    activities in fiscal 2009 and used $76 million and
    $977 million of cash in investing activities in fiscal 2008
    and 2007, respectively. Proceeds from sales and maturities of
    investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled
    $361 million in fiscal 2009 and $405 million in fiscal
    2008. Purchases of investments, net of proceeds from sales and
    maturities of investments, totaled $150 million in fiscal
    2007.

Capital expenditures were $248 million in fiscal 2009,
    $288 million in fiscal 2008, and $265 million in
    fiscal 2007. These expenditures were primarily for the
    implementation of an enterprise resource planning software
    system and the construction of a solar R&D/demonstration
    center in Xi’an, China. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2009
    also included investment to construct a facility in Singapore.

Investing activities also included investments in technology and
    acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market
    opportunities or emerging technologies. During fiscal 2008,
    Applied acquired all of the outstanding shares of Baccini, a
    privately-held company based in Italy, for a purchase price of
    $215 million in cash, net of cash and marketable securities
    acquired. Also in fiscal 2008, Applied also purchased certain
    assets from Edwards Vacuum, Inc. consisting of its Kachina
    semiconductor equipment parts cleaning and refurbishment
    business for $19 million. During fiscal 2007, Applied
    acquired all of the outstanding shares of HCT for
    $463 million in cash, net of cash acquired, and certain net
    assets of Brooks Automation, Inc. consisting of its Brooks
    Software division for $137 million in cash. See
    Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
    additional details.

Applied used cash of $281 million for financing activities
    in fiscal 2009, $1.4 billion in fiscal 2008, and
    $892 million in fiscal 2007. Financing activities included
    payment of cash dividends to stockholders and to a lesser extent
    issuances and repurchases of common stock. Since November 2008,
    Applied has temporarily suspended stock repurchases in order to
    maintain financial flexibility in light of uncertain global
    economic and market conditions. Cash used to repurchase shares
    totaled $23 million in fiscal 2009, $1.5 billion in
    fiscal 2008, and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2007. In each of
    fiscal 2009 and 2008, Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share
    each. The fourth quarterly cash dividend declared in fiscal 2009
    was paid on December 3, 2009 to stockholders of record as
    of November 12, 2009. During fiscal 2007, Applied’s
    Board



of Directors declared one quarterly cash dividend in the amount
    of $0.05 per share and three quarterly cash dividends in the
    amount of $0.06 per share each. Dividends paid during fiscal
    2009, 2008 and 2007 were $320 million, $325 million
    and $306 million, respectively. Applied currently
    anticipates that it will continue to pay cash dividends on a
    quarterly basis in the future, although the declaration of any
    future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of
    Directors and will depend on Applied’s financial condition,
    results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions
    and other factors, as well as a determination that cash
    dividends are in the best interest of Applied’s
    stockholders. Financing activities also included borrowings and
    repayments of debt. Applied did not have any borrowings in
    fiscal years 2009, 2008 or 2007. Cash used for debt repayments
    totaled $1 million for fiscal 2009, $2 million for
    fiscal 2008, and $202 million for fiscal 2007. Cash
    generated from issuances of common stock pursuant to
    Applied’s equity compensation programs totaled
    $62 million for fiscal 2009, $401 million for fiscal
    2008, and $948 million for fiscal 2007.

Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in
    various currencies of up to $1.2 billion, of which
    $1.0 billion is comprised of a

5-year

revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is
    scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for
    borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to
    one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance and
    includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in
    compliance at October 25, 2009. In May 2009, Applied
    amended certain terms of this credit agreement, including
    (i) replacing the funded-debt-to-adjusted-earnings ratio
    financial covenant with a minimum liquidity covenant and a
    funded-debt-to-total-capital ratio covenant and
    (ii) increasing the facility fee and applicable interest
    rate margins on advances. Remaining credit facilities in the
    amount of approximately $165 million are with Japanese
    banks. Applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities
    is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing
    request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the
    banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. No
    amounts were outstanding under any of the above credit
    facilities at October 25, 2009.

In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 25, 2009, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee arrangements was
    $83 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in
    connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that
    required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction
    being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical
    experience and information currently available, that it is
    probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under
    these guarantee arrangements.

Applied expects that changes in its business will affect its
    working capital components, primarily related to its Energy and
    Environmental Solutions segment, which includes products for
    manufacturing solar PVs. Applied has entered into contracts with
    multiple customers for its SunFab Thin Film Line for projects of
    varying scale. Fulfillment of these contracts requires Applied
    to invest in inventory, particularly work in process, which
    investment may be offset by customer deposits. Changes in these
    contracts may result in inventory charges if Applied determines
    the inventory to be in excess of anticipated demand.

Applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of
    investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury
    and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and, to
    a small extent, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as
    well as equity securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit
    risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures,
    which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such
    risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies.

In fiscal 2009, as part of its regular investment review
    process, Applied recorded impairment charges of $84 million
    associated with its equity method investment in Sokudo Co.,
    Ltd., other strategic investments and marketable securities. At
    October 25, 2009, Applied had a gross unrealized loss of
    $1 million due to a decrease in the fair value of certain
    fixed income securities. Applied regularly reviews its
    investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that
    have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in
    determining whether a loss is temporary include: the length of
    time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost
    basis; the financial condition, credit quality and near-term
    prospects of the investee; and whether it is more

likely-than-not

that Applied will be required to sell the security prior to any
    anticipated recovery in fair value. Generally, the contractual
    terms of the investments do not permit settlement at prices less
    than the amortized cost of the investments. While Applied cannot
    predict future market conditions or market liquidity, Applied
    believes that its



investment policies provide an appropriate means to manage the
    risks in its investment portfolio. The following types of
    financial instruments may present additional risks arising from
    liquidity

and/or

credit concerns: structured investment vehicles, auction rate
    securities,

sub-prime

and “Alt-A” mortgage-backed securities, and
    collateralized debt obligations. At October 25, 2009,
    Applied’s holdings in these categories of investments
    totaled $6 million, or less than 1% of total cash, cash
    equivalents and investments, which Applied does not consider to
    be material. In the event that these categories of investments
    become illiquid, Applied does not believe that this will
    materially affect its liquidity or results of operations.

During fiscal 2009, Applied recorded a bad debt provision of
    $63 million as a result of certain customers’
    deteriorating financial condition. While Applied believes that
    its allowance for doubtful accounts at October 25, 2009 is
    adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity
    and other economic conditions.

On November 11, 2009, Applied announced that it will
    implement a restructuring program beginning in the first quarter
    of fiscal 2010. As part of this program, Applied plans to reduce
    its global workforce as of October 25, 2009 by
    approximately 1,300 to 1,500 positions, or 10 to
    12 percent, over a period of 18 months, consistent
    with local legal requirements and in consultation with employee
    works councils and other representatives, as applicable. The
    Company anticipates cash outlays of between $100 million
    and $125 million for this plan.

On November 16, 2009, Applied entered into an agreement to
    acquire all of the outstanding shares of Semitool, a public
    company based in the state of Montana, for $11 per share in an
    all-cash tender offer. Under the terms of the agreement approved
    by the Boards of Directors of both companies, Applied will pay
    an aggregate purchase price of approximately $364 million
    based on the fully-diluted capitalization of Semitool. The
    acquisition will be conducted through a tender offer for all of
    the outstanding shares of Semitool and is conditioned on the
    occurrence or absence of certain events, including the tender of
    at least 66.67% of Semitool’s outstanding stock on a
    fully-diluted basis, as well as regulatory approvals and other
    customary closing conditions.

Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing
    and extent of factors such as those discussed above,
    Applied’s management believes that cash generated from
    operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing
    cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to
    satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next
    12 months. For further details regarding Applied’s
    operating, investing and financing activities for each of the
    three years in the period ended October 25, 2009, see the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 25, 2009, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee agreements was
    $83 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in
    connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond that
    required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction
    being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical
    experience and information currently available, that it is
    probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under
    these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total
    rental expense for operating leases was $64 million for
    fiscal 2009, $68 million for fiscal 2008, and
    $62 million for fiscal 2007.

Represents Applied’s agreements to purchase goods and
    services consisting of Applied’s (a) outstanding
    purchase orders for goods and services; and (b) contractual
    requirements to make specified minimum payments even if Applied
    does not take delivery of the contracted goods.

In addition to the contractual obligations disclosed above, the
    Company has certain tax obligations. Gross interest and
    penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to
    result in payment or receipt of cash within one year have been
    reported as non-current liabilities on the Consolidated Balance
    Sheet. As of October 25, 2009, the gross liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits was $325 million, exclusive of
    interest and penalties. Increases or decreases to interest and
    penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision
    for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
    Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were
    $8 million as of October 26, 2008 and $5 million
    as of October 25, 2009. All $5 million in interest and
    penalties is classified as long-term payable in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets. At this time, the Company is unable to make a
    reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in
    individual years due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit
    outcomes and, accordingly, such amounts are not included in the
    above contractual obligation table.

As discussed above, on November 16, 2009, Applied entered
    into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of
    Semitool, a public company based in the state of Montana, for
    $11 per share in an all-cash tender offer. Under the terms of
    the agreement approved by the Boards of Directors of both
    companies, Applied will pay an aggregate purchase price of
    approximately $364 million based on the fully-diluted
    capitalization of Semitool. The acquisition will be conducted
    through a tender offer for all of the outstanding shares of
    Semitool and is conditioned on the occurrence or absence of
    certain events, including the tender of at least 66.67% of
    Semitool’s outstanding stock on a fully-diluted basis, as
    well as regulatory approvals and other customary closing
    conditions.

Critical
    Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related
    disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
    amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in
    the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
    Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered
    to be critical accounting policies.

A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both
    material to the presentation of Applied’s consolidated
    financial statements and requires management to make difficult,
    subjective or complex judgments that could have a material
    effect on Applied’s financial condition or results of
    operations. Specifically, these policies have the following
    attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions
    about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the
    estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could
    reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are
    reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on
    Applied’s financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects
    cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates
    on historical experience and on various other assumptions
    believed to be applicable and



reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change
    as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and
    as Applied’s operating environment changes. These changes
    have historically been minor and have been included in the
    consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known.
    In addition, management is periodically faced with
    uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control
    and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These
    uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled
    “Risk Factors.” Based on a critical assessment of its
    accounting policies and the underlying judgments and
    uncertainties affecting the application of those policies,
    management believes that Applied’s consolidated financial
    statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
    and provide a meaningful presentation of Applied’s
    financial condition and results of operations.

Management believes that the following are critical accounting
    policies:

Warranty
    Costs

Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue
    is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by
    analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration
    statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied’s
    warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure
    rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting
    product failures during the warranty period. As Applied’s
    customer engineers and process support engineers are highly
    trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a
    significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and
    availability of critical replacement parts is another
    significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen
    component failures or exceptional component performance can also
    result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs
    differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to
    the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could
    have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Allowance
    for Doubtful Accounts

Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for
    estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers
    to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical
    experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection
    history and any customer-specific issues Applied has identified.
    Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse
    change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial
    obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied
    to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts
    due to Applied, which could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Inventory
    Valuation

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market,
    with cost determined on a

first-in,

first-out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for
    estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and
    the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
    demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for
    potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing
    historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are
    evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known
    and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If
    actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated,
    additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be
    required, which could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also
    annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives
    for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology,
    are generally recorded in connection with a business
    acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually
    based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the
    success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If
    actual product acceptance differs significantly from the
    estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment
    charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its
    realizable value. The fair value of a



reporting unit is estimated using both the income approach and
    the market approach taking into account such factors as future
    anticipated operating results and estimated cost of capital.
    Management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for
    potential impairment, especially in new emerging markets. A
    severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected
    impairment charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a
    material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Income
    Taxes

The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
    composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing
    each region, non-tax deductible expenses incurred in connection
    with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management
    carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the
    effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ
    from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a
    valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its
    effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax
    assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect
    of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of
    recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a
    valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion
    of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has
    determined that it is more likely than not that Applied’s
    future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred
    tax assets.

The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment
    in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of
    complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
    inconsistent with Applied’s expectations could have a
    material impact on Applied’s results of operations and
    financial condition.

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

At October 25, 2009, Applied’s investment portfolio
    included fixed-income securities with a fair value of
    approximately $2.6 billion. Applied’s primary
    objective for investing in fixed-income securities is to
    preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk.
    These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will
    decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on
    Applied’s investment portfolio at October 25, 2009, an
    immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would
    result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of
    approximately $21 million. While an increase in interest
    rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio,
    Applied will not realize the losses in the Consolidated
    Statement of Operations unless the individual fixed-income
    securities are sold prior to recovery or the investment is
    determined to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

All of Applied’s debt bears interest at fixed rates.
    Therefore, an immediate 100 basis point increase in
    interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect
    on Applied’s near-term financial condition or results of
    operations.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign
    currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss
    francs. Applied enters into forward exchange and currency option
    contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and
    anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected
    to occur typically within 24 months. Gains and losses on
    these contracts are generally recognized in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations at the time that the related
    transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of
    movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and
    currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect
    on the underlying items being hedged, these financial
    instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that
    would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates.
    Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes.

Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency
    as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen, euro,
    Israeli shekel and Swiss francs), and the terms of the forward
    exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying
    transactions. Applied’s outstanding forward exchange
    contracts are

marked-to-market

as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being
    hedged; therefore, the effect of exchange rate changes on
    forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially
    offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying



transactions. The effect of an immediate 10 percent change
    in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the
    underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to
    Applied’s near-term financial condition or results of
    operations. Applied’s risk with respect to currency option
    contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to
    exercise the option. Premiums paid for options outstanding at
    October 25, 2009 were not material. For further details,
    see Note 3 and Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated
    Condensed Financial Statements.

Disclosure
    Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, management
    of Applied conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and
    with the participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer
    and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design
    and operation of Applied’s disclosure controls and
    procedures, as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based
    upon that evaluation, Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer concluded that Applied’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
    period covered by this report in ensuring that information
    required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that
    information required to be disclosed by Applied in such reports
    is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
    management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

Management’s
    Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

Applied’s management is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, management of Applied conducted an
    evaluation of the effectiveness of Applied’s internal
    control over financial reporting based upon the framework in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, Applied’s
    management concluded that Applied’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of October 25, 2009.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
    audited the consolidated financial statements included in this

Form 10-K

and, as part of the audit, has issued a report, included herein,
    on the effectiveness of Applied’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of October 25, 2009.

Changes
    in Internal Control over Financial Reporting

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2009, there were no changes
    in the internal control over financial reporting that materially
    affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
    Applied’s internal control over financial reporting.

Inherent
    Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures and Internal
    Control over Financial Reporting

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well
    designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not
    absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be
    met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in
    part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
    events.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries’
    (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of
    October 25, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to
    express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other
    procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We
    believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our
    opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries
    maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 25, 2009, based on
    criteria established in I

nternal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Applied Materials Inc. and
    subsidiaries as of October 25, 2009 and October 26,
    2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations,
    stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and
    cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
    October 25, 2009. In connection with our audits of the
    consolidated financial statements, we have also audited the
    financial statement schedule II. Our report dated
    December 11, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule.

2000 Global Equity Incentive Plan

The 2000 Global Equity
    Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan) was adopted effective as of
    June 21, 2000. The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of
    non-qualified stock options to employees other than officers and
    directors. The administrator of the 2000 Plan (either the Board
    of Directors of Applied or a committee appointed by the Board)
    determines the terms and conditions of all stock options
    granted; provided, however, that (1) the exercise price
    generally may not be less than 100 percent of the fair
    market value (on the date of grant) of the stock covered by the
    option, and (2) the term of options can be no longer than
    10 years (or 13 years in the event of death). A total
    of 147,000,000 shares have been authorized for issuance
    under the 2000 Plan, and 47,955 shares remain available for
    issuance as of October 25, 2009.

Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees

The Stock
    Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees (the Offshore ESPP) was
    adopted effective as of October 16, 1995 for the benefit of
    employees of Applied’s participating affiliates (other than
    United States citizens or residents). The Offshore ESPP provides
    for the grant of options to purchase shares of Applied common
    stock through payroll deductions pursuant to one or more
    offerings. The administrator of the Offshore ESPP (the Board of
    Directors of Applied or a committee appointed by the Board)
    determines the terms and conditions of all options prior to the
    start of an offering, including the purchase price of shares,
    the number of shares covered by the option and when the option
    may be exercised. All options granted as part of an offering
    must be granted on the same date. Prior to June 8, 2009, a



total of 12,800,000 shares had been authorized for issuance
    under the Offshore ESPP. Effective June 8, 2009, Applied
    amended the Offshore ESPP to increase the number of shares
    available for issuance under such plan by 3,000,000 shares
    and correspondingly amended the stockholder-approved Applied
    Materials, Inc. Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan (the
    U.S. ESPP) to reduce the number of shares available for
    issuance under such plan by 3,000,000 shares. Accordingly,
    as of October 25, 2009 a total of 15,800,000 shares
    have been authorized for issuance under the Offshore ESPP, and
    2,033,000 shares remain available for issuance. These plan
    amendments did not result in any increase in the total aggregate
    number of shares authorized for issuance under the Offshore ESPP
    and the U.S. ESPP.

Nonemployee Director Share Purchase Plan

The Applied
    Materials, Inc. Nonemployee Director Share Purchase Plan was
    adopted effective March 22, 2005. The Nonemployee Director
    Share Purchase Plan provides a method by which non-employee
    directors may purchase Applied common stock at 100% of fair
    market value on the purchase date by foregoing cash they have
    earned as retainer fees or meeting fees. The shares generally
    are purchased at the same time the directors otherwise would
    have been paid the fees in cash. Since the directors pay full
    fair market value for the shares, there is no reserved amount of
    shares under this plan and, accordingly, the table above does
    not include any set number of shares available for future
    issuance under the plan.

Applied Materials Profit Sharing Scheme

The Applied
    Materials Profit Sharing Scheme was adopted effective
    July 3, 1996 to enable employees of Applied Materials
    Ireland Limited and its participating subsidiaries to purchase
    Applied common stock at 100% of fair market value on the
    purchase date. Under this plan, eligible employees may elect to
    forego a certain portion of their base salary and certain
    bonuses they have earned and that otherwise would be payable in
    cash to purchase shares of Applied common stock at full fair
    market value. Since the eligible employees pay full fair market
    value for the shares, there is no reserved amount of shares
    under this plan and, accordingly, the table above does not
    include any set number of shares available for future issuance
    under the plan.

APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles
    of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
    Applied Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied or the
    Company) after elimination of intercompany balances and
    transactions. All references to a fiscal year apply to
    Applied’s fiscal year which ends on the last Sunday in
    October. Fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 contained 52 weeks
    each. Each fiscal quarter of 2009, 2008 and 2007 contained
    13 weeks.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    materially from those estimates.

Prior year amounts for customer deposits and deferred revenue
    have been reclassified to conform to the current year
    presentation.

During fiscal 2009, Applied implemented authoritative guidance
    and changed the measurement date for its defined and
    postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations from an
    interim date to Applied’s fiscal year end. Accordingly,
    Applied recorded a $2 million (after tax) adjustment to the
    fiscal 2009 beginning balance of retained earnings.

Cash
    Equivalents

All highly-liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three
    months or less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. Cash equivalents consists primarily of investments
    in institutional money market funds.

Investments

All of Applied’s investments are classified as

available-for-sale

at the respective balance sheet dates. Investments classified as

available-for-sale

are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and
    any temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an
    investment is presented as a separate component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income (loss). The specific identification
    method is used to determine the gains and losses on investments.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost
    determined on a

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis.

Property,
    Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is
    provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the
    straight-line method. Estimated useful lives for financial
    reporting purposes are as follows: buildings and improvements, 3
    to 30 years; demonstration and manufacturing equipment, 3
    to 5 years; software, 3 to 5 years; and furniture,
    fixtures and other equipment, 3 to 15 years. Land
    improvements are amortized over the shorter of 15 years or
    the estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the shorter of five years or the lease term.

Intangible
    Assets

Goodwill and indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are
    reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of
    each fiscal year. Purchased technology and other intangible
    assets are presented at cost, net of



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

accumulated amortization, and are amortized over their estimated
    useful lives of 1 to 15 years using the straight-line
    method.

Long-Lived
    Assets

Applied reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events
    or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of
    these assets may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these
    assets for impairment based on estimated future cash flows from
    these assets.

Research,
    Development and Engineering Costs

Research, development and engineering costs are expensed as
    incurred.

Advertising
    Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising costs
    were not material for all periods presented.

Sales and
    Value Added Taxes

Taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental
    authorities are presented on a net basis in the accompanying
    Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Income
    Taxes

Income tax expense is based on pretax earnings. Deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax
    consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax
    bases of recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses
    and tax credit carryforwards.

Revenue
    Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue when all four revenue recognition
    criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement
    exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered;
    seller’s price to buyer is fixed or determinable; and
    collectability is reasonably assured. Applied’s shipping
    terms are customarily FOB Applied shipping point or equivalent
    terms. Applied’s revenue recognition policy generally
    results in revenue recognition at the following points:
    (1) for all transactions where legal title passes to the
    customer upon shipment, Applied recognizes revenue upon shipment
    for all products that have been demonstrated to meet product
    specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue
    associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred
    based on the estimated fair value, and that revenue is
    recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks;
    (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet
    product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized
    at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions
    where legal title does not pass at shipment, revenue is
    recognized when legal title passes to the customer, which is
    generally at customer technical acceptance; and (4) for
    arrangements containing multiple elements, the revenue relating
    to the undelivered elements is deferred at their estimated
    relative fair values until delivery of the deferred elements. In
    cases where Applied has sold products that have been
    demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment,
    Applied believes that at the time of delivery, it has an
    enforceable claim to amounts recognized as revenue. The
    completed contract method is used for
    SunFab

tm

Thin Film Lines. Certain SunFab Thin Film contracts have
    provisions for additional amounts to become due to Applied if
    the line achieves certain output criteria subsequent to factory
    acceptance. Any additional amounts earned under these contracts
    are recognized upon achievement. Spare parts revenue is
    generally recognized upon shipment, and services revenue is
    generally recognized over the period that the services are
    provided.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Applied uses financial instruments, such as forward exchange and
    currency option contracts, to hedge a portion of, but not all,
    existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated
    transactions typically expected to occur within 24 months.
    The terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are
    generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being
    hedged. The purpose of Applied’s foreign currency
    management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate
    fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues,
    costs and eventual cash flows. All of Applied’s derivative
    financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon
    quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative
    instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of
    anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions, the
    effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is
    reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) in stockholders’ equity, and is reclassified
    into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If
    the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of
    any derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the
    associated financial instrument is recorded promptly in
    earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge existing
    foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or
    loss on these hedges is recorded promptly in earnings to offset
    the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being
    hedged. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments
    for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign
    Currency Translation

As of October 25, 2009, primarily all of Applied’s
    subsidiaries use the United States dollar as their functional
    currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these
    subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in effect at
    the end of the period, except for non-monetary assets, such as
    inventories and property, plant and equipment, which are
    translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs
    are translated using average exchange rates for the period,
    except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are
    translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting
    translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations as incurred.

Concentrations
    of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject Applied to
    significant concentrations of credit risk consist principally of
    cash equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable and
    derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.
    Applied invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as,
    but not limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate and
    municipal bonds, United States Treasury and agency securities,
    and asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, and, by policy,
    limits the amount of credit exposure with any one financial
    institution or commercial issuer. Applied performs ongoing
    credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition
    and generally requires no collateral to secure accounts
    receivable. Applied maintains an allowance reserve for
    potentially uncollectible accounts receivable based on its
    assessment of the collectibility of accounts receivable. Applied
    regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as
    historical experience, credit quality, age of the accounts
    receivable balances, and current economic conditions that may
    affect a customer’s ability to pay. In addition, Applied
    utilizes letters of credit to mitigate credit risk when
    considered appropriate. Applied is exposed to credit-related
    losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to
    derivative financial instruments, but does not expect any
    counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.

Equity-Based
    Compensation

Applied has adopted stock plans that permit grants to employees
    of equity-based awards, including stock options, restricted
    stock and restricted stock units (also referred to as
    “performance shares” under the Applied Materials, Inc.
    Employee Stock Incentive Plan). In addition, the Employee Stock
    Incentive Plan provides for the automatic grant of restricted
    stock units to non-employee directors and permits the grant of
    equity-based awards to consultants. Applied also has an Employee
    Stock Purchase Plan for United States employees, and a second



APPLIED

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Employee Stock Purchase Plan for international employees
    (collectively, ESPP), which enable eligible employees to
    purchase Applied common stock.

During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, Applied recognized total
    equity-based compensation expense related to stock options, ESPP
    shares, restricted stock units and restricted stock of
    $147 million (or $0.08 per diluted share),
    $179 million (or $0.09 per diluted share) and
    $161 million (or $0.08 per diluted share), respectively.
    During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, Applied recognized income tax
    benefits related to equity-based compensation of
    $41 million, $50 million and $45 million,
    respectively. The equity-based compensation expense related to
    restricted stock units and restricted stock for fiscal 2009,
    2008 and 2007 was $115 million, $137 million and
    $104 million, respectively. The cost associated with
    Applied’s stock options and restricted stock units less
    expected forfeitures, is recognized over the awards’
    service period for the entire award on a straight-line basis.
    The cost associated with Applied’s performance-based equity
    awards are recognized over the service for each tranche.

Stock
    Options

The exercise price of each stock option equals the fair market
    value of Applied common stock on the date of grant. Most options
    are scheduled to vest over four years and expire no later than
    seven years from the grant date. The fair value of each option
    grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
    option pricing model. This model was developed for use in
    estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no
    vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. Applied’s
    employee stock options have characteristics significantly
    different from those of publicly traded options. The weighted
    average assumptions used in the model are outlined in the
    following table:

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on a
    combination of historical and implied volatilities. When
    establishing the expected life assumption, Applied periodically
    reviews historical employee exercise behavior with respect to
    option grants with similar vesting periods.

Options outstanding had an aggregate intrinsic value of
    $109 million, $0.6 million and $190 million at
    October 25, 2009, October 26, 2008 and
    October 28, 2007, respectively. The total grant date fair
    value of options granted during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    $62 million, $34,000 and $2 million, respectively. The
    total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal 2009,
    2008 and 2007 was $1 million, $54 million and
    $141 million, respectively. The total fair value of options
    that vested during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was
    $14 million, $55 million and $124 million,
    respectively. At October 25, 2009, Applied had
    $42 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net
    of estimated forfeitures, related to stock option plans that
    will be recognized over the weighted average period of
    1.3 years. Cash received from stock option exercises was
    $9 million, $328 million and $837 million,
    respectively, during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007. The actual tax
    benefit realized for the tax deductions from options exercised
    for fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 totaled $22 million,
    $57 million and $50 million, respectively.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase Applied
    common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to
    85 percent of the lower of the fair market value of Applied
    common stock at the beginning of the applicable offering period
    or at the end of each applicable purchase period. Effective
    March 2, 2009, the length of offering periods under the
    ESPP was reduced to 6 months from a maximum of
    24 months in duration. The

incremental compensation cost associated with this modification
    was insignificant. The number of shares issued under the ESPP
    during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was 6,920,000 shares,
    4,617,000 shares and 4,310,000 shares, respectively.
    Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted
    average estimated fair value of purchase rights under the ESPP
    was $3.19 per share for the year ended October 25, 2009,
    $4.97 per share for the year ended October 26, 2008 and
    $4.83 per share for the year ended October 28, 2007.
    Compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of the
    employees’ purchase rights under the Black-Scholes model.

Restricted
    Stock Units and Restricted Stock

Restricted stock units are converted into shares of Applied
    common stock upon vesting on a

one-for-one

basis. Restricted stock units typically vest over three to four
    years. Vesting of restricted stock units usually is subject to
    the grantee’s continued service with Applied. The
    compensation expense related to these awards is determined using
    the fair value of Applied common stock on the date of the grant,
    and compensation is recognized over the vesting period. At
    October 25, 2009, Applied had $136 million total
    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to restricted stock unit grants, which will be
    recognized over the weighted average period of 1.2 years
    (see Note 10).

Beginning in fiscal 2007, Applied initiated a performance-based
    equity award program for named executive officers and other key
    employees. These awards vest only if specific performance goals
    set by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of
    Applied’s Board of Directors (the Committee) are achieved
    and if the grantee remains employed by Applied through the
    applicable vesting date. The performance goals require the
    achievement of targeted relative annual operating profit margin
    levels as compared to Applied’s peer companies in at least
    one of the four fiscal years beginning with the fiscal year of
    the grant. There were no performance-based awards granted in
    fiscal 2009. The Committee approved grants of 1,565,000 and
    1,950,000 performance-based restricted stock units under this
    program for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively. The
    Committee also approved the issuance to Applied’s President
    and Chief Executive Officer of performance-based restricted
    stock in the amounts of 100,000 and 150,000 shares for
    fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007, respectively, at $0.01 per share.
    The fair value of the performance-based restricted stock units
    and restricted stock is estimated using the fair market value of
    Applied common stock on the date of the grant and assumes that
    the performance goals will be achieved. If achieved, the award
    vests over a specified remaining service period. If the
    performance goals are not met, no compensation expense is
    recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is
    reversed. The expected cost of each award is reflected over the
    service period and is reduced for estimated forfeitures. As of
    October 25, 2009, 70% of the performance goals associated
    with the fiscal 2008 awards were achieved. The performance goals
    associated with the remaining 30% may still be achieved,
    depending on future performance, during fiscal 2010. The
    performance goals associated with the fiscal 2007 awards were
    achieved prior to fiscal 2009. Fiscal 2009 equity-based
    compensation expense included $13 million attributable to
    the performance-based awards granted in fiscal 2008 and fiscal
    2007. Fiscal 2008 equity-based compensation expense included
    $21 million attributable to the performance-based awards
    granted in fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2007 equity-based
    compensation expense included $13 million attributable to
    the performance-based awards granted in fiscal 2007.

Earnings
    Per Share

Basic earnings (loss) per share is determined using the weighted
    average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
    Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted
    average number of common shares and potential common shares
    (representing the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted
    stock units, and ESPP shares) outstanding during the period.
    Applied’s net income (loss) has not been adjusted for any
    period presented for purposes of computing basic or diluted
    earnings (loss) per share due to the Company’s non-complex
    capital structure.

For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted
    average potential common shares do not include stock options
    with an exercise price greater than the average fair market
    value of Applied common stock for the period, as the effect
    would be anti-dilutive. Accordingly, options to purchase
    36,423,000 and 51,094,000 shares of common stock for the
    fiscal years ended October 26, 2008 and October 28,
    2007, respectively, were excluded from the computation.
    Potential common shares have not been included in the
    calculation of diluted net loss per share for the year ended
    October 25, 2009, as the effect would be anti-dilutive. As
    such, the numerator and the denominator used in computing both
    basic and diluted net loss per share for fiscal 2009 are the
    same. The number of potential common shares that were excluded
    from the computation of diluted earnings per share was
    85,049,000 for fiscal 2009.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for
    revenue recognition with multiple deliverables. This
    authoritative guidance impacts the determination of when the
    individual deliverables included in a multiple-element
    arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting.
    Additionally, this guidance modifies the manner in which the
    transaction consideration is allocated across the separately
    identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual
    method of allocating arrangement consideration. Applied will
    adopt this authoritative guidance prospectively commencing in
    its first quarter of fiscal 2010. The implementation is not
    expected to have a material impact on Applied’s financial
    position or results of operations.

In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for the
    accounting for certain revenue arrangements that include
    software elements. This authoritative guidance amends the scope
    of pre-existing software revenue guidance by removing from the
    guidance non-software components of tangible products and
    certain software components of tangible products. Applied will
    adopt this authoritative guidance prospectively commencing in
    its first quarter of fiscal 2010. The implementation is not
    expected to have a material impact on Applied’s financial
    position or results of operations.

In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on variable
    interest entities, which becomes effective the first annual
    reporting period after November 15, 2009 and will be
    effective for Applied in fiscal 2011. This authoritative
    guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities
    represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of
    control over such entities, and additional disclosures for
    variable interests. Applied is evaluating the potential impact
    of the implementation of this authoritative guidance on its
    consolidated financial statements.

In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on
    accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
    business combination that arise from contingencies, which amends
    the provisions related to the initial recognition and
    measurement, subsequent measurement and disclosure of assets and
    liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination
    under previously issued guidance. The authoritative guidance
    requires that such contingencies be recognized at fair value on
    the acquisition date if fair value can be reasonably estimated
    during the allocation period. This authoritative guidance will
    be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010. Applied expects that
    this authoritative guidance will have an impact on its
    consolidated financial statements, but the nature and magnitude
    of the specific effects will depend upon the nature, term and
    size of the acquired contingencies.



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

In December 2008, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on
    employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined
    benefit pension or other postretirement plan. Applied will
    comply with this authoritative guidance in fiscal 2010.

In December 2007, the FASB revised the authoritative guidance on
    business combinations, including the measurement of acquirer
    shares issued in consideration for a business combination, the
    recognition of contingent consideration, the accounting for
    preacquisition gain and loss contingencies, the recognition of
    capitalized in-process research and development, the accounting
    for acquisition-related restructuring cost accruals, the
    treatment of acquisition-related transaction costs, and the
    recognition of changes in the acquirer’s income tax
    valuation allowance. This authoritative guidance will be
    effective for Applied in fiscal 2010, with early adoption
    prohibited. Applied expects that this authoritative guidance
    will have an impact on its consolidated financial statements,
    but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend
    upon the nature, terms and size of the acquisitions it
    consummates after the effective date.

In December 2007, the FASB issued authoritative guidance on
    noncontrolling interests, which changes the accounting for
    noncontrolling (minority) interests in consolidated financial
    statements, including the requirements to classify
    noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated
    stockholders’ equity, and the elimination of “minority
    interest” accounting in results of operations with earnings
    attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of
    consolidated earnings. Additionally, this authoritative guidance
    revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a
    parent’s controlling ownership interest. This authoritative
    guidance will be effective for Applied in fiscal 2010, with
    early adoption prohibited. Applied is evaluating the potential
    impact of the implementation of this authoritative guidance on
    its financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for
    fair value measurements, which defines fair value, establishes a
    framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about
    fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued
    authoritative guidance on fair value measurements for purposes
    of lease classification, which amends previously issued guidance
    on fair value measurements to remove certain leasing
    transactions from its scope. The FASB also issued authoritative
    guidance on the effective date of fair value measurements, which
    delays the effective date for Applied for all non-financial
    assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are
    recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial
    statements on a recurring basis (at least annually), until the
    beginning of Applied’s first quarter of fiscal 2010. The
    measurement and disclosure requirements related to financial
    assets and financial liabilities were effective for Applied
    beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2009. In October 2008,
    the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the
    application of fair value measurements in a market that is not
    active, and provides guidance on the key considerations in
    determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market
    for that financial asset is not active. Applied adopted the
    effective portions of fair value measurements beginning in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2009. See Note 3 for information
    and related disclosures regarding Applied’s fair value
    measurements.

Note 2

Treasury
    Stock

Applied records treasury stock purchases under the cost method
    using the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method. Upon reissuance of treasury stock,
    amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to
    additional paid in capital. If Applied reissues treasury stock
    at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid in
    capital associated with prior treasury stock transactions is
    insufficient to cover the difference between the acquisition
    cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against
    retained earnings. During fiscal 2009, shares of treasury stock
    were issued in connection with Applied’s ESPP at an
    aggregate value that was less than the treasury stock’s
    acquisition price, resulting in $40 million being recorded
    against retained earnings.

At October 25, 2009, Applied had a gross unrealized loss of
    $1 million due to a decrease in the fair value of certain
    fixed income securities. Applied regularly reviews its
    investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments that
    have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered in
    determining whether a loss is temporary include: the length of
    time and extent to which fair value has been lower than the cost
    basis; the financial condition, credit quality and near-term
    prospects of the investee; and whether it is more likely than
    not that Applied will be required to sell the security prior to
    recovery. Generally, the contractual terms of the investments do
    not permit settlement at prices less than the amortized cost of
    the investments. In fiscal 2009, Applied recognized an
    impairment of its marketable securities in the amount of
    $2 million. Applied has determined that the gross
    unrealized losses on its investments at October 25, 2009
    are temporary in nature. Accordingly, Applied does not consider
    the investments to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired at October 25, 2009.

Applied manages its cash equivalents and investments, excluding
    strategic investments, as a single portfolio of highly
    marketable securities that is intended to be available to meet
    Applied’s current cash requirements. For fiscal 2009, gross
    realized gains on sales of investments were $9 million, and
    gross realized losses were $10 million. For fiscal 2008,
    gross realized gains on sales of investments were
    $13 million, and gross realized losses were
    $15 million. For fiscal 2007, gross realized gains on sales
    of investments were $2 million, and gross realized losses
    were $2 million.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

On October 27, 2008, Applied adopted authoritative guidance
    for fair value measurements and the fair value option for
    financial assets and liabilities. This authoritative guidance
    defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair
    value and enhances disclosure requirements for fair value
    measurements. Fair value is defined under this authoritative
    guidance as the exchange price that would be received for an
    asset, or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price), in the
    principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability
    in an orderly transaction between market participants on the
    measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair
    value under this guidance must maximize the use of observable
    inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. This
    authoritative guidance describes a fair value hierarchy based on
    three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered
    observable and the last is considered unobservable, which may be
    used to measure fair value:

•

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for
    identical assets or liabilities;

•

Level 2 — Observable inputs other than
    Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly,
    such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted
    prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are
    observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for
    substantially the full term of the assets or
    liabilities; and

•

Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported
    by little or no market activity and that are significant to the
    fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Applied’s investments are comprised primarily of debt
    securities that are classified as

available-for-sale

and recorded at their fair value. In determining the fair value
    of investments, Applied uses pricing information from pricing
    services that value securities based on quoted market prices and
    models that utilize observable market inputs. In the event a
    fair value estimate is unavailable from a pricing service,
    Applied generally obtains non-binding price quotes from brokers.
    Applied then reviews the information provided by the pricing
    services or brokers to determine the fair value of its
    short-term and long-term investments. In addition, to validate
    pricing information obtained from pricing services, Applied
    periodically performs supplemental analysis on a sample of
    securities. Applied reviews any significant unanticipated
    differences identified through this analysis to determine the
    appropriate fair value.

In general, investments with remaining effective maturities of
    12 months or less from the balance sheet date are
    classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining
    effective maturities of more than 12 months from the
    balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments. As
    of October 25, 2009, a substantial majority of
    Applied’s

available-for-sale,

short-term and long-term investments were recognized at fair
    value that was determined based upon observable inputs.

Unrealized gains and temporary losses on investments classified
    as

available-for-sale

are included within accumulated other comprehensive income
    (loss), net of any related tax effect. Upon realization, those
    amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss) to results of operations.

Financial
    Assets/Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring
    Basis

Equity investments in privately-held companies are generally
    accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are
    periodically assessed for

other-than-temporary

impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an

other-than-temporary

decline in value may have occurred. If Applied determines that
    an

other-than-temporary

impairment has occurred, the investment will be written down to
    its estimated fair value based on available information, such as
    pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions,
    earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance
    and any other readily available market data. Equity investments
    in privately-held companies totaled $91 million at
    October 25, 2009, of which $52 million of investments
    were accounted for under the cost method of accounting and
    $39 million of investments had been measured at fair value
    on a non-recurring basis during fiscal 2009 due to an

other-than-temporary

decline in value. The following table presents the balance of

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

Derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign
    currency exchange contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet
    at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do
    not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective
    portion of any hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All
    of Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded
    at their fair value in other current assets or accounts payable
    and accrued expenses.

Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with
    certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as
    Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Swiss francs. The purpose
    of Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the
    effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
    denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The terms
    of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally
    consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged.
    Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes.

Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward
    exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge
    certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions
    expected to occur typically within the next 24 months.
    Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and
    documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and
    are typically entered into once per month. Cash flow hedges are
    evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of
    the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of
    accumulated other comprehensive income or loss (AOCI) in
    stockholders’ equity and is reclassified into earnings when
    the hedged transaction affects earnings. The majority of the
    after-tax net income or loss related to derivative instruments
    included in AOCI at October 25, 2009 is expected to be
    reclassified into earnings within 12 months. Changes in the
    fair value of currency forward exchange and option contracts due
    to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of
    effectiveness. Both ineffective hedge amounts and hedge
    components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are
    recognized promptly in earnings. If the transaction being hedged
    is no longer probable to occur, or if a portion of any
    derivative is deemed to be ineffective, Applied promptly
    recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial
    instrument in general and administrative expenses. The amount
    recognized due to discontinuance of cash flow hedges that were
    probable not to occur by the end of the originally specified
    time period was $25 million for the fiscal 2009. The amount
    recognized due to discontinuance of cash flow hedges that were
    probable not to occur by the end of the originally specified
    time period was not significant for fiscal 2008 or 2007.

Forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain
    foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. These
    derivatives are typically entered into once per month and are
    not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly,
    changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded promptly
    in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the
    assets or liabilities being hedged.

Credit
    Risk Contingent Features

If Applied’s credit rating were to fall below investment
    grade, it would be in violation of credit risk contingent
    provisions, and certain counterparties to the derivative
    instruments could request immediate payment on derivative
    instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value
    of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related
    contingent features that were in a liability position was
    immaterial as of October 25, 2009.

Entering into foreign exchange contracts with banks exposes
    Applied to credit-related losses in the event of the banks’
    nonperformance. However, Applied’s exposure is not
    considered significant.

For further details, see Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated
    Condensed Financial Statements.

Fair
    Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of Applied’s financial instruments,
    including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes
    payable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate
    fair value due to the short maturities of these financial
    instruments. At October 25, 2009, the carrying amount of
    long-term debt was $202 million and the estimated fair
    value was $216 million. At October 26, 2008, the
    carrying amount of long-term debt was $203 million and the
    estimated fair value was $198 million. The estimated fair
    value of long-term debt is determined by Level 2 inputs and
    is based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or
    similar issues.

Goodwill,
    Purchased Technology and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill
    and Purchased Intangible Assets

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful
    lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment
    annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. For goodwill,
    Applied performs a two-step



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

impairment test. In the first step, Applied compares the
    estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying
    value. Applied’s reporting units are consistent with the
    reportable segments identified in Note 12, based on the
    manner in which Applied operates its business and the nature of
    those operations. Applied determines the fair value of each of
    its reporting units based on a weighting of income and market
    approaches. Under the income approach, Applied calculates the
    fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of
    estimated future cash flows. Under the market approach, Applied
    estimates the fair value based on market multiples of revenue or
    earnings for comparable companies. If the fair value of the
    reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets
    assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further
    testing is performed. If the carrying value of the net assets
    assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the
    reporting unit, then Applied would perform the second step of
    the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value
    of the reporting unit’s goodwill. Applied would then
    allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the
    assets and liabilities of that unit, as if Applied had acquired
    the reporting unit in a business combination, with the fair
    value of the reporting unit being the “purchase
    price”. The excess of the “purchase price” over
    the carrying amounts assigned to assets and liabilities
    representing the implied fair value of goodwill. If Applied
    determined that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s
    goodwill exceeded its implied fair value, Applied would record
    an impairment loss equal to the difference.

Applied conducted these impairment tests in the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2009, and the results of these tests indicated that
    Applied’s goodwill and purchased intangible assets with
    indefinite useful lives were not impaired.

Applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price
    relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through
    established and generally accepted valuation techniques.
    Goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of the
    acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and
    identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities
    assumed. Applied assigns assets acquired (including goodwill)
    and liabilities assumed to a reporting unit as of the date of
    acquisition. Typically, acquisitions relate to a single
    reporting unit and thus do not require the allocation of
    goodwill to multiple reporting units. If the products obtained
    in an acquisition are assigned to multiple reporting units, the
    goodwill is distributed to the respective reporting units as
    part of the purchase price allocation process.

From October 26, 2008 to October 25, 2009, goodwill
    decreased by $4 million primarily due to an adjustment in
    the purchase price allocation of an acquisition as a result of a
    change in estimate of Applied’s ability to utilize tax net
    operating loss carryforwards associated with this acquisition.
    Other intangible assets that are not subject to amortization
    consist primarily of a trade name. As of October 25, 2009,
    indefinite-lived intangible assets by reportable segment were:
    Energy and Environmental Solutions, $654 million; Silicon,
    $224 million; Applied Global Services, $195 million;
    and Display, $116 million.

Finite-Lived
    Purchased Intangible Assets

Applied amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives
    using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives
    of the assets, ranging from 1 to 15 years.

Applied evaluates long-lived assets, such as property, plant and
    equipment, and purchased intangible assets with finite lives,
    for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
    indicate the carrying value of an asset



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

group may not be recoverable. Applied assesses the fair value of
    the assets based on the amount of the undiscounted future cash
    flow that the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an
    impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow
    expected to result from the use of the asset, plus net proceeds
    expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than
    the carrying value of the asset. When Applied identifies an
    impairment, Applied reduces the carrying value of the group of
    assets to comparable market values, when available and
    appropriate, or to its estimated fair value based on a
    discounted cash flow approach.

Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally
    recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value
    assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and
    judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle
    of products and technology acquired. Applied evaluates the
    useful lives of its intangible assets each reporting period to
    determine whether events and circumstances require revising the
    remaining period of amortization. In addition, Applied reviews
    intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in
    circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be
    recoverable. Management considers such indicators as significant
    differences in actual product acceptance from the estimates,
    changes in the competitive and economic environment,
    technological advances, and changes in cost structure.

    2007, respectively. As of October 25, 2009, future
    estimated amortization expense is expected to be
    $65 million for fiscal 2010, $52 million for fiscal
    2011, $47 million for fiscal 2012, $43 million for fiscal
    2013, $39 million for fiscal 2014, and $42 million
    thereafter. As of October 25, 2009, amortized intangible
    assets by reportable segment were: Energy and Environmental
    Solutions, $211 million; Applied Global Services,
    $42 million; Display, $29 million; and Silicon,
    $7 million.

Note 6

Borrowing
    Facilities

Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in
    various currencies of up to $1.2 billion, of which
    $1.0 billion is comprised of a

5-year

revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is
    scheduled to expire in January 2012. This agreement provides for
    borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to
    one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance and
    includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in
    compliance at October 25, 2009. In May 2009, Applied
    amended certain terms of this credit agreement, including
    (i) replacing the funded-debt-to-adjusted-earnings ratio
    financial covenant with a minimum liquidity covenant and a
    funded-debt-to-total-capital ratio covenant and
    (ii) increasing the facility fee and applicable interest
    rate margins on advances. Remaining credit facilities in the
    amount of approximately $165 million are with Japanese
    banks. Applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities
    is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing
    request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the
    banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. No
    amounts were outstanding under any of the above credit
    facilities at October 25, 2009.

    minimum financial ratios. At October 25, 2009, Applied was
    in compliance with all such covenants. Aggregate debt maturities
    at October 25, 2009 were: $1 million in fiscal 2010,
    $1 million in fiscal 2011, and $200 million thereafter.

Restructuring
    and Asset Impairments

During the first quarter of fiscal 2009, Applied announced a
    restructuring program to reduce its global workforce by
    approximately 1,800 positions. During the second quarter of
    fiscal 2009, Applied expanded the scope of the restructuring
    program by approximately 200 positions. During fiscal 2009,
    Applied recognized restructuring and asset impairment charges of
    $156 million, primarily consisting of $143 million in
    restructuring charges associated with this program and
    $15 million in asset impairments. The restructuring charges
    consisted of employee-related costs to reduce the Company’s
    workforce through a combination of attrition, voluntary
    separation and other workforce reduction programs. During fiscal
    2008, Applied recognized restructuring charges of
    $40 million, of which $29 million was associated with
    a global cost reduction plan announced in fiscal 2008, and
    $11 million with a plan announced in fiscal 2007. During
    fiscal 2007, Applied recognized restructuring and asset
    impairment charges of $26 million. The fiscal 2007 charge
    consisted of $21 million in restructuring charges and
    $9 million in asset impairments, associated with the
    decision to cease development of beamline implant products,
    offset by adjustment to restructuring reserves.

Stock
    Repurchase Program

On September 15, 2006, Applied’s Board of Directors
    approved a stock repurchase program for up to $5.0 billion
    in repurchases over the three years ending in September 2009.
    Under this authorization, Applied implemented a systematic stock
    repurchase program and also made supplemental repurchases of its
    common stock from time to time in the open market, depending on
    market conditions, stock price and other factors, for a total of
    $2.7 billion. In November 2008, Applied announced that it
    was suspending stock repurchases in light of uncertain

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

global economic and market conditions. In fiscal 2009, prior to
    such suspension, Applied repurchased 1,942,000 shares of
    its common stock at an average price of $11.80 per share for a
    total cash outlay of $23 million. In fiscal 2008, Applied
    repurchased 83,163,000 shares of its common stock at an
    average price of $18.04 per share for a total cash outlay of
    $1.5 billion. In fiscal 2007, Applied repurchased
    60,561,000 shares of its common stock at an average price
    of $19.81 per share for a total cash outlay of $1.3 billion.

Dividends

During fiscal 2009, Applied’s Board of Directors declared
    four quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share
    each quarter. The fourth quarterly cash dividend declared in
    fiscal 2009 was paid on December 3, 2009 to stockholders of
    record as of November 12, 2009. During fiscal 2008,
    Applied’s Board of Directors declared four quarterly cash
    dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each. During fiscal
    2007, Applied’s Board of Directors declared one quarterly
    cash dividend in the amount of $0.05 per share and three
    quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.06 per share each.
    Dividends declared during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 amounted to
    $320 million, $325 million and $306 million,
    respectively. Applied currently anticipates that it will
    continue to pay cash dividends on a quarterly basis in the
    future, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is
    at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on
    Applied’s financial condition, results of operations,
    capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as
    well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best
    interest of Applied’s stockholders.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

Applied sponsors two Employee Stock Purchase Plans
    (collectively, ESPP) for the benefit of United States (U.S.) and
    international employees, respectively. The U.S. plan is
    qualified under Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
    Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase Applied
    common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to
    85 percent of the lower of the fair market value of Applied
    common stock at the beginning of the applicable offering period
    or at the end of each applicable purchase period. Effective
    March 2, 2009, the length of offering periods under the
    ESPP was reduced to 6 months, from a maximum of
    24 months in duration. The incremental compensation cost
    associated with this modification was insignificant. ESPP
    contributions are limited to a maximum of 10 percent of an
    employee’s eligible compensation, up to a maximum of $6,500
    per six-month purchase period. ESPP participants are also
    limited to purchasing a maximum of 1,000 shares per
    purchase period. Shares issued under the ESPP were 6,920,000 for
    fiscal 2009, 4,617,000 for fiscal 2008, and 4,310,000 for fiscal
    2007. At October 25, 2009, there were
    64,822,000 shares available for future issuance under the
    ESPP.

Employee
    Bonus Plans

Applied has various employee bonus plans. A discretionary bonus
    plan provides for the distribution of a percentage of pre-tax
    profits to Applied employees who are not eligible for other
    performance-based incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of
    eligible compensation. Other plans award annual bonuses to
    Applied’s executives and other key contributors based on
    the achievement of profitability

and/or

other
    specified performance criteria. There were no charges to expense
    under these plans for fiscal 2009. Charges to expense under
    these plans were $150 million for fiscal 2008 and
    $271 million for fiscal 2007.

Employee
    Savings and Retirement Plan

Applied’s Employee Savings and Retirement Plan (401(k)
    Plan) is qualified under Sections 401(a) and (k) of
    the Internal Revenue Code. Eligible employees may make salary
    deferral and

catch-up

contributions under the 401(k) Plan on a pre-tax basis. Applied
    matches a percentage of each participant’s salary deferral
    contributions with cash contributions. In general, these
    matching contributions become 20 percent vested at the end
    of an employee’s second year of service with Applied, and
    vest 20 percent per year of service thereafter, becoming
    fully vested at the end of six years of service. Participants
    may direct that funds held in their 401(k) Plan accounts,
    including any Applied matching contributions, be invested in any
    of the diversified investment funds available under the 401(k)
    Plan or in the Applied Materials, Inc. Common Stock Fund (Stock
    Fund), which invests solely in shares of Applied common stock.
    Effective June 21, 2007, the Stock Fund was converted into
    a non-leveraged employee stock ownership plan (within the
    meaning of Section 4975(e)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code)
    and, as a result, participants have the option of specifying
    that any future cash dividends paid on shares held in the Stock
    Fund be either reinvested in the Stock Fund or distributed
    directly to them in cash no later than 90 days after the
    calendar year for which the dividends were paid. Applied’s
    matching contributions under this plan were approximately
    $24 million, net of $1 million in forfeitures, for
    fiscal 2009; $29 million, net of $2 million in
    forfeitures, for fiscal 2008; and $28 million, net of
    $1 million in forfeitures, for fiscal 2007.

Defined
    Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign Subsidiaries and Other
    Post-Retirement Benefits

Several of Applied’s foreign subsidiaries have defined
    benefit pension plans covering substantially all of their
    eligible employees. Benefits under these plans are typically
    based on years of service and final average compensation levels.
    The plans are managed in accordance with applicable local
    statutes and practices. Applied deposits funds for certain of
    these plans with insurance companies, pension trustees,
    government-managed accounts,

and/or

accrues the expense for the unfunded portion of the benefit
    obligation on its consolidated financial statements.
    Applied’s practice is to fund the various pension plans in
    amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements as
    established by applicable local governmental oversight and
    taxing authorities. Depending on the design of the plan, local
    custom and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may
    exceed qualified plan assets. The differences between the
    aggregate projected benefit obligations and aggregate plan
    assets of these plans have been recorded as liabilities by
    Applied and are included in accrued expenses and other
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In fiscal 2009,
    Applied changed the measurement date for its defined and
    postretirement benefit plan assets and obligations from an
    interim date to Applied’s fiscal year end.

On October 28, 2007, Applied implemented authoritative
    guidance that required Applied to recognize the funded status
    (the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the
    projected benefit obligations) of the defined benefit plan in
    the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with a corresponding adjustment
    to accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to
    measure the fair value of plan benefit obligations as of its
    fiscal year ending October 28, 2007 and to provide
    additional disclosures.

On January 1, 1999, Applied implemented a post-retirement
    plan that provides certain medical and vision benefits to
    eligible retirees who are at least age 55 and who have at
    least 10 years of service at their date of retirement. An
    eligible retiree may elect coverage for an eligible spouse or
    domestic partner who is not eligible for Medicare. Coverage
    under the plan generally ends for both the retiree and spouse or
    domestic partner upon becoming eligible for Medicare.
    Applied’s liability under this post-retirement plan, which
    was included in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, was $11 million at October 25, 2009
    and $9 million at October 26, 2008.

Applied’s investment strategy for its defined benefit plans
    is to invest assets in a prudent manner, maintaining
    well-diversified portfolios with the long-term objective of
    meeting the obligations of the plans as they come due. Asset
    allocation decisions are typically made by plan fiduciaries with
    input from Applied’s pension committee. Applied’s
    asset allocation strategy incorporates a sufficient equity
    exposure in order for the plans to benefit from the expected
    long-term outperformance of equities relative to the plans’
    liabilities. Applied retains investment managers, where
    appropriate, to manage the assets of the plans. Performance of
    investment managers is monitored by plan fiduciaries with the
    assistance of local investment consultants. The investment
    managers make investment decisions within the guidelines set
    forth by plan fiduciaries. Risk management practices include
    diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and
    periodic rebalancing toward target asset allocation ranges.
    Investment managers may use derivative instruments for efficient
    portfolio management purposes. Plan assets do not include any of
    Applied’s own equity or debt securities.

A summary of the components of net periodic benefit costs and
    the weighted average assumptions used for net periodic benefit
    cost and benefit obligation calculations for fiscal 2009, 2008
    and 2007 is presented below.

Asset return assumptions are derived based on actuarial and
    statistical methodologies, from analysis of long-term historical
    data relevant to the country in which each plan is in effect and
    the investments applicable to the corresponding plan. The
    discount rate for each plan was derived by reference to
    appropriate benchmark yields on high quality corporate bonds,
    allowing for the approximate duration of both plan obligations
    and the relevant benchmark yields.

Future expected benefit payments for the pension plans and the
    post-retirement plan over the next ten fiscal years are:
    $8 million in fiscal 2010, $9 million in fiscal 2011,
    $10 million in fiscal 2012, $10 million in fiscal
    2013,

    collectively for fiscal years 2015 through 2019. Company
    contributions to these plans for fiscal 2010 are expected to be
    approximately $10 million.

Executive
    Deferred Compensation Plans

Applied sponsors two unfunded deferred compensation plans, the
    Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (Predecessor EDCP) and the
    2005 Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (2005 EDCP), under
    which certain employees may elect to defer a portion of their
    following year’s eligible earnings. The Predecessor EDCP
    was frozen as of December 31, 2004 such that no new
    deferrals could be made under the plan after that date and the
    plan would qualify for “grandfather” relief under
    Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Predecessor
    EDCP participant accounts continue to be maintained under the
    plan and credited with deemed interest. The 2005 EDCP was
    implemented by Applied effective as of January 1, 2005 and
    is intended to comply with the requirements of Section 409A
    of the Internal Revenue Code. Amounts payable, including accrued
    deemed interest, totaled $77 million at October 25,
    2009 and $80 million at October 26, 2008, which were
    included in other long-term liabilities in the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets.

Current deferred tax liabilities are included in accounts

    and non-current deferred tax liabilities are included in other
    liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

A valuation allowance is recorded to reflect the estimated
    amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized. The
    valuation allowance has been established against capital loss
    carryforwards where it is believed that it is not more likely
    than not that sufficient capital gains will be realized within
    the remaining carryforward period.

For fiscal 2009, U.S. income taxes have not been provided
    for approximately $412 million of cumulative undistributed
    earnings of several

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Applied intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in
    operations outside of the U.S.

At October 25, 2009, Applied’s state net operating
    loss carryforwards were $152 million. The carryforwards
    expire between fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2029. Applied has a
    California research and development tax credit carryforward of
    $27 million which has an unlimited life. Applied has a
    foreign tax credit carryforward of $14 million which
    expires in fiscal 2019. Applied also has net operating loss
    carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions of $89 million. The
    carryforwards have lives ranging from five years to indefinite.
    Management believes it is more likely than not that all loss and
    tax credit carryforwards at October 25, 2009 will be
    utilized in future periods.

Applied’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax
    benefits associated with employee stock option transactions.
    These benefits, credited directly to stockholders’ equity,
    amounted to $0.4 million for fiscal 2009, $7 million
    for fiscal 2008, and $50 million for fiscal 2007 with a
    corresponding reduction to taxes payable of $0.4 million in
    fiscal 2009, $7 million in fiscal 2008, and
    $50 million for fiscal 2007.

Applied maintains liabilities for uncertain tax positions. These
    liabilities involve considerable judgment and estimation and are
    continuously monitored by management based on the best
    information available. A reconciliation of the beginning and
    ending balances of the total amounts of gross unrecognized tax
    benefits is as follows (in thousands):

Applied implemented new authoritative guidance for accounting
    for uncertain tax positions in the first quarter of fiscal 2008.
    In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Applied identified a tax
    position that met the more likely than not recognition
    threshold. Applied determined that a tax benefit of
    $100 million existed upon implementation of this

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

authoritative guidance and therefore made the correction to
    retained earnings. The impact of the correction was not
    considered material to prior reporting periods.

As of October 25, 2009, Applied had unrecognized tax
    benefits, net of federal deduction for state tax, of
    $325 million, all of which, if recognized, would result in
    a reduction of Applied’s effective tax rate.

As of October 25, 2009, the gross liability for
    unrecognized tax benefits was $325 million, exclusive of
    interest and penalties. Increases or decreases to interest and
    penalties on uncertain tax positions are included in provision
    for income taxes in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.
    Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions were
    $8 million as of October 26, 2008 and $5 million
    as of October 25, 2009. All $5 million in interest and
    penalties is classified as long-term liability in the
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. Long term income taxes payable has
    been reduced by certain unrecognized tax benefits.

During the second quarter of fiscal 2009, the Internal Revenue
    Service began an examination of Applied’s federal income
    tax returns for fiscal years 2007 and 2006. Applied believes it
    has adequately reserved for any income tax uncertainties that
    may arise as a result of this examination.

A number of Applied’s tax returns remain subject to
    examination by taxing authorities. These include
    U.S. federal returns for fiscal 2005 and later years,
    California returns for fiscal 2006 and later years, tax returns
    for certain states for fiscal 2002 and later years, and tax
    returns in certain jurisdictions outside of the U.S. for
    fiscal 2003 and later years.

During fiscal 2009, Applied received notice from the State of
    California stating that its examination of Applied’s
    returns for fiscal years 2002 through 2005 had been settled. The
    settlement resulted in a decrease to net unrecognized tax
    benefits of $14 million and reduced the effective tax rate
    for fiscal 2009.

The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is
    highly uncertain as well as the amounts and timing of various
    tax payments that may be part of the settlement process. This
    could cause large fluctuations in the balance sheet
    classification of current assets and non-current assets and
    liabilities. The Company does not expect a material change in
    unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.

Note 12

Industry
    Segment and Geographic Operations

Applied’s four reportable segments are: Silicon, Applied
    Global Services, Display, and Energy and Environmental
    Solutions. Applied’s chief operating decision-maker has
    been identified as the President and Chief Executive Officer,
    who reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating
    resources and assessing performance for the entire Company.
    Segment information is presented based upon Applied’s
    management organization structure as of October 25, 2009
    and the distinctive nature of each segment. Future changes to
    this internal financial structure may result in changes to the
    Company’s reportable segments.

Each reportable segment is separately managed and has separate
    financial results that are reviewed by Applied’s chief
    operating decision-maker. Each reportable segment contains
    closely related products that are unique to the particular
    segment. Segment operating income is determined based upon
    internal performance measures used by Applied’s chief
    operating decision-maker.

Applied derives the segment results directly from its internal
    management reporting system. The accounting policies Applied
    uses to derive reportable segment results are substantially the
    same as those used for external reporting purposes. Management
    measures the performance of each reportable segment based upon
    several metrics including orders, net sales and operating
    income. Management uses these results to evaluate the
    performance of, and to assign resources to, each of the
    reportable segments. Applied does not allocate to its reportable
    segments certain operating expenses that it manages separately
    at the corporate level, which include costs related to
    equity-based compensation and certain components of variable
    compensation, the global sales organization, corporate functions
    (certain management, finance, legal, human resources, marketing,
    and research, development and engineering), and unabsorbed
    information technology and occupancy. In addition, Applied does
    not allocate to



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

its reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment
    charges and any associated adjustments related to restructuring
    actions. Segment operating income excludes interest
    income/expense and other financial charges and income taxes
    according to how a particular reportable segment’s
    management is measured. Management does not consider the
    unallocated costs in measuring the performance of the reportable
    segments.

The Silicon segment includes semiconductor capital equipment for
    etch, rapid thermal processing, deposition, chemical mechanical
    planarization, and metrology and inspection.

The Applied Global Services segment includes technically
    differentiated products and services to improve operating
    efficiency, reduce operating costs and lessen the environmental
    impact of semiconductor, display and solar customers’
    factories. Applied Global Services’ products consist of
    spares, services, certain earlier generation products, and
    remanufactured equipment. Customer demand for these products and
    services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with
    trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer
    sites.

The Display segment encompasses products for manufacturing LCDs
    for TVs, personal computers and other video-enabled devices. The
    Display segment also includes the design and manufacture of
    differentiated stand-alone equipment for the Applied SunFab Thin
    Film Line.

The Energy and Environmental Solutions segment includes products
    for fabricating solar photovoltaic cells and modules, high
    throughput

roll-to-roll

coating systems for flexible electronics and web products, and
    systems used in the manufacture of energy-efficient glass.

Information for each reportable segment as of October 25,
    2009, October 26, 2008 and October 28, 2007 and for
    the years then ended, is as follows:

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

Applied leases some of its facilities and equipment under
    non-cancelable operating leases and has options to renew most
    leases, with rentals to be negotiated. Total rent expense was
    $64 million for fiscal 2009, $68 million for fiscal
    2008, and $62 million for fiscal 2007. Future minimum lease
    payments at October 25, 2009 totaled $143 million and
    were: $43 million for fiscal 2010; $29 million for
    fiscal 2011; $20 million for fiscal 2012; $11 million
    for fiscal 2013; $8 million for fiscal 2014; and
    $32 million collectively for all periods thereafter.

Discounted
    Letters of Credit

Applied discounts letters of credit through various financial
    institutions. Under these agreements, Applied discounted letters
    of credit in the amounts of $299 million for fiscal 2009,
    $167 million for fiscal 2008 and $431 million for
    fiscal 2007. Discounting fees were not material for all periods
    presented. In fiscal 2009 and 2008, Applied factored accounts
    receivable and discounted promissory notes totaling
    $43 million and $138 million, respectively.

Warranty

Applied products are generally sold with a

12-month

warranty period following installation. The provision for the
    estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is
    recognized. Parts and labor are covered under the terms of the
    warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based on
    historical experience by product, configuration and geographic
    region.

    to the current year’s net sales, and warranty consumption
    is associated with current and prior year’s net sales.

Guarantees

During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to certain
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 25, 2009, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee agreements was
    approximately $83 million. Applied has not recorded any
    liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements below
    that required to appropriately account for the underlying
    transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on
    historical experience and information currently available, that
    it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid
    under these guarantee arrangements.



APPLIED

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate
    subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft
    arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of
    credit. As of October 25, 2009, Applied Materials Inc. has
    provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately
    $179 million to cover these services.

Legal
    Matters

Jusung

Applied has been engaged in a number of lawsuits and patent and
    administrative proceedings in Taiwan and South Korea since 2003
    with Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. (Jusung Engineering)

and/or

Jusung Pacific Co., Ltd. (Jusung Pacific, referred to together
    with Jusung Engineering as Jusung) involving technology used in
    manufacturing LCDs. Applied believes that it has meritorious
    claims and defenses against Jusung that it intends to pursue
    vigorously.

In 2004, Applied filed a complaint for patent infringement
    against Jusung in the Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan seeking
    damages and a permanent injunction for infringement of a patent
    related to chemical vapor deposition (CVD) equipment, and
    this case remains pending. Jusung Pacific unsuccessfully sought
    invalidation of Applied’s CVD patent in the Taiwanese
    Intellectual Property Office (TIPO). Jusung Pacific’s
    initial appeal of the TIPO’s decision was denied, and it
    has filed a further appeal to the Taipei High Supreme
    Administrative Court. In 2006, Applied filed an action in the
    TIPO challenging the validity of a patent owned by Jusung
    Engineering related to severability of the transfer chamber on a
    CVD tool. Jusung Engineering filed a lawsuit against Applied and
    AKT America in Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan alleging
    infringement of the same patent. The TIPO granted Applied’s
    request for invalidation and revoked Jusung Engineering’s
    patent. In March 2009, the Hsinchu District Court dismissed
    Jusung Engineering’s lawsuit, and in April 2009, the
    Ministry of Economic Affairs overruled Jusung Engineering’s
    administrative appeal of the decision revoking its patent.
    Jusung has appealed both decisions. In 2006, Jusung Engineering
    filed a complaint of private prosecution in the Taipei District
    Court of Taiwan alleging that Applied’s outside counsel
    received from the Court and used a copy of an expert report that
    Jusung had filed in the ongoing patent infringement lawsuits
    that Jusung had intended to remain confidential. The complaint
    names as defendants Applied’s outside counsel in Taiwan, as
    well as Michael R. Splinter, Applied’s President and Chief
    Executive Officer, as the statutory representative of Applied.
    The Taipei District Court dismissed the private prosecution
    complaint, and the matter was transferred to the Taipei District
    Attorney’s Office. The Taipei District Attorney’s
    Office has issued three successive rulings not to prosecute,
    each of which Jusung Engineering has appealed to the Taiwan High
    Court District Attorney. In each instance, the Taiwan High Court
    District Attorney has returned the matter to the Taipei District
    Attorney’s Office for further consideration, where it
    remains pending.

In 2007, Jusung Engineering filed a complaint against AKT
    America in Seoul Central District Court in Seoul, Korea,
    alleging infringement of a Jusung patent involving the
    showerhead assembly of plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition
    (PECVD) equipment. After the Korean Intellectual Property Office
    (KIPO) ruled that Jusung’s patent was invalid, the District
    Court dismissed Jusung Engineering’s infringement action,
    which Jusung Engineering appealed. In July 2009, the Korean
    Supreme Court dismissed Jusung’s appeal of the KIPO’s
    determination that the showerhead assembly patent is invalid,
    and Jusung’s related

confirmation-of-scope

action was also dismissed. On September 10, 2009, Jusung
    Engineering withdrew its appeal of the dismissal of its
    infringement action, and all proceedings regarding Jusung’s
    invalidated Korean showerhead assembly patent are now concluded.

Also in 2007, Applied filed a complaint against Jusung
    Engineering in the Seoul Central District Court for infringement
    of an Applied patent involving the housing for a substrate
    supporting pin used in PECVD equipment. After the KIPO ruled
    that Applied’s patent was invalid, the District Court
    dismissed Applied’s infringement action. Applied’s
    appeals of the dismissals of the infringement action, as well as
    a related confirmation of scope case, were dismissed. On
    September 10, 2009, the Korean Supreme Court affirmed the
    KIPO’s determination that the pin patent was invalid, and
    all proceedings regarding Applied’s invalidated Korean
    substrate supporting pin patent are now concluded.



APPLIED

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

From time to time, Applied receives notification from third
    parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking
    indemnification, litigation support, payment of money or other
    actions by Applied in connection with claims made against them.
    In addition, from time to time, Applied receives notification
    from third parties claiming that Applied may be or is infringing
    their intellectual property or other rights. Applied also is
    subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, both
    asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of
    business.

Although the outcome of the above-described matters or these
    claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
    Applied does not believe that any of these proceedings or other
    claims will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated
    financial condition or results of operations.

Note 14

Business
    Combinations

On January 31, 2008, Applied acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of Baccini, a privately-held company based in
    Italy, for a purchase price of $215 million in cash, net of
    cash and marketable securities acquired. The acquired business
    is a leading supplier of automated metallization and test
    systems for manufacturing c-Si photovoltaic cells. In connection
    with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $158 million and intangible assets of $130 million. Of
    the $130 million of acquired intangible assets,
    $61 million was assigned to acquired backlog (to be
    amortized over 2 years), $34 million was assigned to
    customer relationships (to be amortized over 9 years),
    $27 million was assigned to purchased technology (to be
    amortized over 7 years), $6 million was assigned to
    covenants not to compete (to be amortized over 2 years),
    and $3 million was assigned to trademarks and tradenames
    (to be amortized over 7 years). The allocation of the
    purchase price was based on estimates of the fair value of the
    assets acquired and is subject to adjustment upon finalization
    of the purchase price allocation. The acquired business is
    reported under the Energy and Environmental Solutions segment.

On November 9, 2007, Applied purchased from Edwards Vacuum,
    Inc. certain assets of its Kachina semiconductor equipment parts
    cleaning and refurbishment business for $19 million. The
    acquisition expanded Applied’s existing Chamber Performance
    Services network of facilities that provide customers worldwide
    with technology and support for maintaining their chamber
    components. In connection with this acquisition, Applied
    recorded goodwill of $13 million and an intangible asset of
    $3 million (customer relationships, to be amortized over
    13 years). The acquired business is reported under the
    Applied Global Services segment.

On August 23, 2007, Applied acquired all of the outstanding
    shares of Switzerland-based HCT for $463 million in cash,
    net of cash acquired. The acquired business is a leading
    supplier of precision wafering systems used principally in
    manufacturing c-Si substrates for the solar industry. In
    connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $354 million and other intangible assets of
    $180 million. Of the $180 million of acquired
    intangible assets, $59 million was assigned to purchased
    technology (to be amortized over 11 years),
    $59 million was assigned to customer relationships (to be
    amortized over 7 years), $47 million was assigned to
    acquired backlog (to be amortized over 1 year),
    $8 million was assigned to trademarks and tradenames (to be
    amortized over 13 years), and $7 million was assigned
    to covenants not to compete (to be amortized over 3 years).
    The acquired business is reported under the Energy and
    Environmental Solutions segment.

On March 30, 2007, Applied purchased Brooks Software, a
    division of Brooks Automation, Inc., for $137 million in
    cash. The acquired business is a leading provider of factory
    management and control software to the semiconductor and flat
    panel display industries. The products complement Applied’s
    existing software applications and enable Applied to offer
    customers a comprehensive computer integrated manufacturing
    (CIM) solution for optimizing fab operations. Applied
    recorded an in-process research and development (IPR&D)
    expense of $5 million, reported as research, development
    and engineering expense, goodwill of $77 million, and other
    intangible assets of $47 million. Of the $47 million
    of acquired intangible assets, $21 million was assigned to
    purchased technology (to be amortized over 4 to 11 years),
    $21 million was assigned to maintenance contracts (to be
    amortized over 7 years), $2 million was assigned to
    acquired backlog (to be amortized over 1 year),
    $2 million was assigned to trademarks and tradenames (to be
    amortized over 7 years), and $1 million was assigned
    to customer

    STATEMENTS — (Continued)

relationships (to be amortized over 4 years). The acquired
    business is reported under the Applied Global Services segment.

The acquired IPR&D expense was determined by identifying
    research projects for which technological feasibility had not
    been established and no alternative future use existed. The
    value of the projects identified as in-process was determined by
    estimating the future cash flows from the projects once
    commercially feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to
    their present value at a rate commensurate with the level of
    risk and maturity of the projects, and then applying a
    percentage of completion to the calculated value.

For all of the purchase business combinations discussed above,
    the results of operations prior to the acquisition dates were
    not material in relation to those of Applied for any of the
    periods presented herein. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    reviewed periodically for impairment and purchased technology is
    amortized over its useful life of 1 to 15 years.

Note 15

Subsequent
    Events Through December 11, 2009

On November 11, 2009, Applied announced that it will
    implement a restructuring program beginning in the first quarter
    of fiscal 2010. As part of this program, Applied plans to reduce
    its global workforce as of October 25, 2009 by
    approximately 1,300 to 1,500 positions, or 10 to
    12 percent, over a period of 18 months, consistent
    with local legal requirements and in consultation with employee
    works councils and other employee representatives, as
    applicable. The Company anticipates the pre-tax cost of the plan
    to be between $100 million and $125 million.

On November 16, 2009, Applied entered into an agreement to
    acquire all of the outstanding shares of Semitool, Inc.
    (Semitool), a public company based in the state of Montana, for
    $11 per share in an all-cash tender offer (the Offer). Semitool
    is a leading supplier of electrochemical plating and wafer
    surface preparation equipment used by semiconductor packaging
    and manufacturing companies globally. Under the terms of the
    agreement approved by the Boards of Directors of both companies,
    Applied will pay an aggregate purchase price of approximately
    $364 million based on the fully-diluted capitalization of
    Semitool upon closing the acquisition (the Merger). The
    acquisition will be conducted through a tender offer for all of
    the outstanding shares of Semitool and is conditioned on the
    occurrence or absence of certain events, including the tender of
    at least 66.67% of Semitool’s outstanding stock on a
    fully-diluted basis, as well as regulatory approvals and other
    customary closing conditions.

Subsequent to announcement of the Offer, three purported class
    action lawsuits were filed in state court in the County of
    Flathead, State of Montana, against Semitool, Semitool’s
    directors, Applied and Applied’s acquisition subsidiary.
    The actions seek certification of a class of all holders of
    Semitool common stock (except the defendants and their
    affiliates). The complaints allege, among other things, that
    Semitool’s directors breached their fiduciary duties by
    failing to maximize shareholder value, securing benefits for
    certain defendants at the expense or to the detriment of
    Semitool’s public shareholders, discouraging

and/or

inhibiting alternative offers, and failing to disclose material
    nonpublic information, and that Applied aided and abetted such
    alleged breaches. The actions seek injunctive relief enjoining
    the defendants from consummating the Offer and the Merger,
    damages, and attorneys’ fees. Applied believes the claims
    alleged against it are without merit and intends to defend
    against them vigorously.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    October 25, 2009 and October 26, 2008, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
    and comprehensive income (loss), and cash flows for each of the
    years in the three-year period ended October 25, 2009. In
    connection with our audits of the consolidated financial
    statements, we also have audited the financial statement
    schedule II. These consolidated financial statements and
    financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the
    Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an
    opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    October 25, 2009 and October 26, 2008, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended October 25, 2009, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 11 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    uncertainty in income taxes at the beginning of fiscal year 2008.

As discussed in Note 10 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for
    defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans at the
    beginning of fiscal year 2009.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
    Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control
    over financial reporting as of October 25, 2009, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report
    dated December 11, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.
