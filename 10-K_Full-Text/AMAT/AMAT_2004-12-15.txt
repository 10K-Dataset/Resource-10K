PART I

Item 1:

Business

Organized in 1967, Applied, a Delaware
corporation, develops, manufactures, markets and services
integrated circuit fabrication equipment for the worldwide
semiconductor industry. Customers for these products include
semiconductor wafer manufacturers and semiconductor integrated
circuit (or chip) manufacturers, who either use the
semiconductors they manufacture in their own products or sell
them to other companies for use in advanced electronic
components.

Most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and
include a variety of circuit components, such as transistors and
other devices, that are connected by multiple layers of wiring
(interconnects). As the density of the circuit components
increases to enable greater computing power in the same or
smaller area, the complexity of building the chip also
increases, necessitating the formation of smaller structures and
more intricate wiring schemes. To build a chip, the transistors,
capacitors and other circuit components are first created on the
surface of the wafer by performing a series of processes to
deposit and remove selected film layers. Similar processes are
then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer.
A typical, simplified process sequence for building the wiring
portion of chips involves initially depositing a dielectric film
layer onto the base layer of circuit components using a chemical
vapor deposition (CVD) system. An etch system is then used
to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer. To form
the metal wiring, these openings and patterns are subsequently
filled with conducting material using physical vapor deposition
(PVD) and/or electrochemical plating
(ECP) technologies. A chemical mechanical polishing
(CMP) step then polishes the wafer to achieve a flat
surface. Additional deposition, etch and CMP steps are then
performed to build up the layers of wiring needed to complete
the interconnection of the circuit elements to form the chip.
Advanced chip designs require about 500 steps involving these
and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle.

Applied operates in a single industry segment and
currently manufactures systems that perform most of the primary
steps in the chip fabrication process, including: atomic layer
deposition (ALD), CVD, PVD, ECP, etch, ion implantation, rapid
thermal processing (RTP), CMP, wafer metrology and inspection,
and systems that generate, etch, measure and inspect circuit
patterns on masks used in the photolithography process.
Applied’s subsidiary AKT, Inc. (AKT) manufactures CVD
systems and array testers for making flat panel displays (FPDs)
used in notebook computers, desktop monitors, televisions and
other applications. Applied also provides products and services
to enhance manufacturing yields.



Most of Applied’s products are single-wafer
systems with multiple process chambers attached to a base
platform. Each wafer is processed separately in its own
environment, allowing precise control of the process, while the
system’s multiple chambers enable simultaneous, high
productivity manufacturing. Applied sells most of its
single-wafer, multi-chamber systems on four basic platforms: the
Centura®, the Endura®, the Producer® and the
Vantage®. These platforms currently support ALD, CVD, PVD,
etch and RTP technologies.

In fiscal 2004, Applied broadened its line of
platforms to include Parallel Wafer Processing

TM

systems through its acquisition of Torrex Equipment Corporation
(Torrex). The FlexStar

TM

system, used for CVD
applications, is capable of processing up to 25 wafers at a time
in a furnace environment.

Throughout its history, the semiconductor
industry has migrated to increasingly larger wafers to build
chips. The predominant wafer size used for volume production
today is 200mm, or eight-inch, wafers, but a substantial number
of new fabs that are being built use 300mm, or 12-inch, wafers
to gain the economic advantages of a larger surface area.
Applied offers a comprehensive line of systems to support 200mm
and 300mm wafer processing.

A majority of process steps used in chipmaking
are performed to build the interconnect, a complex matrix of
microscopic wires that carry electrical signals to connect the
transistor and capacitor components of a chip. Customers are
transitioning from using aluminum as the main conducting
material for the interconnect to copper, which has lower
resistance than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller
area. Applied is a leading supplier of systems for manufacturing
copper-based chips, ranging from the systems to deposit
dielectric, tantalum nitride barrier and copper materials to CMP
systems to smooth these layers for optimized planarity.

Complementing the transition to copper to improve
chip speed is the use of highly efficient low dielectric
constant (low k) films to replace silicon dioxide as the
insulator between the copper wiring structures. Applied leads
the industry in providing low k dielectric systems that are used
in volume production by a number of semiconductor manufacturers.

The transistor portion of the chip is another
area in which semiconductor manufacturers are advancing their
device designs to improve speed. Applied introduced several new
products during fiscal 2004 for building smaller and faster
transistors by expanding its offerings in ion implantation,
epitaxial deposition and silicon nitride systems.

Products

The following summarizes Applied’s portfolio
of products and their associated process technology areas.

Deposition

Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a
semiconductor. During deposition, a layer of either dielectric
(material used as insulation between conductors) or electrically
conductive (typically metal materials used to carry current)
film is deposited or grown on a wafer. Applied currently
provides equipment to perform the four main types of deposition:
ALD, CVD, PVD and ECP. In addition, Applied’s rapid thermal
processing systems can be used to perform certain types of
dielectric deposition.

Atomic Layer Deposition

ALD is an emerging technology in which single
layers of atoms are used to build chip structures. This
technology enables customers to deposit thin layers of either
conducting or insulating material with uniform coverage in very
small areas. Applied offers ALD chambers for depositing tungsten
and tantalum nitride films. The Applied Endura
iCuBS

TM

product is the industry’s first system
to integrate ALD and PVD chambers on a single platform for
depositing critical barrier and seed layers in copper
interconnects. The Applied Centura iSprint

TM

Tungsten
system (iSprint) combines an ALD chamber, which deposits a
tungsten nucleation film, with a CVD tungsten bulk fill process
in one system. The iSprint is used to form contact structures
that connect the transistors to the wiring areas of the chip.



Chemical Vapor Deposition

CVD is used by customers to deposit dielectric
and metal films on a wafer. During the CVD process, gases that
contain atoms of the material to be deposited react on the wafer
surface, forming a thin film of solid material. Films deposited
by CVD may be silicon oxide, single-crystal epitaxial silicon,
amorphous silicon, silicon nitride, dielectric anti-reflective
coatings, low k dielectric (highly efficient insulating
materials), high k dielectric (electrical charge-storing
materials), aluminum, titanium, titanium nitride, polysilicon,
tungsten, refractory metals or silicides. Applied offers the
following CVD products and technologies:

The Applied Producer CVD
system

— This
high-throughput platform features Twin-Chamber® modules
that have two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up to
three Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer
platform, giving it a maximum simultaneous processing capacity
of six wafers. Many dielectric CVD processes can be performed on
this platform. The Applied Producer Advanced Patterning
Film

TM

process is an innovative CVD hardmask film
that enables customers to fabricate sub-50 nanometer (nm)
transistor gates and contact structures using standard
lithography. The Applied Producer DARC® 193 deposits a
dielectric anti-reflective coating that provides the precise
dimensional control and compatibility needed for fabricating
interconnects and transistors using advanced lithography methods.

The Applied Centura Ultima HDP-CVD®
system

— High-density plasma
CVD (HDP-CVD) is used to fill very small, deep spaces with
dielectric film. One of the processes that can be performed on
the system is fluorinated silicate glass (FSG), a film with
higher insulating value than traditionally-used silicon dioxide
material, that enables faster chip performance. The Applied
Centura Ultima HDP-CVD product is used by a number of major
semiconductor manufacturers for gap-fill applications, including
the deposition of FSG in their advanced interconnect structures
and deposition of silicon oxides in substrate isolation
structures.

Low k Dielectric
Films

— Many semiconductor
manufacturers are now incorporating new low k dielectric
materials in their copper-based chip designs to improve
interconnect speed. The Applied Producer Black Diamond® CVD
low k system is being used by several customers in volume
production to produce some of the industry’s most advanced
devices. Using conventional CVD equipment, the Black Diamond
product provides customers with a cost-effective way to
transition to this new material. A complementary low k
dielectric film, called the Applied Producer BLOk

TM

(Barrier low k), enables the complete, multi-layer
dielectric structure to benefit from low k technology.

Epitaxial
Deposition

— Epitaxial
silicon (epitaxy or epi) is a layer of pure silicon grown in a
uniform crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high
quality base for the device circuitry. Epi technology is used in
an increasing number of semiconductor devices in both the wafer
substrate and transistor areas of a chip to enhance speed. The
Applied Centura Epi system integrates pre- and post-epi
processes on the same system to improve film quality and reduce
production costs. This system is also being used for
silicon-germanium epi technology, which can reduce power usage
and increase speed in certain types of advanced chips. For
emerging transistor designs, the Company’s Applied Centura
RP Epi system offers selective epi processes to enable faster
transistor switching without the need to shrink the scale of the
device.

Polysilicon
Deposition

— Polysilicon is
a type of silicon used to form portions of the transistor
structure within the semiconductor device. The Applied Centura
Polygen

TM

LPCVD (low pressure chemical vapor
deposition) system is a single-wafer, multi-chamber product that
deposits thin, polysilicon films at high temperatures with high
productivity and process control. A variant of the system, the
Applied Centura Polycide LPCVD product, combines chambers for
polysilicon and tungsten silicide deposition on the Centura
platform in an integrated process to create transistor gate
structures in memory chips. To address the challenging
requirements of 130nm and below devices, the Applied Centura
Gate Stack system integrates chambers for decoupled plasma
nitridation (DPN) and RTP anneal on one platform to enable
superior film quality and material properties.

In fiscal 2004, Applied added the
FlexStar

TM

LPCVD system to its product portfolio
through its acquisition of Torrex. The FlexStar system uses
Parallel Wafer Processing technology to deliver high quality
silicon films with high productivity. Combining short cycle
times, single-wafer process flexibility and lower cost of
ownership, this system provides customers with highly
cost-sensitive thermal applications for transistor production.



Silicon Nitride
Deposition

— The Applied
Centura SiNgen®

Plus

LPCVD system is a single-wafer,
high-temperature system that deposits silicon nitride films in
transistor-area applications. This system minimizes the amount
of time the wafer is exposed to high temperatures and reduces
particles while improving operating cost and productivity in
critical transistor nitride layers for 130nm and below devices.
The system also features the DPN chamber which uses a plasma
process to incorporate a high concentration of nitrogen into the
gate oxide to prevent leakage in devices with 90nm and below
designs.

Tungsten
Deposition

— Tungsten is
used in the contact area of a chip that connects the transistors
to the wiring circuitry. In aluminum-based devices, tungsten is
also used in the structures that connect the multiple layers of
aluminum wiring. The Company has two products for depositing
tungsten: the Applied Centura Sprint

TM

Tungsten CVD
system for 130nm and 90nm devices and the advanced Applied
Centura iSprint ALD/ CVD system. The latter product combines ALD
technology and CVD chambers on the same platform for 65nm and
below applications.

Physical Vapor Deposition

PVD, also called sputtering, is a physical
process in which atoms of a gas, such as argon, are accelerated
toward a metal target. The metal atoms chip off, or sputter
away, and are then deposited on the wafer. The Applied Endura
PVD system offers a broad range of advanced deposition
processes, including aluminum, aluminum alloys, cobalt,
titanium/titanium nitride, tantalum/tantalum nitride,
tungsten/tungsten nitride, nickel vanadium and copper (Cu). The
Applied Endura CuBS (copper barrier/seed) PVD system, launched
in fiscal 1998, is widely used by customers for fabricating
copper-based chips. Using PVD technology, the system deposits
critical layers that prevent copper material from entering other
areas of the device and primes the structure for the subsequent
deposition of bulk copper by electrochemical plating.

The Applied Endura system’s highly flexible,
multi-chamber architecture allows the integration of multiple
PVD processes or combinations of metal CVD and PVD technologies
on the same system. In addition to the integrated Applied Endura
iCuBS ALD/ PVD system (discussed in the Atomic Layer Deposition
section), the Applied Endura iLB

TM

(integrated liner
barrier) system combines a PVD chamber for depositing titanium
with a CVD chamber for titanium nitride deposition to form
critical lining layers of interconnect structures. These
structures are subsequently filled with tungsten, aluminum or
other materials. In fiscal 2004, Applied introduced the Applied
Endura2 platform, a new generation of its Endura platform,
designed to extend the Endura into future chip generations. The
Endura2 platform has 20 percent fewer parts and sets a new
standard for design that emphasizes reliability, serviceability
and overall equipment efficiency for 300mm high-volume
manufacturing.

Electrochemical Plating

Electrochemical plating is a process by which
metal atoms from a chemical fluid (an electrolyte) are deposited
on the surface of an immersed object. Its main application in
the semiconductor industry is to deposit copper in interconnect
wiring structures. This process step follows the deposition of
barrier and seed layers which prevent the copper from
contaminating other areas of the device and improve the adhesion
of the copper film.

The Applied SlimCell

TM

ECP
(electrochemical plating) system offers a small-volume cell
design that allows independent bath chemistry for multi-step
processing. The system enables a reduction in defect levels
compared to conventional large bath systems while reducing
chemical consumption.

Etch

Etching is used many times throughout the
semiconductor manufacturing process to selectively remove
material from the surface of a wafer. Before etching begins, the
wafer is coated with a light-sensitive film, called photoresist.
A photolithography process then projects the circuit pattern
onto the wafer. Etching removes material only from areas
dictated by the photoresist pattern. Applied offers a full range
of systems for etching dielectric, metal and silicon films to
meet the requirements of sub-100nm processing.

For dielectric applications, the Applied Centura
eMax® system etches a broad range of films in the contact
and interconnect regions of the chip. In fiscal 2003, Applied
introduced a high-throughput Applied



Producer Etch system that utilizes the
Twin-Chamber Producer platform concept to target cost-sensitive
dielectric etch applications in 90nm and below design
geometries. To address advanced low k etch applications, the
Applied Centura Enabler® Etch system performs etch, strip
and clean steps in a single chamber. The Enabler’s
all-in-one capability streamlines the process flow for 65nm and
below chip designs and significantly reduces operating costs.

The Applied Centura DPS Etch systems are used to
etch conducting films, such as metal and silicon materials, and
offer customers the technology, productivity and reliability
required for 100nm and below processing. The Applied Centura
Transforma

TM

Etch patterning system combines silicon
etch technology with integrated metrology capability to enable
customers to improve process control, device yield and overall
fab cycle time for building advanced transistor gate structures.

Ion Implantation

During ion implantation, silicon wafers are
bombarded by a beam of ions, called dopants, that penetrate (or
implant) the film surface to a desired depth. The implantation
step is used during transistor fabrication to change electrical
properties of a material and achieve a particular electrical
performance.

Low-energy, high current implant technology is
important to enabling the fabrication of smaller structures,
which contributes to faster transistor performance. The Applied
Quantum® X Implanter, introduced in 2004, provides
chipmakers with a production-worthy, single-wafer, high-current
implanter that enables transistor scaling to the 65nm node and
below. The Quantum X system’s high tilt capability,
together with its precise energy control and low defect levels,
deliver the process technology needed to achieve the most
difficult and critical implants required for 65nm and 45nm logic
and advanced DRAM manufacturing.

Rapid Thermal Processing

RTP subjects a wafer to rapid bursts of intense
heat that can take the wafer from room temperature to more than
1,000 degrees Celsius in less than 10 seconds. RTP is used
mainly for modifying the properties of deposited films. The
Applied Centura Radiance®

Plus

and Applied Vantage
Radiance

Plus

RTP systems feature the same advanced RTP
technology with differing platform designs. While the
multi-chamber Centura platform offers exceptional process
flexibility, the streamlined 2-chamber Vantage platform is
designed for dedicated high-volume manufacturing. These
single-wafer RTP systems are also used for growing high quality
oxide and oxynitride films, deposition steps that traditional
large batch furnaces can no longer achieve with the necessary
precision and control.

Chemical Mechanical Polishing

CMP removes material from a wafer to create a
flat (planarized) surface. This process allows subsequent
photolithography patterning steps to occur with greater accuracy
and enables film layers to build with minimal height variations.
The Company’s 200mm Applied Mirra® and Mirra
Mesa® systems and 300mm Applied Reflexion® system have
led the industry in CMP technology with important features such
as integrated cleaning, film measurement and process control
capabilities. In fiscal 2004, Applied launched a major
breakthrough with its 300mm Applied Reflexion LK
Ecmp

TM

system. Introducing innovative,
electro-chemical mechanical planarization (Ecmp) capability on
Applied’s proven Reflexion LK platform, this new system
provides a uniquely high-performance, cost-effective and
extendible solution for copper/low k manufacturing at the 65nm
node and below. The Ecmp system removes bulk copper at a high
rate by electric charge, independent of downforce, making it
ideal for fragile ultra-low k films.

Metrology and Wafer
    Inspection

Applied offers several types of products that are
used to inspect the wafer during various stages of the
fabrication process:

Critical Dimension and Defect Review Scanning
    Electron Microscopes (CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)

Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an
electron beam to form images of microscopic features, or
critical dimensions (CDs), of a semiconductor wafer at extremely
high magnification. Applied’s SEMs



provide customers with full automation, along
with the high accuracy and sensitivity needed for measuring very
small CDs. In 2004, the Company introduced its Applied
VeritySEM

TM

Metrology system, which uses proprietary
new SEM imaging technology to enable precise control of the
lithography and etching processes. The VeritySEM measures
transistor CDs with less than 5 angstrom precision — a
requirement for 45nm device production — and
incorporates automation and software advancements for
significantly higher throughput in production.

DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (such as,
particles, scratches or residues) that are first located by a
defect detection system and then classify the defects to
identify their source. The high-throughput, fully automatic
Applied SEMVision

TM

G2 Defect Analysis system enables
customers to use this technology as an integral part of their
production lines to analyze defects as small as 50nm with high
productivity. The Applied SEMVision G2 FIB, introduced in 2004,
integrates advanced defect review SEM capability with automated
focused ion beam (FIB) technology in one system. The FIB
provides a cross-sectional view of the defects reviewed by the
SEM, enabling chipmakers to analyze the defects in minutes as
part of their in-line review process.

The Applied BX-10 Implant/ Anneal Metrology
system measures critical process parameters that directly affect
transistor performance and provides users with monitoring
capability for multiple device generations.

Wafer Inspection

Using laser-based technology, defects can be
detected on patterned wafers (wafers with circuit images printed
on them) as they move between processing steps. Defects may
include particles, open circuit lines, shorts between lines or
other problems. The Applied ComPlus-EV

TM

Inspection
system detects defects in devices with design rules of 90nm and
below. Incorporating key advances in imaging technology, the
system captures up to 50 percent more defects than the
previous system with the high speed required for customers’
volume production lines.

Flat Panel Displays

The most advanced flat panel displays (FPDs) are
manufactured using technologies similar to those for making
semiconductors. One significant difference is the vastly larger
area of the substrate (panel). The panels can be up to 60 times
larger in area than today’s largest wafers (300mm
diameter). New generation FPD fabs are being built primarily for
manufacturing large-area flat panel liquid crystal display
(LCD) television screens.

Applied’s wholly-owned subsidiary AKT
supplies plasma-enhanced CVD (PECVD) systems and electron
beam array testers to FPD manufacturers. Applied offers a range
of systems that can process different substrate sizes to meet
the industry’s requirements for ever larger substrates. In
response to the growing demand for LCD televisions, Applied
introduced its latest PECVD system in fiscal 2004, the
seventh-generation (Gen 7) AKT-40K PECVD, which addresses
FPD fab requirements for substrates measuring 1.8 meters by
2.2 meters. Complementing the PECVD system, AKT also
introduced a Gen 7 electron beam test system, the AKT-40K
EBT, which tests the substrates during production for defective
pixels and other imperfections.

Mask Making

Masks are used by photolithography systems to
transfer microscopic circuit designs onto wafers. Since an
imperfection in a mask may be replicated on the wafer, the mask
must be virtually defect-free. Applied provides systems for the
writing, etching, measurement and inspection of masks.

Customer Service and Support

Applied Global Services plays a critical role in
the Company’s ability to continuously satisfy its
customers’ production requirements. Approximately 2,700
trained customer engineers and process support engineers are
deployed in more than a dozen countries. These engineers are
usually located at or near customers’ fab sites and service
over 17,000 installed Applied systems.



Applied offers a broad range of service products
to maintain and service equipment in customers’ fabs. For
example, with the Applied Total Parts Management®
(TPM) program, the Company provides an inventory management
service for spare parts used in Applied systems at a
customer’s fab. A second product, the Applied Total Support
Package® (TSP), is a comprehensive equipment service
solution that includes parts management along with system cost
and performance improvement targets for Applied equipment at the
customer’s location. The Applied
SparesSolutions

TM

program is an on-line, customer
support service that streamlines the procurement of spare parts.
The Applied Total Kit Management

TM

program provides
customers with a convenient, cost-effective way to manage their
systems’ process kit service requirements. Applied also
refurbishes and sells used Applied equipment.

Applied entered into several new agreements in
2004 as part of its strategic initiative to expand its fab
service capabilities for customers. Applied and Brooks
Automation, Inc., signed an agreement to provide on-site support
and spare parts management for certain of Brooks’ factory
automation hardware products. During 2004, Applied entered into
other agreements with multiple companies to provide additional
services and products, including fab-wide commodity consumables
services and wafer reclaim services. On August  16,
2004, Applied announced that it had entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire substantially all of the operating
subsidiaries and businesses of Metron Technology N.V., which
provides a wide range of outsource solutions to the
semiconductor industry.

Backlog

Applied’s backlog increased from
$2.5 billion at October 26, 2003 to $3.4 billion
at October 31, 2004. Applied manufactures its systems based
on order backlog and customer commitments. Backlog includes only
orders for which written authorizations have been accepted and
shipment dates within 12 months have been assigned or where
shipment has occurred but revenue has not been recognized. In
addition, backlog includes contractual service revenue and
maintenance fees to be earned within the next 12 months.
Backlog adjustments for fiscal 2004 totaled $114 million,
which consisted of cancellations, currency and other
adjustments. Customers may delay delivery of products or cancel
orders prior to shipment, subject to possible cancellation
penalties. Due to possible changes in delivery schedules and
cancellations of orders, Applied’s backlog at any
particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales
for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery schedules and/or a
reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a
material adverse effect on Applied’s business and results
of operations.

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and
Supplies

Applied’s manufacturing activities consist
primarily of assembling various commercial and proprietary
components into finished systems in Austin, Texas. Applied also
has manufacturing operations in Santa Clara, California;
Hillsboro, Oregon; Horsham, England; and Rehovot, Israel.
Manufacturing requires some raw materials, including a wide
variety of mechanical and electrical components, to be
manufactured to Applied’s specifications. Applied uses
numerous companies to supply parts, components and subassemblies
(parts) for the manufacture and support of its products.
Although Applied makes reasonable efforts to assure that parts
are available from multiple qualified suppliers, this is not
always possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be obtained
only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers.
Applied has sought, and will continue to seek, to minimize the
risk of production and service interruptions and/or shortages of
key parts by: (1) qualifying and selecting alternate
suppliers for key parts; (2) monitoring the financial
condition of key suppliers; (3) maintaining appropriate
inventories of key parts; and (4) qualifying new parts on a
timely basis.

Research, Development and
Engineering

Applied’s long-term growth strategy requires
continued development of new manufacturing products for
integrated circuit fabrication. Applied’s significant
investment in research, development and engineering (RD&E)
has generally enabled it to deliver new products and
technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus
allowing customers to incorporate these products into their
manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology
selection cycle. Applied works closely with its global customers
to design systems and processes that meet their planned
technical and production requirements. Product development and
engineering organizations are located primarily in the United
States, as well as in the United Kingdom and Israel, with
process support and customer demonstration laboratories in the
United States, the United Kingdom and



Israel. In addition, Applied outsources certain
RD&E activities, some of which are performed in other
countries.

Applied invested $1.1 billion
(21 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2002,
$921 million (21 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2003
and $992 million (12 percent of net sales) for fiscal
2004, in RD&E for product development and engineering
programs to create new product lines and improve existing
technologies and products. Applied has spent an average of
15 percent of net sales on RD&E over the last five
years. In addition to RD&E for specific product
technologies, Applied maintains ongoing programs for automation
control systems, materials research and environmental control
that have applications to its products. In fiscal 2004, Applied
focused on developing systems for customers’ new chip
designs, including systems to enable faster and denser
transistor and interconnect structures with 65nm and below
linewidths.

Marketing and Sales

Because of the highly technical nature of its
products, Applied markets and sells its products worldwide
through a direct sales force. For fiscal 2004, net sales to
customers in each region as a percentage of Applied’s total
net sales were: Taiwan 25 percent, Asia-Pacific (including
China) 20 percent, Japan 17 percent, North America
(primarily the United States) 17 percent, Korea
11 percent and Europe 10 percent. Applied’s
business is usually not seasonal in nature, but it is cyclical,
based on the capital equipment investment patterns of major
semiconductor manufacturers. These expenditure patterns are
based on many factors, including anticipated market demand and
pricing for integrated circuits, the development of new
technologies, factory utilization and global and regional
economic conditions.

During fiscal 2004, more than 80 percent of
Applied’s net sales were to regions outside of the United
States. Managing Applied’s global operations presents
challenges and involves uncertainties that may affect
Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
operations. For further discussion, see “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations — Trends, Risks and
Uncertainties — Applied is exposed to the risks of
operating a global business.”

Information on net sales to unaffiliated
customers and long-lived assets attributable to Applied’s
geographic regions is included in Note 10 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. Net sales to Intel
Corporation represented 10 percent of Applied’s fiscal
2002 net sales. During fiscal 2003, two customers
individually accounted for greater than 10 percent of net
sales: net sales to Intel Corporation represented
13 percent of Applied’s net sales and net sales to
Samsung America, Inc. represented 12 percent of
Applied’s net sales. During fiscal 2004, no individual
customer accounted for more than 10 percent of
Applied’s net sales.

Competition

The global semiconductor equipment industry is
highly competitive and is characterized by rapid technological
advancements and demanding worldwide service requirements.
Applied’s ability to compete primarily depends on its
ability to commercialize its technology and continually improve
its products, processes and services, as well as its ability to
develop new products that meet constantly evolving customer
requirements. Significant competitive factors for succeeding in
the semiconductor manufacturing equipment market include the
product’s technical capability, productivity and
cost-effectiveness, and level of technical service and support.
The importance of each of these factors varies depending on the
specific customer’s needs, including considerations such as
the customer’s process application, product requirements,
timing of the purchase and particular circumstances of the
purchasing decision. The pace of technological change is rapid,
with customers continually moving to smaller critical dimensions
and larger wafer sizes and adopting new materials for
fabricating chips. Existing technology can sometimes be adapted
to the new requirements, but some of these new requirements may
create the need for an entirely different technical approach.
The rapid pace of technological change continually creates
opportunities for existing competitors and startups, and can
quickly diminish the value of existing technologies.

Substantial competition exists for each of
Applied’s products. Competitors range from small companies
that compete with a single product and/or in a single region to
global companies with multiple lines of semiconductor processing
products. Competitors in a given technology tend to have
different degrees of market presence in various regional
markets. Management believes that Applied is a strong competitor
and



that its competitive position is based on the
ability of its products and services to continue to address
customer requirements. Success for Applied will require a
continued high level of investment in RD&E and in marketing,
sales and customer support activities.

Patents and Licenses

Management believes that Applied’s
competitive position is significantly dependent upon skills in
research, development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing,
and not just on its patent position. However, protection of
Applied’s technological assets by obtaining and enforcing
patents is important. Therefore, Applied has a practice to file
patent applications in the U.S. and other countries for
inventions that Applied considers significant. Applied has a
number of patents in the U.S. and other countries, and
additional applications are pending for new developments.
Although Applied does not consider its business materially
dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Applied and the
products made and sold under its patents taken as a whole, are a
significant element of Applied’s business. In addition to
patents, Applied also possesses other intellectual property,
including trademarks, knowhow, trade secrets and copyrights.

Applied enters into patent and technology
licensing agreements with other companies when management
determines that it is in its best interest to do so. Applied
pays royalties under existing patent license agreements for the
use, in several of its products, of certain patented
technologies that are licensed to Applied for the life of the
patents. Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted
to third parties. Royalties received from and paid to third
parties have not been and are not expected to be material in
relation to the consolidated results of operations.

In the normal course of business, Applied
periodically receives and makes inquiries regarding possible
patent infringement. In dealing with such inquiries, it may
become necessary or useful for Applied to obtain or grant
licenses or other rights. However, there can be no assurance
that such licenses or rights will be available to Applied on
commercially reasonable terms. If Applied is not able to resolve
a claim, negotiate a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary
licenses on commercially reasonable terms and/or successfully
prosecute or defend its position, Applied’s business,
financial condition and results of operations could be
materially and adversely affected.

Environmental Matters

Two of Applied’s locations have been
designated as environmental cleanup sites. In 1987, the United
States Environmental Protection Agency designated one of the
locations, in Santa Clara, California, as a Superfund site
and named Applied as a “Responsible Party.” Cleanup
activities at this site began in 1984 and were substantially
completed in February 2002. The California Regional Water
Quality Control Board has designated Applied as a
“Discharger” with respect to another site in
Sunnyvale, California. Although Applied was named a Discharger
at the Sunnyvale site in 1997, as it currently owns the site in
question, prior owners and operators are responsible for
performing cleanup and monitoring activities. Applied maintains
a number of environmental, health and safety programs that are
primarily preventive in nature. Neither compliance with federal,
state and local provisions regulating discharge of materials
into the environment, nor remedial agreements or other actions
relating to the environment, has had, or is expected to have, a
material effect on Applied’s capital expenditures,
competitive position, financial condition or results of
operations. The most recent report on Applied’s
environmental, health and safety activities can be found on the
Company’s web site at

http://www.appliedmaterials.com/about/environment.html

information contained on Applied’s website is part of this
report or is incorporated by reference herein.

Employees

None of Applied’s employees is represented
by a trade union, and management considers its relations with
employees to be good. In the high-technology industry,
competition for highly-skilled employees is intense. Applied
believes that its future success is highly dependent upon its
continued ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified
employees. There can be no assurance that Applied will be able
to attract, hire, assimilate and retain a sufficient number of
qualified employees. At October 31, 2004, Applied employed
12,191 regular employees and 769 temporary employees.

Item 3:

Legal Proceedings

Novellus

On June 13, 1997, after Varian Associates,
Inc. (Varian) failed to respond to requests by Applied to
discuss certain patent issues, Applied filed a lawsuit against
Varian captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Varian Associates,
Inc. (case no. C-97-20523-RMW) in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California, alleging
infringement of several of Applied’s patents concerning PVD
technology. On July 7, 1997, Applied amended that action to
allege infringement of those same Applied PVD patents against
Novellus Systems, Inc. (Novellus) and to add Novellus as a
defendant, as a result of Novellus’ acquisition of
Varian’s thin film systems PVD business. On June 23,
1997, Novellus filed a separate lawsuit against Applied
captioned Novellus Systems, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc.
(case no. C-97-20551-EAI) in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California, alleging
infringement by Applied of several PVD technology patents that
were formerly owned by Varian. Novellus sought damages for past
infringement, a permanent injunction, treble damages for willful
infringement, pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees. In
September 2000, Applied and Varian settled their disputes and
Applied released all claims with respect to the PVD technology
system, as it was made and sold as of May 7, 1997. On
October 3, 2000, Applied’s claims against Varian and
Varian’s claims and counterclaims against Applied were
dismissed with prejudice.

On September 20, 2004, Applied and Novellus
entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which
effects a full settlement of the pending lawsuits. Both lawsuits
have been dismissed with prejudice. As part of the MOU, Applied
agreed to pay Novellus $8 million and to forgive an
additional $3.5 million that Applied contended was owed
under a previous license and settlement agreement (TEOS
Agreement) between the parties. Patent licenses previously
granted under the TEOS Agreement by each of Novellus and Applied
become fully paid, as well as revocable only in limited
circumstances. The MOU contains additional covenants and
restrictions which, in general, limit the ability of each party
(including subsidiaries and permitted successors and assigns) to
sue the other, the other’s customers and, with some
exceptions, the other’s suppliers and distributors, for
infringement of any of the parties’ respective patents
covering products in technology areas in which both parties were
engaged in business as of September 3, 2004 (the Effective
Date), as follows: (i) for a period of five years from the
Effective Date as to existing products, and (ii) for a
period of two years from the Effective Date, with the
possibility to extend for an additional year, as to new products
introduced after the Effective Date (Covenants Not to Sue).
Technology areas in which neither party or only one party
engaged in business as of the Effective Date are specifically
excluded from the Covenants Not to Sue (Excluded Product Areas).
The parties further agreed to notice and cure periods prior to
filing suit on products subject to a Covenant Not to Sue that
has expired. No damages for infringement will accrue during the
Covenant Not to Sue and cure periods. The MOU contains a general
release of all claims arising prior to the Effective Date that
either Applied or Novellus may have had against the other and
the other’s customers and, with some exceptions, the
other’s suppliers and distributors, relating to
infringement of the party’s patents by any of the other
party’s products, other than those in Excluded Product
Areas. There is no license of patents, technology or trade
secrets in the MOU.

Linear Technology

On March 2, 2001, Linear Technology Corp.
(LTC) filed a third party complaint against Applied in the
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas,
captioned Texas Instruments, Inc. v. Linear Technology Corp. v.
Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. 2-01-CV4 (DF)). The
complaint against Applied alleged that Applied is obligated to
indemnify LTC and defend LTC for certain claims in the
underlying patent infringement lawsuit brought by Texas
Instruments, Inc. (TI) against LTC. The complaint also
alleged claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, and
various unfair business practices. In the complaint, LTC alleged
that, before LTC purchased certain equipment from Applied,
Applied failed to disclose to LTC that TI previously had won a
jury verdict against Hyundai Electronics Industries Co., Ltd.
(Hyundai) for patent infringement based on Hyundai’s use of
certain semiconductor equipment including some Applied tools.



LTC’s Texas lawsuit against Applied sought
indemnification and damages from Applied and an order requiring
Applied to defend LTC in the underlying lawsuit with TI. On
January 15, 2002, the court granted TI’s motion to
sever Applied and the other third party defendants from the
action and dismissed LTC’s action against Applied and the
other third party defendants without prejudice. On
March 12, 2002, LTC filed a complaint against Applied in
the Superior Court for the County of Santa Clara, captioned
Linear Technology Corp. v. Applied Materials, Inc., Novellus
Systems, Inc. and Tokyo Electron Ltd., (case no. CV806004)
alleging claims for breach of contract, fraud and deceit,
negligent misrepresentation, suppression of fact, unfair
competition, breach of warranty, express contractual indemnity,
implied equitable indemnity and declaratory relief. On
November 12, 2002, LTC filed an amended complaint in the
Santa Clara action asserting essentially the same claims as in
the original complaint but adding an additional assertion that
LTC and TI have settled their litigation. Applied’s motion
to dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part. LTC filed
a Second Amended Complaint and Applied’s motion to dismiss
the Second Amended Complaint was granted. LTC filed a Third
Amended Complaint and Applied’s motion to dismiss the Third
Amended Complaint was granted. On February 13, 2004, LTC
filed a Fourth Amended Complaint. Applied moved to dismiss the
Fourth Amended Complaint. LTC subsequently filed a motion to
amend its Fourth Amended Complaint, which the Court granted. On
July 7, 2004, LTC filed a Fifth Amended Complaint which
Applied moved to dismiss. On October 5, 2004,
Applied’s motion to dismiss LTC’s Fifth Amended
Complaint was granted with prejudice. Applied believes it has
meritorious defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

David Scharf

On July 31, 2001, David Scharf, an
individual, filed a lawsuit against Applied in the United States
District Court for the Central District of California, captioned
David Scharf v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case no. 01-06580
AHM). The lawsuit alleges that Applied has infringed, has
induced others to infringe and has contributed to others’
infringement of a patent concerning color synthesizing scanning
electron microscope technology. Mr. Scharf seeks a
preliminary and permanent injunction, damages and costs. Applied
has answered the complaint and counterclaimed for declaratory
judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. On May 10,
2002, Mr. Scharf filed a request for re-examination of his
patent with the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). On
June 26, 2002, the case was removed from the Court’s
active docket after the parties stipulated to stay the case
pending the results of that re-examination. On July 11,
2002, Applied filed its own request for re-examination of
Mr. Scharf’s patent with the PTO. Applied’s
request for re-examination was granted on September 19,
2002. On April 23, 2004, the PTO notified Applied that it
intended to issue a re-examination certificate. On June 14,
2004, Applied filed a second request for re-examination of
Mr. Scharf’s patent with the PTO. The second request
was denied on September 1, 2004. On October 1, 2004,
Applied filed a petition for reconsideration of that denial.
Applied believes it has meritorious defenses and counterclaims
and intends to pursue them vigorously.

ASMI

On August 27, 2002, ASM America, Inc. and
ASM International, N.V. (collectively ASMI) filed a lawsuit
against Applied in the United States District Court for the
District of Arizona, captioned ASM America, Inc. and ASM
International, N.V. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case
no. Civ’02 1660 PHX SMM). The lawsuit
sought a judicial declaration that ASMI does not infringe six
patents owned by Applied that relate to remote cleaning of CVD
chambers and to deposition of silicon nitride. The suit also
sought a judicial declaration that these patents were invalid.
Applied answered the complaint by denying the allegations and
counterclaiming for infringement of the six patents.

On October 3, 2003, ASMI filed a lawsuit
against Applied in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas, captioned ASM America, Inc. and ASM
International, N.V. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case
no. 2 03CV 348 TJW). The lawsuit alleged
infringement of six ASMI patents. Applied responded to the
complaint by denying the allegations and counterclaiming for a
declaratory judgment of invalidity, unenforceability and
non-infringement of the patents. Applied also asserted that ASMI
infringed seven Applied patents, including the six patents at
issue in the Arizona action plus an additional patent.

In August 2004, Applied and ASMI settled the
Arizona and the Texas lawsuits and stipulated to dismiss both
lawsuits without prejudice. The lawsuits were settled without
payment of any kind by any party and



without licensing any patents. The settlement has
not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse affect
on Applied’s business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates,
Inc.

On September 13, 2002, Varian Semiconductor
Equipment Associates, Inc. (VSEA) filed a demand for
arbitration with the American Arbitration Association asserting
that Applied has breached a patent license agreement between
VSEA and Applied dated January 1, 1992. VSEA seeks to
recover royalties, interest and attorneys’ fees. The
arbitration hearing on whether the products are covered by the
patent license agreement has concluded. On May 2, 2003, the
arbitration panel issued an interim decision finding that some,
but not all, of the patent claims asserted by VSEA were invalid.
On September 1, 2004, the arbitration panel issued a
decision in the second phase of the arbitration finding that
Applied had not proven the invalidity of certain patent claims
asserted by VSEA. To date, no hearing has been set to determine
the amount owed by Applied to VSEA under the agreement pursuant
to the arbitration panel’s decisions. Based on
Applied’s current assessment of this matter, Applied
believes that the amount of back royalty payments owed in
connection with this action, including interest, will not exceed
$25 million, of which $23 million was paid through
October 31, 2004. In addition to back royalty payments,
Applied will be required to make unit-based royalty payments on
future sales of certain products found to be within the scope of
the agreement. Applied expects that these unit-based royalty
payments will not have a material adverse effect on
Applied’s business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Jusung

On December 24, 2003, Applied filed a
lawsuit against Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd., and Jusung Pacific
Co., Ltd., (collectively Jusung) in Tao-Yuan District Court in
Taiwan captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung Engineering
Co., Ltd. (case no. 92 Tsai-chuan Tzi No. 6388). The
lawsuit alleges that Jusung is infringing a patent related to
chemical vapor deposition owned by Applied. In the suit, Applied
seeks a provisional injunction prohibiting Jusung from
importing, using, manufacturing, servicing or selling in Taiwan
certain flat panel display manufacturing equipment. On
December 25, 2003, the Tao-Yuan District Court ruled in
favor of Applied’s request for a provisional injunction
and, on January 14, 2004, the Court issued a provisional
injunction order. Jusung Pacific has appealed those decisions.
On January 30, 2004, Jusung Pacific sought permission to
post a counterbond to have the injunction lifted. Jusung
Pacific’s application was granted and, on March 30,
2004, the provisional injunction order was lifted. Applied
appealed the counterbond decisions and, on May 31, 2004,
the appellate court ruled that the injunction should be
reinstated pending a final decision on Applied’s appeal of
the grant of the counterbond. On June 30, 2004, Applied
filed a complaint against Jusung in the Hsinchu District Court
in Taiwan captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung
Engineering Co., Ltd. (case no. 93 Zhong Zhi No. 3).
In the suit, Applied seeks damages and a permanent injunction
for infringement of the same patent. On August 5, 2004, the
intermediate appellate court ruled in the provisional injunction
lawsuit that the injunction against Jusung Pacific should be
dissolved. Applied appealed that decision, and in December 2004,
the Supreme Court reversed the appellate court’s decision.
The injunction against Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd remains in
effect. The decisions regarding the provisional injunction and
counterbond had no effect on the separate patent infringement
lawsuit filed by Applied against Jusung in the Hsinchu Court.
Applied believes it has meritorious claims and intends to pursue
them vigorously.

Taiwan Fair Trade Commission

On April 10, 2004, the Taiwan Fair Trade
Commission (TFTC) notified Applied’s subsidiary AKT,
Inc. (AKT) in Taiwan that, pursuant to a complaint filed by
Jusung, the TFTC had begun an investigation into whether AKT
violated the Taiwan Fair Trade Act. The investigation focuses on
whether AKT violated the Taiwan Guidelines for the Review of
Cases Involving Enterprises Issuing Warning Letters for
Infringement on Copyright, Trademark and Patent Rights by
allegedly notifying customers about AKT’s patent rights and
the infringement of those rights by Jusung. On June 15,
2004, the TFTC notified Applied that Applied also was the
subject of the investigation. Both Applied and AKT have
responded to the TFTC’s inquiries. Although Applied
believes there has been no violation, neither the extent nor the
outcome of the investigation can be



determined at this time. Applied believes that
the outcome will not have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.

Axcelis Technologies

On January 8, 2001, Axcelis Technologies,
Inc. (Axcelis), formerly a subsidiary of Eaton Corporation,
filed a lawsuit against Applied in the United States District
Court for the District of Massachusetts, captioned Axcelis
Technologies, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case
no. 01-10029 DPW). The lawsuit alleged that Applied
infringed a patent concerning ion implantation owned by Axcelis.
The complaint also alleged various Massachusetts state and
common law tortious interference and unfair competition claims.
Axcelis sought a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages,
costs and attorneys’ fees. On April 12, 2001, Applied
answered the complaint by denying all allegations and
counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of invalidity and
non-infringement, and violations of various unfair and deceptive
trade practices laws. Applied sought damages, a permanent
injunction, costs and attorneys’ fees. On July 2,
2003, after a trial on the merits, a jury ruled in favor of
Applied, returning a verdict that Applied’s
Swift

TM

ion implantation system does not infringe
Axcelis’ patent. The court then entered judgment in favor
of Applied on Axcelis’ infringement claim. Axcelis appealed
the judgment. On March 5, 2004, Applied and Axcelis settled
the lawsuit and the parties have dismissed all claims and
counterclaims, including the appeal, with prejudice. The
settlement has not had a material effect on Applied’s
business, financial condition or results of operations.

Semitool

On June 11, 2001, Semitool, Inc. (Semitool)
filed a lawsuit against Applied in the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California, captioned
Semitool, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case
no. CV-01-2277 CRB). The lawsuit alleged that Applied
infringed a patent concerning seed repair and electroplating
owned by Semitool. Semitool sought a preliminary and permanent
injunction, damages, costs and attorneys’ fees. On
July 12, 2001, before Applied had answered the complaint,
Semitool voluntarily dismissed its action against Applied in the
Northern District of California. On the same day, Semitool filed
a substantially identical action against Applied in the United
States District Court for the District of Oregon captioned
Semitool, Inc. v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case
no. CV’01-1066 AS). On July 13, 2001, Applied
filed a declaratory judgment action against Semitool in the
Northern District of California captioned Applied Materials,
Inc. v. Semitool, Inc. (case no. CV-01-2673 BZ). In that
action, Applied sought a declaration that Applied had not
infringed the Semitool patent and that Semitool’s patent
was invalid and unenforceable. Applied also sought costs and
attorneys’ fees. The California Court transferred
Applied’s action against Semitool to the District of
Oregon. The actions were proceeding together in Oregon. As part
of a broad technology license agreement, Applied and Semitool
settled the lawsuit on February 17, 2004, and all claims
and counterclaims have been dismissed. The settlement and the
license agreement did not have a material effect on
Applied’s business, financial condition or results of
operations.

Other Legal Matters

Applied is subject to various other legal
proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that
arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, from time
to time, Applied receives notification from customers claiming
that such customers are entitled to indemnification or other
obligations from Applied related to infringement claims made
against the customers by third parties. Although the outcome of
claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not
believe that any of these other existing legal proceedings will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or
results of operations.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Introduction

Management’s Discussion and Analysis
(MD&A) is intended to facilitate an understanding of
Applied’s business and results of operations. This MD&A
should be read in conjunction with Applied’s Consolidated
Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. MD&A
consists of the following sections:

Overview

Applied develops, manufactures, markets and
services integrated circuit fabrication equipment for the
worldwide semiconductor industry. Product development and
manufacturing activities occur in North America, the United
Kingdom and Israel. Applied’s broad range of equipment and
service products are highly technical and, as a result, are sold
through a direct sales force. Customer demand for spare parts
and services is fulfilled through a global spare parts
distribution system and trained service engineers located around
the world in close proximity to customer sites.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor
industry, Applied’s results are primarily driven by
worldwide demand for integrated circuits, which in turn depends
on end-user demand for electronic products. The global
semiconductor industry is volatile. The downturn that began in
fiscal 2001 and continued into fiscal 2003 constituted what
management believes to be the longest and most severe downturn
experienced by the semiconductor equipment industry. A recovery
began in the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 and continued
throughout fiscal 2004. Applied’s results in fiscal 2002
through 2004 reflect this volatility.

The following table presents certain significant
measurements of the past three fiscal years:

During fiscal 2002 and 2003, lower sales volume
and under absorption of manufacturing and field service costs
resulted in lower gross margins. In response to the difficult
economic environment that began in fiscal 2001, Applied
implemented a series of actions that were intended to better
align Applied’s cost structure with anticipated business
conditions. During fiscal 2003, when business conditions did not
improve significantly,



Applied implemented a realignment plan, which
concluded in the first fiscal quarter of 2004. Fiscal 2002 and
2003 operating results were negatively affected by lower net
sales, reduced gross margins and charges related to realignment
activities.

Operating results for fiscal 2004 reflected a
recovery in the semiconductor industry and the global economy,
as well as Applied’s realized savings from completed
realignment activities. In addition, Applied gained market share
in critical areas, including 300mm equipment and copper
interconnect, improved operational efficiencies, and increased
its strong cash position.

Applied’s long-term opportunities depend in
part on successful execution of a growth strategy, including
increasing market share in existing markets, expanding into
related markets, and cultivating new markets and business
models. These opportunities are also subject to: (1) global
economic conditions; (2) advanced technology and/or
capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers and their
capital investment trends; (3) the profitability of
semiconductor manufacturers; (4) supply and demand for
semiconductors; (5) continued investment in RD&E and
(6) relative competitiveness of Applied’s equipment
and service products. For this and other reasons set forth in
the section entitled “Trends, Risks and
Uncertainties,” Applied’s prior results of operations
may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.

Results of Operations

Applied’s fiscal year ends on the last
Sunday in October of each year. Fiscal 2004 contained
53 weeks, whereas fiscal 2002 and 2003 each contained
52 weeks. The first fiscal quarter of 2004 contained
14 weeks, whereas the first fiscal quarter of 2002 and 2003
each contained 13 weeks.

Net Sales

Applied’s business was subject to cyclical
industry conditions in fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004. As a result
of these conditions, there were significant fluctuations in
Applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales, both within
and across fiscal years. Demand for semiconductor manufacturing
equipment has historically been volatile as a result of sudden
changes in semiconductor supply and demand and other factors,
including rapid technological advances in both semiconductor
devices and wafer fabrication processes.

Quarterly and full fiscal year financial
information follows:



Net sales by geographic region, which were
attributed to the location of the customers’ facilities,
were as follows:

(1)

Includes China.

(2)

Primarily the United States.

During fiscal year 2001, slowing worldwide demand
for semiconductors resulted in a rapid decline in demand for
semiconductor manufacturing equipment. Inventory buildups in
telecommunication products, slower than expected personal
computer sales and slower global economic growth caused
semiconductor companies to reduce their capital spending and
reschedule or cancel existing orders. This decline in demand
deepened sequentially throughout fiscal 2001 into a severe
industry downturn due to continued weakness in the
macro-economic climate and reduced consumption of electronic
products, which resulted in further capital spending cutbacks by
Applied’s customers. This industry downturn extended from
2001 through the third fiscal quarter of 2003. Beginning with
the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 and continuing into fiscal
2004, customers made increased investments in capital equipment
for capacity and technology, responding to higher spending for
consumer electronics and business information technology and an
increase in semiconductor demand.

Applied experienced a decline in demand for its
products in the first fiscal quarter of 2002. In the second
fiscal quarter of 2002, customers ordered equipment for 200mm
advanced capacity to satisfy demand driven by consumer-related
and wireless devices. Customers also continued to place
technology orders to invest in 300mm wafer processing, copper
and smaller line-width technologies. However, second quarter
demand levels proved to be unsustainable as the global economic
environment weakened through the middle of the year, and
customers reduced their level of capacity spending accordingly,
while maintaining advanced technology spending. Net sales peaked
in the third fiscal quarter of 2002 and flattened in the fourth
fiscal quarter of 2002. Included in fiscal 2002 net sales
was the remaining $9 million of revenue that was recognized
as part of the cumulative effect of implementing SAB 101.

Net sales declined 12 percent from
$5.1 billion for fiscal 2002 to $4.5 billion for
fiscal 2003. New orders declined from $1.6 billion for the
fourth fiscal quarter of 2002 to $1.0 billion for each of
the first and second fiscal quarters of 2003, reflecting the
continued and prolonged downturn in the semiconductor industry.
However, new orders increased to $1.1 billion for the third
fiscal quarter and $1.3 billion for the fourth fiscal
quarter of 2003, reflecting customers’ continued
investments in DRAM and logic and their transition to 300mm,
along with the increased capacity utilization in both advanced
and established technologies. Following these new order trends,
net sales decreased to approximately $1.1 billion for each
of the first three fiscal quarters of 2003, reflecting the
impact of the prolonged industry downturn. Net sales increased
to $1.2 billion for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003,
indicating the beginning of an industry recovery.

Net sales increased 79 percent from
$4.5 billion for fiscal 2003 to $8.0 billion for
fiscal 2004. Orders increased from $4.3 billion for fiscal
2003 to $9.0 billion for fiscal 2004, reflecting a
broad-based increase in capital investment by both DRAM and
logic manufacturers for 300mm technology to meet rising demand
for semiconductors. Following the new order trends, net sales
increased to approximately $8.0 billion for fiscal 2004,
reflecting the fulfillment of higher levels of orders for
capital equipment received in prior quarters to support
customers’ manufacturing capacity expansion and new
technology requirements.



Realignment Activities

During fiscal 2003, in response to the continuing
difficult business conditions, Applied implemented a series of
activities to better align Applied’s cost structure with
prevailing economic conditions. Realignment activities consisted
of consolidation of facilities, reductions in workforce, and
refocused product efforts, such as the electron-beam mask
pattern product line and implementation of the global spare
parts distribution system (which included the closure of a
central warehouse). As a result of the realignment activities,
Applied vacated approximately two million square feet and
reduced approximately 3,800 positions during 2003. Realignment
activities resulted in charges across multiple categories, as
incurred, including cost of products sold, research, development
and engineering (RD&E) expenses, and restructuring and asset
impairment charges. During the first fiscal quarter of 2004,
realignment activities were completed and reported as
restructuring, asset impairments and other charges as discussed
below.

Gross Margin

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales
decreased from 40.6 percent for fiscal 2002 to
35.8 percent for fiscal 2003, and then increased to
46.2 percent for fiscal 2004. In fiscal 2000, Applied
experienced unprecedented new order and revenue growth.
Accordingly, Applied expanded its manufacturing facilities to
accommodate anticipated growth. The decreased business volume in
fiscal 2001, 2002 and 2003, due to the industry downturn, was
insufficient to fully absorb the overhead costs of these
facilities, resulting in lower gross margins for all respective
periods. The continued decline in gross margin for fiscal 2003
was principally attributable to under absorption of
manufacturing and field service costs as a result of prolonged
lower business volumes, and inventory writeoffs and charges
associated with refocused product efforts, including an
electron-beam mask pattern product and implementation of the
global spare parts distribution system. The increase in gross
margin from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004 was principally
attributable to improved revenue levels, changes in product mix,
decreased product costs, and increased manufacturing volume,
resulting in higher absorption of manufacturing and field
service costs and the completion of refocused product efforts
discussed previously. The improvement in gross margin was
partially offset by increased variable compensation costs as a
result of improved operating performance.

Research, Development and
    Engineering

Applied’s future operating results depend,
to a considerable extent, on its ability to maintain a
competitive advantage in the products and services it provides.
Applied believes that it is critical to continue to make
substantial investments in RD&E to assure the availability
of innovative technology that meets the current and projected
requirements of its customers’ most advanced semiconductor
designs. Applied has historically maintained its commitment to
investing in RD&E in order to continue to offer new products
and technologies. As a result, RD&E expenses were
$1.1 billion (21 percent of net sales) for fiscal
2002, $921 million (21 percent of net sales) for
fiscal 2003 and $992 million (12 percent of net sales)
for fiscal 2004. Development cycles range from 12 to
36 months depending on whether the product is an
enhancement of existing technology or a new product. Most of
Applied’s existing product lines are the result of internal
product development activities. In certain instances, Applied
acquires technologies either in its existing areas of
development or through new product opportunities to complement
its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to
market. Throughout the periods covered by this report, Applied
has developed products designed to enable our customers to
fabricate chips with 65nm and below feature sizes, to make use
of new materials such as copper and low k dielectrics, and to
transition to 300mm wafer processing.

In fiscal 2002, Applied invested in critical
development activities to meet its customers’ rapid move to
sub-100nm dimensions in their most advanced designs, which began
entering production in fiscal 2003. This difficult and
challenging dimensional shift was compounded by the need to
provide much of the technology for both 200mm and 300mm wafers,
requiring additional process and hardware development. For the
sub-100nm chip generations, inspection and metrology tools
became more important to assure enhanced device performance as
well as adequate manufacturing yields. Accordingly, Applied
focused its RD&E resources on these technologies. In
addition, development of innovations such as atomic layer
deposition, which deposits materials in increasingly smaller
structures, and advanced wafer wet cleaning, addressed new
market opportunities for Applied. Within virtually all of the
technology areas, including fab and yield management, Applied
invested in more advanced software capabilities.



In fiscal 2003, Applied refocused its product
efforts and made investments in strategic products. Applied
focused on the development of several important processing
technologies to enable the production of new chips using copper
and low k dielectric materials, as well as to meet the
challenges of smaller, 65nm and below, feature sizes. In
addition to interconnect solutions, Applied continued to invest
resources in the development of systems for advanced transistor
designs with smaller gate structures that enable faster signal
propagation and reduced power. Applied also continued the
development of its process diagnostic and control capabilities
with systems to inspect and measure smaller dimensions and
defects.

In fiscal 2004, Applied continued its investment
in developing new technologies for future generation
manufacturing. Advances were made in several key areas,
including technology for enhancing transistor and interconnect
performance. Applied introduced ten major new products in these
areas, including the Endura2, Ecmp, Quantum X andG2 FIB systems,
all targeted for 65nm and below chip manufacturing. In addition,
Applied introduced the Gen7 AKT flat panel system.

Marketing, Selling, General and
    Administrative

Marketing, selling, general and administrative
expenses decreased from $709 million (14 percent of
net sales) for fiscal 2002 to $626 million (14 percent
of net sales) for fiscal 2003, and increased to
$752 million (9 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2004.
The decrease from fiscal 2002 to 2003 was due primarily to
headcount reductions and cost reduction activities, limiting
discretionary expenditures to align costs to lower business
volumes. The increase from fiscal 2003 to 2004 correlated to the
increase in business volume, as well as increases in variable
compensation as a result of improved operating
performance

.

Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other
    Charges

The restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2002,
2003 and 2004 were intended to better align Applied’s cost
structure with prevailing market conditions due to the industry
downturn at the time. These actions, which were necessary as a
result of reduced business volume, reduced Applied’s global
workforce and consolidated global facilities.

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges for fiscal 2002 totaled $85 million, consisting of
a charge of $8 million for acquired in-process research and
development and $77 million for restructuring and asset
impairment charges. The restructuring and asset impairment
charges consisted of $39 million for headcount reductions,
$16 million for consolidation of facilities and
$22 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset
writeoffs due to facility consolidation. Restructuring, asset
impairments and other charges for fiscal 2003 totaled
$372 million, consisting of $186 million for headcount
reductions, $86 million for consolidation of facilities and
$100 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset
writeoffs due to facility consolidation.

As of October 31, 2004, the majority of the
fiscal 2002 and 2003 restructuring actions have been completed,
and restructuring reserve balances consist principally of
remaining lease commitments associated with facilities.

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges for fiscal 2004 totaled $167 million, consisting of
$65 million for facility consolidations, $6 million
for severance and benefits, and $96 million for other
costs, primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility
consolidations.

For further details, see Note 6 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Litigation Settlements, Net

Litigation settlements, net were $27 million
for fiscal 2004 and included costs of $28 million related
to two separate patent litigation settlements, net of a gain of
$1 million related to a legal settlement in favor of
Applied.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income was $131 million for
fiscal 2002, $102 million for fiscal 2003 and
$66 million for fiscal 2004. The decrease in net interest
income in fiscal 2003 and 2004 was due primarily to lower average



portfolio yields. While there were increases in
interest rates during fiscal 2004, the benefit to interest
income on Applied’s investment portfolio was limited by the
moderate rate of portfolio turnover throughout the year.

Income Taxes

Applied’s effective income tax
provision/(benefit) rate was 21.0 percent for fiscal 2002,
(29.5) percent for fiscal 2003 and 26.1 percent for fiscal
2004. Applied’s actual effective rate of 21.0 percent
for fiscal 2002 differed from the anticipated effective rate of
29.5 percent primarily due to significant export tax
benefits, which resulted from an increase in qualified export
sales. Applied expected and experienced an actual effective
benefit rate of (29.5) percent in fiscal 2003. Applied’s
actual effective rate of 26.1 percent for fiscal 2004
differed from the anticipated effective rate of
29.5 percent primarily due to a change in estimates with
respect to foreign tax credits, export tax benefits and the
geographical composition of worldwide earnings. Applied’s
future effective income tax rate depends on various factors,
such as tax legislation, the geographic composition of
Applied’s pre-tax income and non-tax deductible expenses
incurred in connection with acquisitions.

In October 2004, the United States enacted The
American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). The Act provides
for a three year phase-out of current extraterritorial income
tax (ETI) benefits and replaces ETI with a phased-in nine
percent domestic production activity deduction that will not be
fully effective until 2010. The Act will not fully replace
Applied’s current ETI tax benefits. The Act also includes a
deduction of 85% for certain foreign earnings that are
repatriated, as defined in the Act. Applied may elect to apply
this provision to qualifying earnings repatriations. Applied is
evaluating the effects of the repatriation provision. This
provision of the Act is not expected to have a material effect
on Applied’s results of operations or financial position in
the period of implementation.

Business Combinations

On June 14, 2004, Applied acquired Torrex
Equipment Corporation, a developer of a multi-wafer system that
utilizes chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition
processes to address front-end semiconductor manufacturing
applications, for $7 million in cash. On April 18,
2003, Applied acquired Boxer Cross, Inc., a producer of in-line
monitoring systems that provide customers with critical
electrical measurement data for controlling semiconductor
processes, for $14 million in cash. On April 8, 2002,
Applied acquired Electron Vision Corporation, a designer,
manufacturer and seller of e-beam stabilization and curing tools
for the semiconductor, thin film head and micro-fabrication
industries, for $26 million in cash.

For further details, see Note 13 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Recent
Accounting Pronouncement

In June 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 03-1 (EITF 03-1), “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments.” EITF 03-1 includes new guidance for
evaluating and recording impairment losses on debt and equity
investments, as well as new disclosure requirements for
investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. Adoption
of the recognition and measurement guidance of EITF 03-1
has been temporarily deferred by the FASB, but the disclosure
requirements of EITF 03-1 are effective for Applied’s
fiscal 2004 annual consolidated financial statements.
Accordingly, additional disclosures as required by
EITF 03-1 are included in Note 2 of the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
Resources

Applied increased its cash, cash equivalents and
short-term investments from $5.5 billion at
October 26, 2003 to $6.6 billion at October 31,
2004. Applied has not undertaken any significant external
financing activities for several years.

Applied generated cash from operating activities
of $552 million for fiscal 2002, $855 million for
fiscal 2003 and $1.6 billion for fiscal 2004. The primary
sources of cash from operating activities have been net income,
as adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges, and
changes in working capital levels, including accounts receivable
and inventories. Applied utilized programs to sell accounts
receivable of $689 million for fiscal 2002,
$556 million for fiscal 2003 and $859 million for
fiscal 2004. The sales of these accounts



receivables increased cash and reduced accounts
receivable and days sales outstanding. Days sales outstanding
was 66 days at the end of fiscal 2002, compared to
68 days at the end of fiscal 2003 and 69 days at the
end of fiscal 2004. A portion of these sold accounts receivable
is subject to certain limited recourse provisions. However,
Applied has not experienced any losses under these programs.
Availability and usage of these accounts receivable sale
agreements depend on many factors, including the willingness of
financial institutions to purchase receivables and the cost of
such arrangements. For further details regarding accounts
receivable sales, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements. Inventories increased by $188 million
in fiscal 2004, which corresponds to the increase in business
volume and sales activity from fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2004.

Applied used $752 million of cash for
investing activities for fiscal 2002, $785 million for
fiscal 2003 and $353 million for fiscal 2004. Capital
expenditures were $476 million for fiscal 2002,
$265 million for fiscal 2003 and $191 million for
fiscal 2004, totaling $932 million for the past three
years. Application laboratories, equipment and related
facilities have comprised the majority of the capital spending.
Fiscal 2002 capital expenditures also included $65 million
for the purchase of properties in Santa Clara, California
that were previously held under a synthetic lease. Fiscal 2003
capital expenditures also included $52 million for the
purchase of facilities in Hillsboro, Oregon that were previously
held under a synthetic lease. Investing activities also included
purchases and sales of short-term investments and acquisitions
of technology or of other companies to allow Applied to access
new market opportunities or emerging technologies. Fiscal 2004
capital expenditures consisted principally of laboratory and
demonstration equipment.

Applied generated cash of $131 million from
financing activities for fiscal 2002 and $8 million for
fiscal 2003, and used cash of $359 million for fiscal 2004.
Financing activities included issuances and repurchases of
common stock. Since March 1996, Applied has systematically
repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to
partially fund its stock-based employee benefit and incentive
plans. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled $125 million
for fiscal 2002, $250 million for fiscal 2003 and
$650 million for fiscal 2004. Cash generated from issuances
of common stock totaled $199 million for fiscal 2002,
$323 million for fiscal 2003 and $397 million for
fiscal 2004. Financing activities also included borrowings and
repayments of debt. Applied generated cash of $88 million
in fiscal 2002 from debt borrowings, and did not borrow any cash
in fiscal years 2003 and 2004. Cash used for debt repayments
totaled $32 million for fiscal 2002, $64 million for
fiscal 2003 and $105 million for fiscal 2004.

On March 21, 2002, Applied’s Board of
Directors approved a two-for-one stock split of Applied’s
common stock, which was distributed in the form of a
100 percent stock dividend on or about April 16, 2002
to stockholders of record as of April 1, 2002.

Although cash requirements will fluctuate based
on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed
above, Applied’s management believes that cash generated
from operations, together with the liquidity provided by
existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be
sufficient to satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for
the next 12 months. For further details regarding
Applied’s operating, investing and financing activities for
each of the three years in the period ended October 31,
2004, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this
Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, Applied
provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee
instruments to certain parties as required for certain
transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As
of October 31, 2004, the maximum potential amount of future
payments that Applied could be required to make under these
guarantee agreements was approximately $55 million. Applied
has not recorded any liability in connection with these
guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately
account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied
does not believe, based on historical experience and information
currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will
be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has additional guarantee
arrangements on behalf of certain subsidiaries. As of
October 31, 2004, Applied has not recorded any liability
related to guarantees of subsidiary obligations. Applied does
not expect, based on historical experience and information
currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will
be required to be paid under these arrangements. Subsidiary
guarantees as of October 31, 2004 totaled



approximately $202 million and were
associated with the following types of arrangements: short-term
borrowing facilities, overdraft facilities, customs guarantees
and leases. In the event of use and subsequent default of these
facilities by Applied’s subsidiaries, such arrangements
would be guaranteed by Applied. In addition, certain
subsidiaries have lease arrangements guaranteed by Applied.
These leases will expire between 2009 and 2014. In the event
that the subsidiaries do not make the required payments, Applied
could be required to pay the leases on behalf of the
subsidiaries. As of October 31, 2004, annual lease
obligations under these arrangements approximated
$11 million.

Applied Materials Ventures I, L.P. (the
Fund) invests in privately-held, early-stage companies engaged
in developing systems, components and devices based on
nanotechnology and/or communications technology for specific
applications and products. The Fund is a limited partnership,
with Applied as the sole limited partner and an independent
party as the general partner. During the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004, Applied exercised its right to limit capital
contributions to the Fund to $25 million and to elect to
terminate the partnership. As a result, under the provisions of
the partnership agreement, the partnership will be dissolved,
and the activities of the partnership will be concluded six
months following the election to terminate the partnership.
Applied’s cumulative capital contributions to the Fund
totaled approximately $16 million through October 26,
2003 and $23 million through October 31, 2004. See
Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for
further details on the Fund.

Applied also has operating leases for various
facilities. Total rental expense for operating leases was
$140 million for fiscal 2002, $134 million for fiscal
2003 and $88 million for fiscal 2004.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes Applied’s
contractual obligations as of October 31, 2004:

*

Represents Applied’s agreements to purchase
    goods and services consisting of Applied’s:
    (a) outstanding purchase orders for goods and services;
    (b) contractual requirements to make specified minimum
    payments even if Applied does not take delivery of the
    contracted goods; and (c) contractual requirements to pay a
    penalty if the contract is cancelled. While the amount above
    represents Applied’s purchase agreements as of
    October 31, 2004, the actual amounts to be paid by Applied
    may be less in the event that any agreements are renegotiated,
    cancelled or terminated.

Critical Accounting Policies

The preparation of consolidated financial
statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates
that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant
accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting
policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as
defined below.

A critical accounting policy is defined as one
that is both material to the presentation of Applied’s
consolidated financial statements and requires management to
make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have
a material effect on Applied’s financial condition and
results of operations. Specifically, these policies have the
following attributes: (1) Applied is required to make
assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time
of the estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could
reasonably have



used, or changes in the estimate that are
reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on
Applied’s financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and
their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases
its estimates on historical experience and on various other
assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the
circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur,
as additional information is obtained and as Applied’s
operating environment changes. These changes have historically
been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial
statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management
is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which
are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged
periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the
section below entitled “Trends, Risks and
Uncertainties.” Based on a critical assessment of its
accounting policies and the underlying judgments and
uncertainties affecting the application of those policies,
management believes that Applied’s consolidated financial
statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America,
and provide a meaningful presentation of Applied’s
financial condition and results of operations.

Management believes that the following are
critical accounting policies:

Warranty Costs

Applied provides for the estimated cost of
warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs
are determined by analyzing specific product and historical
configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs.
Applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product
failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in
correcting product failures during the warranty period. As
Applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers
are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is
a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity
and availability of critical replacement parts is another
significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen
component failures or exceptional component performance can also
result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs
differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to
the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could
have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of
cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out
basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated
obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the
estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for
potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing
historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are
evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known
and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If
actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated,
additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete
inventory might be required, which could have a material adverse
effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

Goodwill and Intangible
    Assets

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be
recoverable, and also reviews goodwill annually in accordance
with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
(SFAS) No. 142 (SFAS 142), “Goodwill and
Other Intangible Assets.” Intangible assets, such as
purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with
a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets
is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding
expectations for the success and life cycle of products and
technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs
significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to
record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its
realizable value. The fair value of a reporting unit is
estimated using the market multiples approach, and is dependent
on market values for companies in a similar industry. A severe
decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment
charge for impaired goodwill, which could have a material
adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition
and results of operations.



Income Taxes

Applied accounts for income taxes in accordance
with SFAS No. 109 (SFAS 109), “Accounting
for Income Taxes,” which requires that deferred tax assets
and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the
effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases
of recorded assets and liabilities. SFAS 109 also requires
that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if
it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax
asset will not be realized. Management has determined that it is
more likely than not that its future taxable income will be
sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets.

Applied provides for income taxes based upon an
annual estimated effective income tax rate. The effective tax
rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of
worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing each region,
non-tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with
acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management
carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the
effective income tax rate on a timely basis. If actual results
differ from these estimates, Applied could be required to record
a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its
effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse
effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
results of operations.

The calculation of tax liabilities involves
significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties
in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these
uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applied’s
expectations could have a material impact on Applied’s
results of operations and financial condition. Applied accounts
for income tax contingencies in accordance with
SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies.”

Legal Matters

Applied is subject to various legal proceedings
and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the
ordinary course of business. Applied evaluates, among other
factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and
reasonably estimates the amount of the loss. Significant
judgment is required in both the determination of the
probability and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably
estimated. When Applied determines that it is probable that a
loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable,
the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
Although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with
certainty, Applied does not believe that any of the existing
legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations. However,
significant changes in legal proceedings and claims or the
factors considered in the evaluation of those matters could have
a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Trends, Risks and Uncertainties

The industry that Applied serves is
    volatile and unpredictable.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor
industry, Applied is subject to the industry’s business
cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which are difficult
to predict. The semiconductor industry has historically been
cyclical due to sudden changes in demand for semiconductors and
manufacturing capacity, including capacity using the latest
technology. The rate of changes in demand, including
end-customer demand, is accelerating, and the effect of these
changes on Applied is occurring sooner, exacerbating the
volatility of these cycles. These changes have affected the
timing and amounts of customers’ capital equipment
purchases and investments in technology, and continue to affect
Applied’s orders, net sales, gross margin and results of
operations.

During periods of decreasing demand for
integrated circuit manufacturing equipment, Applied must be able
to appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market
conditions and effectively motivate and retain key employees.
Conversely, during periods of increasing demand, Applied must
have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet
customer demand, and must be able to attract, retain and
motivate a sufficient number of qualified individuals. If
Applied is not able to timely align its cost structure with
business conditions and/or to effectively manage its resources
and production capacity during changes in demand, Applied’s
business, financial condition or results of operations may be
materially and adversely affected.



Applied is exposed to risks as a result of
    ongoing changes in the semiconductor industry.

The semiconductor industry is characterized by
rapid ongoing changes, including: (1) changes in
customers’ capacity requirements and capital spending,
which depend in part on customers’ inventory levels
relative to demand for their products; (2) the importance
of driving down cost of ownership of systems; (3) more
complex technology requirements; (4) the increasing
significance of consumer electronics as a driver for chip demand
and the related focus on lower prices; (5) varying levels
of business information technology spending; (6) the
growing types and varieties of integrated circuits and
applications; (7) an increasing number of applications
across multiple substrate sizes in the semiconductor industry,
resulting in divergent interests among semiconductor
manufacturers; (8) a rising percentage of business from
customers in Asia and emergence of customers and competitors in
new geographical regions; (9) customer demands for shorter
lead times for the manufacture and installation of semiconductor
manufacturing equipment; and (10) higher capital
requirements for new semiconductor fabrication plants. These
changes, individually or in combination, are increasing the need
for customer partnering, use of foundries, collaborative
research and development efforts and process integration
support. These changes also heighten the importance of spare
parts and service product offerings as a competitive advantage
for semiconductor equipment manufacturers, even though service
products historically have resulted, and may in the future
result, in lower gross margins than system products. In
addition, key integrated circuit manufacturers have become
influential in technology decisions made by their global
partners. If Applied does not successfully manage the risks
resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the
semiconductor industry, its business, financial condition and
results of operation could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied is exposed to the risks of
    operating a global business.

In fiscal 2004, more than 80 percent of
Applied’s net sales were to regions outside the United
States. Certain manufacturing facilities and suppliers of
Applied are also located outside the United States. Managing
Applied’s global operations presents challenges including,
but not limited to, those arising from periodic regional
economic downturns, global trade issues, varying regional and
geopolitical business conditions and demands, variations in
protection of intellectual property and other legal rights in
different jurisdictions, differences in the ability to develop
relationships with suppliers and other local businesses, changes
in United States and international laws and regulations,
including United States export restrictions, fluctuations in
interest and currency exchange rates, the need to provide
sufficient levels of technical support in different locations,
cultural differences and shipping delays. Many of these
challenges are present in China, a large potential market for
integrated circuit equipment and an area that Applied
anticipates will continue to present a significant opportunity
for growth over the long term. These challenges, as well as
global uncertainties with respect to: (1) economic growth
rates in various countries; (2) consumer confidence;
(3) sustainability, timing, rate and amount of demand for
electronics products and semiconductors; (4) capital
spending by semiconductor manufacturers; (5) price trends
for certain semiconductor devices; and (6) political
instability, terrorism or acts of war where Applied has
operations or sales, including Asia, Israel and the United
States, may materially and adversely affect Applied’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Applied operates in a highly competitive
    industry characterized by increasingly rapid technological
    changes.

As Applied operates in a highly competitive
environment, Applied’s future success is heavily dependent
on effective development, commercialization and customer
acceptance of its new products and services over those of its
competitors. In addition, Applied must also successfully execute
its growth strategy, including increasing market share in
existing markets, expanding into related markets, and
cultivating new markets and business models. Applied’s
success is subject to many risks, including, but not limited to,
its ability to timely and cost-effectively: (1) develop and
market new products, services and technologies; (2) improve
existing products, services and technologies; (3) expand
into or develop related and new markets for integrated circuit
products and services; (4) achieve market acceptance and
accurately forecast demand for its products and services;
(5) achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;
(6) qualify new or improved products for volume
manufacturing with its customers; (7) commence and adjust
production to meet customer demands; (8) price products and
services appropriately; and (9) lower customers’ cost
of ownership. The development, introduction and support of an
increasingly broad set of new or improved products, services and
technologies,



including those enabling the transition to
smaller device feature sizes, new materials and 300mm wafers,
have grown increasingly complex and expensive over time. Such
new or improved products and services may involve higher costs
and reduced efficiencies compared to Applied’s more
established products and services and could adversely affect
Applied’s gross margins. In addition, Applied must
successfully implement changes in its design engineering
methodology, including changes that result in: significant
decreases in material costs and cycle time; greater commonality
of platforms and types of parts used in different systems; and
more effective product life cycle management. If Applied does
not: (1) develop and introduce new or improved products,
services and technologies in a timely and cost-effective manner
in response to changing market conditions or customer
requirements; (2) price such products and services
appropriately to reflect changes in costs; or
(3) successfully implement changes in its product design
processes, its business, financial condition and results of
operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with
    a highly concentrated customer base.

Applied’s customer base is and has been
highly concentrated. Although no single customer accounted for
10 percent or more of Applied’s consolidated net sales
in fiscal 2004, orders from a relatively limited number of
manufacturers of integrated circuits have accounted for, and
likely will continue to account for, a substantial portion of
Applied’s net sales. During fiscal 2002 and 2003, there
were one and two customers, respectively, that individually
accounted for 10 percent or more of Applied’s
consolidated net sales. In addition, sales to any single
customer may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from
year to year. If customers do not place orders, or delay or
cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace this business.
As Applied’s products are configured to customer
specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may
result in significant, non-recoverable costs. Major customers
may also demand and receive pricing, payment terms or other
conditions which are less favorable to Applied. In addition,
certain customers have formed strategic alliances or
collaborative efforts that result in additional complexities in
managing individual customer relationships and transactions.
These factors could have a material adverse effect on
Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
operations.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with
    expanded service product offerings and strategic
    transactions.

In order to improve customers’ manufacturing
productivity and efficiency, Applied has entered into, and may
in the future enter into, agreements that expand its service
product offerings beyond those relating to Applied’s
systems. These service products include on-site support as well
as supply chain and spare parts management. These new service
products are offered in part through strategic relationships and
alliances formed with, or acquisitions of, other suppliers to
the semiconductor industry. In order to develop this market
opportunity, Applied must cultivate new business models, form
and maintain strategic relationships with appropriate companies,
achieve customer acceptance, and successfully and
cost-effectively provide these services. Applied’s
inability to achieve any of the foregoing could have a material
adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition
and results of operations.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with
    acquisitions.

Applied has made, and may in the future make,
acquisitions of, or significant investments in, businesses with
complementary or aligned products, services and/or technologies.
Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited
to: (1) diversion of management’s attention from other
operational matters; (2) inability to complete acquisitions
as anticipated or at all; (3) inability to realize
synergies expected to result from an acquisition;
(4) failure to commercialize purchased technologies;
(5) ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal
controls; (6) impairment of acquired intangible assets as a
result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected
performance of the acquired company or its product offerings;
(7) unknown and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities;
(8) failure to integrate and retain key employees; and
(9) ineffective integration of operations. Mergers and
acquisitions are inherently subject to significant risks, and
the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially
and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial
condition and results of operations.



Manufacturing interruptions or delays could
    affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand, while the
    failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in
    excess or obsolete inventory.

Applied’s business depends on its ability to
supply products and services that meet the rapidly changing
requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the
timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies
(collectively, parts) from suppliers. Some key parts may be
obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of
suppliers. In addition, Applied outsources certain manufacturing
activities. Significant interruptions of manufacturing
operations as a result of the failure or inability of suppliers
to timely deliver quality parts, outsourcing difficulties,
natural disasters (such as earthquakes or tornadoes), or other
causes (such as information technology or infrastructure
failures, regional economic downturns, political instability,
terrorism or acts of war) could result in delayed product or
service deliveries or manufacturing inefficiencies. Moreover, if
actual demand for Applied’s products and services is
different than expected, Applied may purchase more/ fewer parts
than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or
expediting delivery of parts. Any or all of these factors could
materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The failure to successfully implement
    outsourcing activities could adversely affect results of
    operations.

To better align costs with market conditions and
to increase productivity and operational efficiency, Applied
outsources certain functions to third parties, including
companies in India and China. These functions include
engineering, manufacturing, customer support and administrative
activities. The expanding role of third party providers has
required changes to Applied’s existing operations and its
adoption of new procedures and processes for retaining and
managing these providers. If Applied does not effectively
develop and implement its outsourcing strategy, or if third
party providers do not perform as anticipated, Applied may not
realize productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may
experience operational difficulties and increased costs, which
could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
financial condition and results of operations.

The ability to attract, retain, and
    motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s
    success.

Applied’s success depends in large part on
its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees,
including those in managerial, technical, marketing and support
roles. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to changes
in the global economy, the industry, Applied’s management
and proposed changes in accounting rules that would require
expensing of stock options. If Applied does not successfully
attract, retain and motivate key employees, Applied’s
operating results and ability to capitalize on its opportunities
may be materially and adversely affected.

Changes in tax rates or tax liabilities
    could affect future results.

As a global company, Applied is subject to
taxation in the United States and various other countries.
Significant judgment is required to determine worldwide tax
liabilities. Applied’s future tax rates could be affected
by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with
differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of Applied’s
deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in the tax laws.
For example, recent U.S. legislation governing taxation of
extraterritorial income (ETI) repealed certain export subsidies
that were prohibited by the World Trade Organization and enacted
different tax provisions. These new tax provisions are not
expected to fully offset the loss of the repealed tax provisions
and, as a result, Applied’s U.S. tax liability may
increase. In addition, Applied is subject to regular examination
of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and
other tax authorities. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood
of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these
examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for
income taxes. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are
reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final
determination will not be materially different than the
treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax
provisions and accruals.



Applied is exposed to various risks related
    to legal proceedings or claims and protection of intellectual
    property rights.

Applied from time to time is, and in the future
may be, involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent
infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust,
environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product
performance, product liability, unfair competition, employment
and other matters. In addition, Applied on occasion receives
notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them
indemnification or other obligations related to infringement
claims made against the customers by third parties. These legal
proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, are
time-consuming and expensive to prosecute or defend and divert
management’s attention and resources. There can be no
assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal
proceedings or claims. The Company has entered into a mutual
covenant-not-to-sue arrangement with one of its competitors to
avoid patent infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be
no assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will
be achieved or that Applied will be able to adequately protect
its intellectual property rights with the restrictions
associated with such a covenant. In addition, Applied’s
intellectual property rights may not provide significant
competitive advantages if they are circumvented, invalidated,
rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, or
Applied does not adequately assert these rights. Furthermore,
the laws of other countries permit the protection of
Applied’s rights to varying extents, compared to United
States laws. Applied’s success is dependent in part upon
the protection of its intellectual property and other rights.
Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party could
result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities
for Applied. If Applied is not able to resolve a claim,
negotiate a settlement of the matter, obtain necessary licenses
on commercially reasonable terms, and/or successfully prosecute
or defend its position, Applied’s business, financial
condition and results of operations could be materially and
adversely affected.

Applied will become subject to internal
    controls evaluations and attestation requirements of
    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
    2002.

Beginning in fiscal 2005, pursuant to
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, Applied must
perform and report on its evaluation of internal controls over
financial reporting, and its independent registered public
accounting firm must publicly attest to the adequacy of
management’s evaluation and the effectiveness of such
controls, on an annual basis. Applied has prepared and is
implementing a plan of action for compliance. Compliance with
these requirements is complex and time-consuming. If Applied
fails to timely or successfully comply with the requirements of
Section 404, or if Applied’s independent registered
public accounting firm does not timely attest to the evaluation,
Applied could be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and
the public’s perception of Applied may change.

Applied is exposed to various risks related
    to the regulatory environment.

Applied is subject to various risks related to:
(1) new, different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws,
rules and regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies
and/or regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied
operates and with which Applied must comply; and
(2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional
regulatory agencies related to international trade.

In addition, during fiscal 2002, Applied filed an
application with the SEC for an exemptive order confirming that
it is not subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the
Investment Company Act), which requires companies primarily
engaged in the business of investing in securities to comply
with certain additional rules and regulations. Based on
Applied’s ratios of investments to total assets and of
interest income to net income, Applied could be deemed to be
covered by the Investment Company Act. In March 2004, Applied
responded to the SEC’s request for additional and updated
information. If the SEC does not grant the exemption, Applied
may have to take other actions that could adversely affect its
results of operations in order not to be subject to the
Investment Company Act.

Applied is subject to risks of
    non-compliance with environmental and safety
    regulations.

Applied is subject to environmental and safety
regulations in connection with its business operations,
including, but not limited to, regulations related to the
development, manufacture and use of its products. Failure or
inability to comply with existing or future environmental and
safety regulations could result in



significant remediation liabilities, the
imposition of fines and/or the suspension or termination of
development, manufacture or use of certain of its products, each
of which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Item 7A:

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
    About Market Risk

Interest Rate Risk

At October 31, 2004, Applied’s
investment portfolio included fixed-income securities with a
fair value of approximately $5.8 billion. Applied’s
primary objective for investing in fixed-income securities is to
preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk.
These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will
decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on
Applied’s investment portfolio at October 31, 2004 and
October 26, 2003, an immediate 100 basis point
increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the
fair value of the portfolio of approximately $49 million
and $52 million, respectively. While an increase in
interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment
portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the
Consolidated Statement of Operations unless the individual
fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery.

Applied’s long-term debt bears interest
primarily at fixed rates. As such, Applied’s interest
expense would increase only to the extent that Applied
significantly increased the amount of variable rate obligations
outstanding. Due to the short-term nature and relatively low
amount of Applied’s variable rate obligations, an immediate
100 basis point increase in interest rates would not be
expected to have a material effect on Applied’s near-term
financial condition or results of operations.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in
foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, British pound, euro
and Israeli shekel. Applied enters into forward exchange and
currency option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all,
existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated
transactions expected to occur within 12 months. Gains and
losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that the
related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the
effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward
exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the
related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these
financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to
risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency
exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign
currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on
Applied’s results of operations for fiscal 2002, 2003 or
2004.

Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the
same currency as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese
yen, British pound, euro and Israeli shekel), and the terms of
the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the
underlying transactions. Applied’s outstanding forward
exchange contracts are marked-to-market (see Note 2 of
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), as are the majority
of the related underlying transactions being hedged; therefore,
the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange
contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect
of these changes on the underlying transactions. The effect of
an immediate 10 percent change in exchange rates on forward
exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not
expected to be material to Applied’s near-term financial
condition or results of operations. Applied’s risk with
respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium
paid for the right to exercise the option. Premiums paid for
options outstanding at October 31, 2004 were not material.

Item 9:

Changes in and Disagreements with
    Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure

On June 15, 2004, the Audit Committee of the
Board of Directors dismissed PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP (PwC) as Applied’s independent registered public
accounting firm. On June 16, 2004, the Audit Committee
engaged KPMG LLP (KPMG) as Applied’s new independent
registered public accounting firm



for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004.
The change in independent registered public accounting firm was
reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K dated
June 18, 2004.

PwC’s reports on the Consolidated Financial
Statements of Applied for the fiscal years 2002 and 2003
contained no adverse opinion or disclaimer of opinion and were
not qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principle. In connection with its audits of
Applied’s Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for
the fiscal years ended October 27, 2002 and
October 26, 2003 and through June 15, 2004, there were
no disagreements with PwC on any matter of accounting principles
or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope
or procedure, which disagreements, if not resolved to the
satisfaction of PwC, would have caused PwC to make reference
thereto in its reports on the consolidated financial statements
for such years. During Applied’s fiscal years ended
October 27, 2002 and October 26, 2003 and through
June 15, 2004, there were no “reportable events,”
as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of
Regulation S-K.

Item 9A:

Controls and Procedures

As required by Rule 13a-15(b), Applied
management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation as of the end of the
period covered by this report, of the effectiveness of
Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e). Based on that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded
that Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. As
required by Rule 13a-15(d), Applied management, including
the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, also
conducted an evaluation of Applied’s internal control over
financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred
during the fourth fiscal quarter that have materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Applied’s
internal control over financial reporting. Based on that
evaluation, there has been no such change during the fourth
fiscal quarter.

It should be noted that any system of controls,
however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable,
and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system
will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is
based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of
future events.

shown in thousands):

2000 Global Equity Incentive
Plan

The 2000 Global Equity Incentive
Plan (the 2000 Plan) was adopted effective as of June 21,
2000. The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of non-qualified
stock options to employees other than officers and directors.
The administrator of the 2000 Plan (either the Board or a
committee appointed by the Board) determines the terms and
conditions of all stock options granted; provided, however, that
(1) the exercise price generally may not be less than
100 percent of the fair market value (on the date of grant)
of the stock covered by the option, and (2) the term of
options can be no longer than 10 years (extended to up to
13 years in the event of death). A total of
147,000 shares has been authorized for issuance under the
2000 Plan, and 16,471 shares remain available for issuance
as of October 31, 2004.



30th Anniversary Stock Option
Plan

The 30th Anniversary Stock
Option Plan (the Anniversary Plan) was adopted effective as of
October 1, 1997. The Anniversary Plan provides for the
grant of non-qualified stock options to employees who, as of
November 14, 1997, were not officers. The administrator of
the Anniversary Plan (a committee appointed by the Board)
determines the terms and conditions of all stock options
granted; provided, however, that (1) the exercise price may
not be less than 100 percent of the fair market value (on
the date of grant) of the stock covered by the option, and
(2) options generally have expired under the Anniversary
Plan. Vesting fully accelerates in the event of an
optionee’s death. A total of 12,163 shares has been
authorized for issuance under the Anniversary Plan, and
4,401 shares remain unissued as of October 31, 2004.
By the express terms of the Anniversary Plan, no options may be
granted after November 15, 1997 (unless applicable law of
countries other than the U.S. requires grant dates to be
postponed).

1998 Non-Executive Employee Retention Stock
Option Plan

The 1998 Non-Executive
Employee Retention Stock Option Plan (the 1998 Plan) was adopted
effective as of September 2, 1998. The 1998 Plan provides
for the grant of non-qualified stock options to employees who,
as of October 9, 1998, were not officers. The administrator
of the 1998 Plan (a committee appointed by the Board) determines
the terms and conditions of all stock options granted; provided,
however, that (1) the exercise price may not be less than
100 percent of the fair market value (on the date of grant)
of the stock covered by the option, and (2) options
generally expire no later than November 13, 2005. Vesting
fully accelerates in the event of an optionee’s death. A
total of 10,609 shares has been authorized for issuance
under the 1998 Plan, and 3,440 shares remain unissued as of
October 31, 2004. By the express terms of the 1998 Plan, no
options may be granted after October 10, 1998 (unless
applicable law of countries other than the U.S. requires
grant dates to be postponed).

Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore
Employees

The Stock Purchase Plan for
Offshore Employees (the Offshore Plan) was adopted effective as
of October 16, 1995. The Offshore Plan provides for the
grant of stock options to employees (other than
U.S. citizens or residents) through one or more offerings.
The administrator of the Offshore Plan (the Board or a committee
appointed by the Board) determines the terms and conditions of
all options prior to the start of an offering, including the
option exercise price, number of shares covered and when an
option may be exercised. All options granted as part of an
offering must be granted on the same date. A total of
12,800 shares has been authorized for issuance under the
Offshore Plan, and 6,063 shares remain available for
issuance as of October 31, 2004.

Summary of Significant Accounting
    Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of
Presentation

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of Applied Materials,
Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied or the Company) after
elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. All
references to fiscal year apply to Applied’s fiscal year
which ends on the last Sunday in October. Fiscal 2004 contained
53 weeks, whereas fiscal 2002 and 2003 each contained
52 weeks. The first fiscal quarter of 2004 contained
14 weeks, whereas the first fiscal quarter of 2002 and 2003
each contained 13 weeks.

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ materially from those estimates.

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the fiscal 2004 financial statement presentation.

Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments

All highly-liquid investments with a
remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of
purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. All of
Applied’s short-term investments are classified as
available-for-sale at the respective balance sheet dates.
Investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded at
fair value based upon quoted market prices, and any temporary
difference between the cost and fair value of an investment is
presented as a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income. The specific identification method is used
to determine the realized gains and losses on investments.

Inventories

Inventories are generally stated at
the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a first-in,
first-out (FIFO) basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment is
stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over the estimated
useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method.
Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes are as
follows: buildings and improvements, 3 to 33 years;
demonstration and manufacturing equipment, 3 to 5 years;
software, 3 to 5 years; and furniture, fixtures and other
equipment, 3 to 15 years. Land improvements are amortized
over the shorter of 15 years or the estimated useful life.
Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of five
years or the lease term. During fiscal 2003, Applied reviewed
the estimated useful lives of its fixed assets. This analysis
indicated that estimated useful lives for certain assets should
be increased based on historical experience and other
considerations. This change in estimate resulted in
approximately $23 million less depreciation expense in
fiscal 2003 than would have been recognized under previous
estimates.

Intangible Assets

Applied adopted Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 (SFAS 142),
“Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” in the first
fiscal quarter of 2002. SFAS 142 supersedes Accounting
Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 17,
“Intangible Assets,” and discontinues the amortization
of goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 142, goodwill is no
longer amortized, but is reviewed for impairment annually during
the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Purchased technology and
other intangible assets are presented at cost, net of
accumulated amortization, and are amortized over their estimated
useful lives of 5 to 10 years using the straight-line
method.

Long-Lived Assets

Applied reviews long-lived assets for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable.
Applied assesses these assets for impairment based on estimated
future cash flows from these assets.

Research, Development and Engineering Costs

Research, development and engineering
costs are expensed as incurred.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as
incurred. Advertising costs were not material for all periods
presented.

Income Taxes

Income
tax expense/(benefit) is based on pretax earnings. Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax
consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of
assets and liabilities and their reported amounts.

Revenue Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue when all
four revenue recognition criteria have been met: persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or
services have been rendered; seller’s price to buyer is
fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Applied’s shipping terms are customarily FOB Applied
shipping point or equivalent terms. Applied’s revenue
recognition policy generally results in revenue recognition at
the following points. (1) For all transactions where legal
title passes to the customer upon shipment, Applied recognizes
revenue upon shipment for all products that have been
demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment;
the portion of revenue associated with certain
installation-related tasks is deferred based on the estimated
fair value, and that revenue is recognized upon completion of
the installation-related tasks. (2) For products that have
not been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to
shipment, revenue is recognized at customer technical
acceptance. (3) For transactions where legal title does not
pass at shipment, revenue is recognized when legal title passes
to the customer, which is typically at customer technical
acceptance. (4) For arrangements containing multiple
elements, the revenue relating to the undelivered elements is
deferred at estimated fair value until delivery of the deferred
elements. In cases where Applied has sold products that have
been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to
shipment, Applied believes that at the time of delivery, it has
an enforceable claim to amounts recognized as revenue. Spare
parts revenue is generally recognized upon shipment, and
services revenue is generally recognized over the period that
the services are provided.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Applied uses financial instruments,
such as forward exchange and currency option contracts, to hedge
a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign
currency denominated transactions expected to occur within
12 months. The terms of currency instruments used for
hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the
transactions being hedged. The purpose of Applied’s foreign
currency management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues,
costs and eventual cash flows. All of Applied’s derivative
financial instruments are recorded at fair value based upon
quoted market prices for comparable instruments. For derivative
instruments designated and qualifying as cash flow hedges of
anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is
reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income in stockholders’ equity, and is reclassified into
earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the
transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any
derivative is ineffective, the gain or loss on the associated
financial instrument is recorded immediately in earnings. For
derivative instruments used to hedge existing foreign currency
denominated assets or liabilities, the gain or loss on these
hedges is recorded immediately in earnings to offset the changes
in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.
Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for
trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Translation

Applied’s subsidiaries, with the
exception primarily of the subsidiary located in the United
Kingdom, use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency.
Accordingly, assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are
translated using exchange rates in effect at the end of the
period, except for non-monetary assets, such as inventories and
property, plant and equipment, that are translated using
historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs are translated
using average exchange rates for the period, except for costs
related to those balance sheet items that are translated using
historical exchange rates. The resulting translation gains and
losses are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations
as incurred. Applied’s subsidiary located in the United
Kingdom operates primarily using the British pound, and
therefore, the British pound has been determined to be the
functional currency for the United Kingdom subsidiary.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of this
subsidiary are translated using exchange rates in effect at the
end of the period, and revenues and costs are translated using
average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation
adjustments are presented as a separate component of accumulated
other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Prior to the second fiscal quarter of 2003,
Applied’s subsidiaries located in Japan and Europe operated
primarily using local currencies as their functional currencies.
During the second fiscal quarter of 2003, Applied reviewed the
functional currencies of its subsidiaries and determined that
the U.S. dollar was most appropriate for its subsidiaries,
with the exception of its subsidiary located in the United
Kingdom. This determination was made as a result of changes in
facts, circumstances, scope of operations and business
practices. The change in the functional currencies did not have
a material effect on Applied’s business, results of
operations or financial position for fiscal 2003.

Stock-Based Compensation

During fiscal 2003, Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 148 (SFAS 148),
“Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation —
Transition and Disclosure — an Amendment of FASB
Statement No. 123,” became effective for Applied.

Applied measures compensation expense for its
stock-based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic
value method. As the exercise price of all options granted under
these plans was not below the fair market price of the
underlying common stock on the grant date, no stock-based
employee compensation cost is recognized in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

In accordance with SFAS 148 and
SFAS No. 123 (SFAS 123), “Accounting for
Stock-Based Compensation,” Applied’s pro forma option
expense is computed using the Black-Scholes option pricing
model. This model was developed for use in estimating the value
of publicly traded options that have no vesting restrictions and
are fully transferable. Applied’s employee stock options
have characteristics significantly different from those of
traded options; therefore, in the opinion of management, the
Black-Scholes option pricing model generally used to comply with
SFAS 148 and SFAS 123 may not necessarily provide a
reliable measure of the fair value of Applied’s options.

To comply with SFAS 148, Applied is
presenting the following table to illustrate the effect on the
net income/(loss) and earnings/(loss) per share as if it had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123,
as amended, to options granted under the stock-based employee
compensation plans. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure,
the estimated value of the options is amortized ratably to
expense over the options’ vesting periods.

Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model,
the weighted average estimated fair value of employee stock
option grants was $10.87 for fiscal 2002, $6.85 for fiscal 2003
and $10.06 for fiscal 2004. The weighted average estimated fair
value of purchase rights granted under the Employees’ Stock
Purchase Plans



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

(ESPP) was $6.29 for fiscal 2002, $5.31 for
fiscal 2003 and $5.91 for fiscal 2004. In calculating pro forma
compensation, the fair value of each stock option grant and
stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted
average assumptions:

For additional information on Applied’s
employee benefit plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially
subject Applied to significant concentrations of credit risk
consist principally of cash equivalents, short-term investments,
trade accounts receivable and derivative financial instruments
used in hedging activities. Applied invests in a variety of
financial instruments, such as, but not limited to, certificates
of deposit, corporate and municipal bonds, and
U.S. Treasury and agency securities, and, by policy, limits
the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution
or commercial issuer. Applied’s customers consist of
semiconductor manufacturers located throughout the world.
Applied performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers’ financial condition and generally requires no
collateral to secure accounts receivable. Applied maintains an
allowance reserve for potentially uncollectible accounts
receivable based on its assessment of the collectibility of
accounts receivable. Applied regularly reviews the allowance by
considering factors such as historical experience, credit
quality, age of the accounts receivable balances, and current
economic conditions that may affect a customers ability to pay.
In addition, Applied utilizes letters of credit to mitigate
credit risk when considered appropriate. Applied is exposed to
credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by
counterparties to derivative financial instruments, but does not
expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is determined
using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined
using the weighted average number of common shares and
equivalents (representing the dilutive effect of stock options)
outstanding during the period.

For purposes of computing diluted earnings per
share, weighted average common share equivalents do not include
stock options with an exercise price that exceeded the average
fair market value of Applied’s common stock for the period,
as the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options to purchase shares
of common stock that were excluded from the computation were as
follows:

*

Fiscal 2003 amounts are presented for
    informational purposes only, as this period resulted in a net
    loss. As such, the basic loss per share computation was utilized.

Recent Accounting
    Pronouncement

In June 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) ratified Emerging Issues Task Force Issue
No. 03-1 (EITF 03-1), “The Meaning of
Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain
Investments.” EITF 03-1 includes new guidance for
evaluating and recording impairment losses on



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

debt and equity investments, as well as new
disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be
temporarily impaired. Adoption of the recognition and
measurement guidance of EITF 03-1 has been temporarily
deferred by the FASB, but the disclosure requirements of
EITF 03-1 are effective for Applied’s fiscal 2004
annual consolidated financial statements. Accordingly,
additional disclosures as required by EITF 03-1 are
included in Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Financial Instruments

Investments

Short-term investments by security type at
October 31, 2004 were as follows:

Short-term investments by security type at
October 26, 2003 were as follows:

Cash and cash equivalents included investments in
debt and other securities of $884 million at
October 26, 2003 and $1.5 billion at October 31,
2004.

Contractual maturities of short-term investments
at October 31, 2004 were as follows:



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

For fiscal 2003, gross realized gains on sales of
short-term investments were $44 million, and gross realized
losses were $8 million. For fiscal 2004, gross realized
gains on sales of short-term investments were $15 million,
and gross realized losses were $7 million. Applied manages
its cash equivalents and short-term investments as a single
portfolio of highly marketable securities that is intended to be
available to meet Applied’s current cash requirements.

The following table provides the breakdown of the
short-term investments with unrealized losses at
October 31, 2004:

The gross unrealized losses related to short-term
investments are primarily due to a decrease in the fair value of
debt securities as a result of an increase in interest rates
during fiscal 2004. Applied has determined that the gross
unrealized losses on its short-term investments at
October 31, 2004 are temporary in nature. Applied reviews
its investment portfolio to identify and evaluate investments
that have indications of possible impairment. Factors considered
in determining whether a loss is temporary include the length of
time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost
basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the
investee, credit quality and Applied’s ability to hold the
investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in market value.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

In accordance with
SFAS No. 133 (SFAS 133), “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended,
derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign
currency exchange contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet
at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do
not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective
portion of any hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All
of Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded
at their fair value in other current assets or accounts payable
and accrued expenses.

Applied conducts business in a number of foreign
countries, with certain transactions denominated in local
currencies, such as Japanese yen, British pound, euro and
Israeli shekel. The purpose of Applied’s foreign currency
management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues,
costs and eventual cash flows. The terms of currency instruments
used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the
timing of the transactions being hedged.

Applied uses derivative financial instruments,
such as forward exchange contracts and currency option
contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency
denominated transactions expected to occur within the next
12 months. Hedges related to anticipated transactions are
designated and documented at the inception of



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

the hedge as cash flow hedges, and are evaluated
for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of the gain
or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders’
equity, and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged
transaction affects earnings. All such amounts included in
accumulated other comprehensive income at October 31, 2004
will be reclassified to earnings within 12 months. Changes
in the fair value of currency option contracts due to changes in
time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness,
and are recognized in cost of products sold. The change in
option time value was not material for fiscal 2002, 2003 or
2004. If the transaction being hedged fails to occur, or if a
portion of any derivative is ineffective, Applied immediately
recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial
instrument in general and administrative expenses. The amounts
recognized due to anticipated transactions failing to occur were
not material for all periods presented.

Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge
certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities.
These derivatives are not designated for SFAS 133 hedge
accounting treatment. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of
these hedges are recorded immediately in earnings to offset the
changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being
hedged.

Derivative-related activity in accumulated other
comprehensive income was as follows:

Fair Value of Financial
Instruments

The carrying amounts of
Applied’s financial instruments, including cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable, and accounts
payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to the
short maturities of these financial instruments. At
October 26, 2003, the carrying amount of long-term debt was
$562 million, and the estimated fair value was
$625 million. At October 31, 2004, the carrying amount
was $456 million, and the estimated fair value was
$510 million. The estimated fair value of long-term debt is
based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or similar
issues.

Goodwill, Purchased Technology and Other
    Intangible Assets

Details of unamortized intangible assets, which
consisted solely of goodwill, were as follows:

In connection with the adoption of
SFAS No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible
Assets,” as of the beginning of fiscal 2002, goodwill is no
longer amortized but reviewed for impairment annually during the

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Applied
conducted goodwill impairment tests in fiscal 2003 and fiscal
2004, and the results of these tests indicated that
Applied’s goodwill assets were not impaired. From
October 26, 2003 to October 31, 2004, the change in
goodwill was $34 million, which consisted of
$11 million for the acquisition of Torrex Equipment
Corporation and $23 million of adjustments to the purchase
price for prior acquisitions containing contingent purchase
price provisions. For additional details, see Note 13 of
the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Details of amortized intangible assets were as
follows:

Purchased technology and other intangible assets
are amortized over their estimated useful lives of 5 to
10 years using the straight-line method. Aggregate
amortization expense was $48 million and $50 million
for fiscal 2003 and 2004, respectively. As of October 31,
2004, future estimated amortization expense is expected to be
$21 million for fiscal 2005, $15 million for fiscal
2006, $7 million for fiscal 2007, $4 million for
fiscal 2008, $2 million for fiscal 2009 and $1 million
thereafter.

Note 4

Borrowing Facilities

Applied has credit facilities for unsecured
borrowings in various currencies up to approximately
$673 million, of which $500 million is comprised of
two revolving credit agreements in the United States with a
group of banks. One agreement is a $250 million line of
credit that expires in September 2005, and is expected to be
renewed, and the other is a $250 million line of credit
that expires in September 2006. The agreements provide for
borrowings at various rates, including the lead bank’s
prime reference rate, and include financial and other covenants
with which Applied was in compliance at October 31, 2004.
No amounts were outstanding under these agreements at
October 26, 2003 or at October 31, 2004. The remaining
credit facilities of approximately $173 million are with
Japanese banks at rates indexed to their prime reference rate
and are denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts were outstanding
under these Japanese credit facilities at October 26, 2003
or at October 31, 2004.

Note 5

Long-Term Debt

Long-term debt outstanding at the end of the
fiscal year was as follows:

At October 31, 2004, $13 million of
Japanese debt was collateralized by property and equipment with
a net book value of $43 million.

Applied has debt agreements that contain
financial and other covenants. These covenants require Applied
to maintain certain minimum financial ratios. At
October 31, 2004, Applied was in compliance with all
covenants.

Aggregate debt maturities at October 31,
2004 were: $46 million in fiscal 2005; $2 million in
fiscal 2006; $202 million in fiscal 2007; $2 million
in fiscal 2008; $2 million in fiscal 2009; and
$202 million thereafter.

Note 6

Restructuring, Asset Impairments and Other
    Charges

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges included the following:

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges for fiscal 2002 totaled $85 million, consisting of
a charge of $8 million for acquired in-process research and
development and $77 million for restructuring and asset
impairment charges. The restructuring and asset impairment
charges consisted of $39 million for headcount reductions,
$16 million for consolidation of facilities and
$22 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset
writeoffs due to facility consolidation. Restructuring, asset
impairments and other charges for fiscal 2003 totaled
$372 million, consisting of $186 million for headcount
reductions, $86 million for consolidation of facilities and
$100 million for other costs, primarily fixed asset
writeoffs due to facility consolidations.

As of October 31, 2004, the majority of the
fiscal 2002 and 2003 restructuring actions have been completed,
and restructuring reserve balances consist principally of
remaining lease commitments associated with facilities.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Restructuring, asset impairments and other
charges for fiscal 2004 totaled $167 million, consisting of
$65 million for facility consolidations, $6 million
for severance and benefits, and $96 million for other
costs, primarily related to fixed asset writeoffs due to
facility consolidations.

The restructuring actions in fiscal 2002, 2003
and 2004 were taken to align Applied’s cost structure with
prevailing market conditions due to the industry downturn at the
time. These actions, which were necessary as a result of reduced
business volume, decreased Applied’s global workforce and
consolidated Applied’s global facilities.

Changes in restructuring reserves for fiscal 2003
and 2004 were as follows:

Note 7     Stockholders’
Equity

Stock Split

On
March 21, 2002, Applied’s Board of Directors approved
a two-for-one stock split of Applied’s common stock, which
was distributed in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend
on or about April 16, 2002 to stockholders of record as of
April 1, 2002. All prior period common stock and applicable
share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect this
stock dividend.

Comprehensive Income

See the Consolidated Statements of
Stockholders’ Equity for the components of comprehensive
income. Accumulated other comprehensive income consisted of the
following components:

Stock Repurchase Program

Since March 1996, Applied has
systematically repurchased shares of its common stock in the
open market to partially fund its stock-based employee benefit
and incentive plans. Upon the expiration of the previous
authorization on March 24, 2004, the Board of Directors
extended the share repurchase program and authorized the
repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of Applied’s common
stock in the open market over the succeeding three years. In
fiscal 2002, there were 6,795,000 shares repurchased at an
average price of $18.40 per share. In fiscal 2003, there were
15,588,000 shares repurchased at an average price of $16.03 per
share. In fiscal 2004, there were 37,784,000 shares repurchased
at an average price of $17.20 per share.

Note 8     Employee
Benefit Plans

Stock Options

Applied grants options to employees
and non-employee directors to purchase shares of its common
stock, at future dates, at the fair market value on the date of
grant. Options generally vest over one to four years, and
generally expire no later than seven years from the date of
grant. There were 96,874,000 shares available for grant at
October 27, 2002, 74,793,000 at October 26, 2003 and
133,878,000 shares available for grant at October 31, 2004.
Stock option activity was as follows:

The following table summarizes information with
respect to options outstanding and exercisable at
October 31, 2004:

Employees’ Stock Purchase Plan

Applied sponsors two employee stock
purchase plans for the benefit of United States (U.S.) and
international employees. The U.S. plan is qualified under
Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the
employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), substantially all employees
may purchase Applied’s common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85 percent of the lower of
the fair market value at the beginning of the offering period or
at the end of each applicable purchase period. Beginning in
December 2002, Applied amended the ESPP to extend the offering
period from 6 months to 24 months, composed of four
six-month purchase periods. ESPP contributions are limited to a
maximum of 10 percent of an employee’s eligible
compensation, up to a maximum of $6,500, per six-month purchase
period. ESPP participants are also limited to purchasing a
maximum of 1,000 shares per purchase period. Shares issued under
the ESPP were 4,127,000 for fiscal 2002, 6,212,000 for fiscal
2003 and 5,308,000 for fiscal 2004. At October 31, 2004,
there were 19,618,000 shares reserved for future issuance under
the ESPP.

Restricted Stock

During fiscal 2003, Applied issued
307,500 shares of restricted stock to two individuals, which
consisted principally of an initial compensation package for
Applied’s new President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).
On May 20, 2003, Applied issued 300,000 shares of
restricted common stock at $0.01 per share to the new President
and CEO. The closing market price of Applied’s common stock
was $13.76 per share on May 20, 2003. One half of the
shares vested on October 1, 2003, and the other half of the
shares vested on October 1, 2004. Deferred compensation was
charged for the difference between the market value of the
restricted shares and the sales price, and was presented as a
reduction of stockholders’ equity in Applied’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred compensation is amortized
as compensation expense over the vesting period. Applied
recognized general and administrative expenses of approximately
$2.7 million in fiscal 2003 and $1.4 million in fiscal
2004 in amortization expense related to restricted stock
issuances.

Employee Bonus Plans

Applied has various employee bonus
plans. A profit-sharing plan provides for the distribution of a
percentage of pre-tax profits to substantially all Applied
employees not eligible for other performance-based incentive
plans, up to a maximum percentage of compensation. Other plans
award annual bonuses to Applied’s executives and key
contributors based on the achievement of profitability and other
specific performance criteria. Applied also has agreements with
key technical employees that provide for additional compensation
related to the success of new product development and
achievement of specified profitability criteria. Charges to
expense under these plans were $99 million for fiscal 2002,
were not material for fiscal 2003 and were $309 million for
fiscal 2004.

Employee Savings and Retirement Plan

The Employee Savings and Retirement
Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and (k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Applied contributes a percentage of each
participating employee’s salary deferral contributions.
These matching contributions generally become 20 percent vested
at the end of an employee’s second year of service with
Applied, and vest 20 percent per year of service thereafter
until they become fully vested at the end of six years of
service. Prior to January 1, 2002, Company matching
contributions vested beginning at the end of an employee’s
third year of service and became fully vested at the end of
seven years of service. Effective January 1, 2004, each
participant may elect to have the Company matching contributions
invested in any of the diversified investment funds available
under the plan or in Applied’s common stock. Prior to 2004,
the Company matching contributions were invested in
Applied’s common stock. Applied’s matching
contributions under this plan were approximately
$27 million for fiscal 2002, $13 million, net of
$12 million in forfeitures, for fiscal 2003, and
$17 million, net of $8 million in forfeitures, for
fiscal 2004. Forfeitures were not material for fiscal 2002.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign
Subsidiaries

Several of Applied’s
foreign subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering
substantially all of their eligible employees. Benefits under
these plans are based on years of service and final average
compensation levels. These plans are managed in accordance with
applicable local statutes and practices. Applied deposits funds
for certain of these plans with insurance companies, pension
trustees, government-managed accounts, and/or accrues the
expense for the unfunded portion of the benefit obligation on
its consolidated financial statements. Where appropriate, the
pension plans retain professional investment managers that
invest plan assets in equity securities, fixed income
securities, cash and other institutional investments.
Applied’s practice is to fund the various pension plans in
amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements as
established by applicable local governmental oversight and
taxing authorities. Depending on the design of the plan, local
custom and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may
exceed qualified plan assets. The differences between the
aggregate accumulated benefit obligations and aggregate plan
assets of these plans totaled $69 million at
October 26, 2003 and $81 million at October 31,
2004, which have been recorded as liabilities by Applied and are
included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

A summary of the components of net periodic
pension costs and the weighted average assumptions used for net
periodic pension cost and benefit obligation calculations for
fiscal 2002, 2003 and 2004 is presented below.

Asset return assumptions are derived based on
actuarial and statistical methodologies, from analysis of
long-term historical data relevant to the country in which each
plan is in effect and the investments applicable to the
corresponding plan.

Future expected benefit payments over the next
ten fiscal years are: $4 million in fiscal 2005;
$5 million in fiscal 2006; $6 million in fiscal 2007;
$6 million in fiscal 2008; $7 million in fiscal 2009;
and $41 million collectively for fiscal years 2010 through
2014. Company contributions to these plans for fiscal 2005 are
expected to be approximately $8 million.

Executive Deferred Compensation Plan

Under the Executive Deferred
Compensation Plan, certain employees may elect to defer a
portion of their following year’s earnings. Amounts
payable, including accrued interest, under the Executive
Deferred Compensation Plan totaled $77 million at
October 26, 2003 and $81 million at October 31,
2004, which were included in other long-term liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Post-Retirement Benefits

On January 1, 1999, Applied
adopted a plan that provides medical and vision benefits to
eligible retirees who are at least age 55 and who have at least
10 years of service at their date of retirement. An
eligible retiree may elect coverage for an eligible spouse or
domestic partner who is not eligible for Medicare. Coverage
under the plan generally ends for both the retiree and spouse or
domestic partner upon becoming eligible for Medicare. This plan
has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on
Applied’s consolidated financial condition or results of
operations.

U.S. income taxes have not been provided for
approximately $370 million of cumulative undistributed
earnings of several non-U.S. subsidiaries. Applied intends
to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in operations outside of
the U.S.

As of October 31, 2004, Applied’s
federal tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were
$163 million. Management believes that tax credit
carryforwards will be utilized in future periods. If not
utilized, the federal tax credit carryforwards will begin to
expire in fiscal 2011.

Applied’s income taxes payable have been
reduced, and deferred tax assets have been increased, by the tax
benefits associated with employee stock option transactions.
These benefits, credited directly to stockholders’ equity,
amounted to $124 million for fiscal 2003 and
$101 million for fiscal 2004, with a corresponding increase
to deferred tax assets of $124 million in fiscal 2003 and a
reduction to taxes payable of $101 million in fiscal 2004.

Applied’s federal income tax returns for
fiscal years 1998 through 2001 are under examination and the
Internal Revenue Service has proposed certain adjustments.
Management believes that adequate amounts have been accrued for
any adjustments that may ultimately result from these
examinations.

Industry Segment and Foreign
    Operations

Applied operates in one segment for the
manufacture, marketing and servicing of integrated circuit
fabrication equipment. In accordance with SFAS No. 131
(SFAS 131), “Disclosures About Segments of an
Enterprise and Related Information,” Applied’s chief
operating decision-maker has been identified as the President
and CEO, who reviews operating results to make decisions about
allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire
company. All material operating units qualify for aggregation
under SFAS 131 due to their identical customer base and
similarities in: economic characteristics; nature of products
and services; and procurement, manufacturing and distribution
processes. Since Applied operates in one segment and in one
group of similar products and services, all financial segment
and product line information required by SFAS 131 can be
found in the consolidated financial statements.

Commitments and Contingencies

Leases

Applied leases some of its facilities and
equipment under non-cancelable operating leases and has options
to renew most leases, with rentals to be negotiated. Total rent
expense was $140 million for fiscal 2002, $134 million
for fiscal 2003 and $88 million for fiscal 2004. Future
minimum lease payments at October 31, 2004 were:
$84 million for fiscal 2005; $66 million for fiscal
2006; $50 million for fiscal 2007; $27 million for
fiscal 2008; $21 million for fiscal 2009; and
$79 million collectively for all periods thereafter.

Accounts Receivables Sales

Applied has agreements with various financial
institutions to sell accounts receivable from selected
customers. Applied also discounts letters of credit through
various financial institutions. Under these agreements, Applied
sold accounts receivable and discounted letters of credit in the
amounts of $689 million for fiscal 2002, $556 million
for fiscal 2003 and $859 million for fiscal 2004.
Discounting fees were not material for fiscal 2002, 2003 and
2004. At October 31, 2004, $51 million of sold
accounts receivable remained outstanding under these agreements.
A portion of these sold accounts receivable is subject to
certain recourse provisions. Applied has not experienced any
losses under these recourse provisions.

Guarantees

Applied products are generally sold with a
12-month warranty period following installation. The provision
for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is
recognized. Parts and labor are covered under the terms of the
warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based on
historical experience by product, configuration and geographic
region.

Changes in the warranty reserves were as follows:

As noted above, Applied’s products are
generally sold with a 12-month warranty. Accordingly, current
warranty provisions are related to the current year’s net
sales, and warranty consumption is associated with current and
prior year’s net sales.

During the ordinary course of business, Applied
also provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee
instruments to certain parties as required for certain
transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As
of October 31, 2004, the maximum potential amount of future
payments that Applied could be required to make under these
guarantee agreements was approximately $55 million. Applied
has not recorded any liability in connection with these
guarantee arrangements beyond that required to appropriately
account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied
does not believe, based on historical experience and information
currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will
be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has additional guarantee
arrangements on behalf of certain subsidiaries. As of
October 31, 2004, Applied has not in the past recorded any
liability related to guarantees of subsidiary obligations.
Applied does not expect, based on historical experience and
information currently available, that it is probable that any
amounts will be required to be paid in the future under these
arrangements. Subsidiary guarantees as of



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

October 31, 2004 totaled approximately
$202 million and were associated with the following types
of arrangements: short-term borrowing facilities, overdraft
facilities, customs guarantees and leases. In the event of use
and subsequent default of these facilities by Applied’s
subsidiaries, such arrangements would be guaranteed by Applied.
In addition, certain subsidiaries have lease arrangements
guaranteed by Applied. These leases will expire between 2009 and
2014. In the event that the subsidiaries do not make the
required payments, Applied could be required to pay the leases
on behalf of the subsidiaries. As of October 31, 2004,
annual lease obligations under these arrangements approximated
$11 million.

Legal Matters

On June 13, 1997, after Varian Associates,
Inc. (Varian) failed to respond to requests by Applied to
discuss certain patent issues, Applied filed a lawsuit against
Varian alleging infringement of several of Applied’s
patents concerning physical vapor deposition
(PVD) technology. On July 7, 1997, Applied amended
that action to allege infringement of those same Applied PVD
patents against Novellus Systems, Inc. (Novellus) and to add
Novellus as a defendant, as a result of Novellus’
acquisition of Varian’s thin film systems PVD business. On
June 23, 1997, Novellus filed a separate lawsuit against
Applied, alleging infringement by Applied of several PVD
technology patents that were formerly owned by Varian. Novellus
was seeking damages for past infringement, a permanent
injunction, treble damages for willful infringement,
pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees. In September
2000, Applied and Varian settled their disputes, and Applied
released all claims with respect to the Inova System, as it was
made and sold as of May 7, 1997. On October 3, 2000,
Applied’s claims against Varian and Varian’s claims
and counterclaims against Applied were dismissed with prejudice.

On September 20, 2004, Applied and Novellus
entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which
effects a full settlement of the pending lawsuits. Both lawsuits
have been dismissed with prejudice. As part of the MOU, Applied
agreed to pay Novellus $8 million and to forgive an
additional $3.5 million that Applied contended was owed
under a previous license and settlement agreement (TEOS
Agreement) between the parties. Patent licenses previously
granted under the TEOS Agreement by each of Novellus and Applied
become fully paid, as well as revocable only in limited
circumstances. The MOU contains additional covenants and
restrictions which, in general, limit the ability of each party
(including subsidiaries and permitted successors and assigns) to
sue the other, the other’s customers and, with some
exceptions, the other’s suppliers and distributors, for
infringement of any of the parties’ respective patents
covering products in technology areas in which both parties
engaged in business as of September 3, 2004 (the Effective
Date), as follows: (i) for a period of five years from the
Effective Date as to existing products, and (ii) for a
period of two years from the Effective Date (with the
possibility to extend for an additional year) as to new products
introduced after the Effective Date (Covenants Not to Sue).
Technology areas in which neither party or only one party were
engaged in business as of the Effective Date are specifically
excluded from the Covenants Not to Sue (Excluded Product Areas).
The parties further agreed to notice and cure periods prior to
filing suit on products subject to a Covenant Not to Sue that
has expired. No damages for infringement will accrue during the
Covenant Not to Sue and cure periods. The MOU contains a general
release of all claims arising prior to the Effective Date that
either Applied or Novellus may have had against the other and
the other’s customers and, with some exceptions, the
other’s suppliers and distributors, relating to
infringement of the party’s patents by any of the other
party’s products, other than those in Excluded Product
Areas. There is no license of patents, technology or trade
secrets in the MOU.

On March 12, 2002, Linear Technology Corp.
(LTC) filed a lawsuit against Applied in Santa Clara,
California, alleging claims for breach of contract, fraud and
deceit, negligent misrepresentation, suppression of fact, unfair
competition, breach of warranty, express contractual indemnity,
implied equitable indemnity and declaratory relief. After the
court dismissed many of its claims, LTC amended its complaint.
LTC’s Amended Complaint, as well as its Second, Third and
Fourth Amended Complaints, have all been dismissed by the



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

Court in whole or in part. On July 7, 2004,
LTC filed a Fifth Amended Complaint which the Court has
dismissed with prejudice. Applied believes it has meritorious
defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

On July 31, 2001, David Scharf, an
individual, filed a lawsuit against Applied alleging that
Applied has infringed, has induced others to infringe and has
contributed to others’ infringement of a patent concerning
color synthesizing scanning electron microscope technology.
Mr. Scharf seeks a preliminary and permanent injunction,
damages and costs. Applied has answered the complaint and
counterclaimed for declaratory judgment of non-infringement and
invalidity. On May 10, 2002, Mr. Scharf filed a
request for re-examination of his patent with the Patent and
Trademark Office. On June 26, 2002, the case was removed
from the Court’s active docket after the parties stipulated
to stay the case pending the results of that re-examination. On
July 11, 2002, Applied filed its own request for
re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with the Patent
and Trademark Office. Applied’s request for re-examination
was granted on September 19, 2002. On April 23, 2004,
the PTO notified Applied that it intended to issue a
re-examination certificate. On June 14, 2004, Applied filed
a second request for re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s
patent with the PTO. The second request was denied on
September 1, 2004. On October 1, 2004, Applied filed a
petition for reconsideration of that denial Applied believes it
has meritorious defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue
them vigorously.

On September 13, 2002, Varian Semiconductor
Equipment Associates, Inc. (VSEA) filed a demand for
arbitration with the American Arbitration Association asserting
that Applied has breached a patent license agreement between
Varian and Applied dated January 1, 1992. Varian seeks to
recover royalties, interest and attorneys’ fees. The
arbitration hearing on whether the products are covered by the
license agreement has concluded. On May 2, 2003, the
arbitration panel issued an interim decision finding that some,
but not all, of the products at issue were subject to the
agreement. On September 1, 2004, the arbitration panel
issued a decision in the second phase of the arbitration finding
that some, but not all, of the patent claims asserted by VSEA
were invalid. No hearing has been set to determine the amount
owed by Applied to VSEA under the agreement pursuant to the
arbitration panel’s decisions. Based on Applied’s
current assessment of this matter, Applied believes that the
amount of back royalty payments owed in connection with this
action, including interest, will not exceed $25 million, of
which $23 million was paid through October 31, 2004.
In addition to back royalty payments, Applied will be required
to make unit-based royalty payments on future sales of certain
products found to be within the scope of the Agreement. Applied
expects that these unit-based royalty payments will not have a
material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial
condition or results of operations.

On December 24, 2003, Applied filed a
provisional injunction lawsuit against Jusung Engineering Co.,
Ltd., and Jusung Pacific Co., Ltd., (collectively Jusung) in
Taiwan alleging infringement of a patent related to chemical
vapor deposition. On January 14, 2004, the Court issued a
provisional injunction order prohibiting Jusung from importing,
using, manufacturing, servicing or selling in Taiwan certain
flat panel display manufacturing equipment. Jusung Pacific
appealed that decision and on August 5, 2004, the
intermediate appellate court ruled that the injunction against
Jusung Pacific should be dissolved. The injunction against
Jusung Pacific previously had been lifted after Jusung Pacific
posted a counterbond. In December 2004, the Taiwan Supreme Court
reversed the intermediate appellate court’s decision. The
injunction against Jusung Engineering was not affected by these
decisions. On June 30, 2004, Applied filed another lawsuit
against Jusung in a different court in Taiwan seeking damages
and a permanent injunction for infringement of the same patent.
Applied believes it has meritorious claims and intends to pursue
them vigorously.

On April 10, 2004, the Taiwan Fair Trade
Commission (TFTC) notified Applied’s subsidiary AKT,
Inc. (AKT) that, pursuant to a complaint filed by Jusung,
the TFTC had begun an investigation into whether AKT violated
the Taiwan Fair Trade Act. The investigation focuses on whether
AKT violated the Taiwan Guidelines for the Review of Cases
Involving Enterprises Issuing Warning Letters for Infringement
on Copyright, Trademark and Patent Rights by allegedly notifying
customers about AKT’s patent rights and the infringement of
those rights by Jusung. On June 15, 2004, the TFTC notified
Applied that Applied also was



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

the subject of the investigation. Both Applied
and AKT have responded to the TFTC’s inquiries. Although
Applied believes there has been no violation, neither the extent
nor the outcome of the investigation can be determined at this
time. Applied believes that the outcome will not have a material
adverse effect on its financial condition or results of
operations.

Applied is subject to various other legal
proceedings and claims, either asserted or unasserted, that
arise in the ordinary course of business. In addition, from time
to time, Applied receives notification from customers claiming
that such customers are entitled to indemnification or other
obligations from Applied related to infringement claims made
against the customers by third parties. Although the outcome of
these claims cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does
not believe that any of these other existing legal matters will
have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or
results of operations.

Note 12

Litigation Settlements, Net

Net litigation settlement expense of
$27 million reported in the fiscal 2004 Consolidated
Statement of Operations consisted of costs of $28 million
related to the two patent litigation settlements with VSEA and
Novellus as discussed in Note 11 of the Consolidated
Financial Statements, net of a gain of $1 million related
to a legal settlement in favor of Applied.

Note 13

Business Combinations

On June 14, 2004, Applied acquired Torrex
Equipment Corporation, a developer of a multi-wafer system that
utilizes chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition
processes to address front-end semiconductor manufacturing
applications, for $7 million in cash. In connection with
this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of $11 million,
net of adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation,
partially offset by other items of $4 million, primarily
for net liabilities assumed upon acquisition. The in-process
research and development expense related to this transaction was
not material.

On April 18, 2003, Applied acquired Boxer
Cross, Inc., a producer of in-line monitoring systems that
provide customers with critical electrical measurement data for
controlling semiconductor processes, for $14 million in
cash. In connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded
goodwill of $18 million, net of adjustments to the initial
purchase price allocation, and purchased technology of
$3 million, partially offset by other items of
$7 million, primarily for deferred tax assets and other
liabilities. The in-process research and development expense was
not material.

On April 8, 2002, Applied acquired Electron
Vision Corporation, a designer, manufacturer and seller of
e-beam stabilization and curing tools for the semiconductor,
thin film head and micro-fabrication industries, for
$26 million in cash. In connection with this acquisition,
Applied recorded goodwill of $13 million, net of
adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation, and
purchased technology of $16 million, partially offset by
other items of $3 million, primarily for deferred tax
liabilities.

For all of the purchase business combinations
discussed above, the results of operations prior to the
acquisition dates were not material in relation to those of
Applied for any of the periods presented herein. Goodwill is not
amortized but is reviewed periodically for impairment, in
accordance with SFAS 142, and purchased technology is
amortized over its useful life of 5 to 10 years. These
acquisitions have not had, and are not expected to have, a
material effect on Applied’s financial condition or results
of operations.

Consolidation of Variable Interest
    Entities

Applied has a venture capital fund, Applied
Materials Ventures I, L.P. (the Fund), that invests in
privately-held, early-stage companies engaged in developing
systems, components and devices relating to nanotechnology
and/or communications technology for specific applications and
products. The Fund is a limited partnership, with Applied as the
sole limited partner and an independent party as the general
partner.



APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS —  (Continued)

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, Applied
exercised its right to limit capital contributions to the Fund
to $25 million and to elect to terminate the partnership.
As a result, under the provisions of the partnership agreement,
the partnership will be dissolved, and the activities of the
partnership will be concluded six months following the election
to terminate the partnership. Applied’s cumulative capital
contributions to the Fund totaled approximately $16 million
through October 26, 2003 and $23 million through
October 31, 2004.

FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
“Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an
Interpretation of ARB No. 51,” as amended, provides
guidance on the identification, classification and accounting of
variable interest entities. The Fund qualifies for consolidation
under FIN 46 and was consolidated in Applied’s
consolidated financial statements during the first fiscal
quarter of 2004. The consolidation of the Fund did not have a
material impact on Applied’s consolidated financial
condition or results of operations for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2004.

Note 15

Subsequent Event

On August 16, 2004, Applied announced that
it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
substantially all of the operating subsidiaries and businesses
of Metron Technology N.V., which provides a wide range of
outsource solutions to the semiconductor industry, for
approximately $85 million and to assume certain of its
liabilities, subject to certain closing conditions. The
acquisition was completed on December 14, 2004. The results
of operations of the acquired operating subsidiaries and
businesses of Metron Technology N.V. are not expected to have a
material effect on Applied’s fiscal 2005 financial
condition or results of operations.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT

Management is responsible for the preparation and
integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial
statements were prepared in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
appropriate under the circumstances and, accordingly, include
some amounts based on management’s best judgments and
estimates. Financial information in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K is consistent with that in the consolidated
financial statements.

Management is responsible for maintaining a
system of internal business controls and procedures to provide
reasonable assurance, at an appropriate cost/benefit
relationship, that assets are safeguarded and that transactions
are authorized, recorded and reported properly. The internal
control system is augmented by appropriate reviews by
management, written policies and guidelines, careful selection
and training of qualified personnel and a written code of
business ethics applicable to all employees of Applied and its
subsidiaries. Management believes that Applied’s internal
controls provide reasonable assurance that assets are
safeguarded against material loss from unauthorized use or
disposition and that the financial records are reliable for
preparing financial statements and other data and maintaining
accountability for assets.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors,
composed solely of Directors who are not employees or officers
of Applied, meets on a regular periodic basis with the
independent registered public accounting firm, internal auditors
and management to discuss internal business controls, auditing
and financial reporting matters. The Committee reviews with the
independent registered public accounting firm the scope and
results of the audit effort. The Committee also meets with the
independent registered public accounting firm without management
present to ensure that the independent registered public
accounting firm has free access to the Audit Committee.

The independent registered public accounting
firm, KPMG LLP, is engaged to audit the consolidated financial
statements of Applied and to conduct such tests and related
procedures as they deem necessary in accordance with generally
accepted auditing standards. The opinion of the independent
registered public accounting firm, based upon its audits of the
consolidated financial statements, is contained in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Applied Materials, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated
balance sheet of Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
Company) as of October 31, 2004, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity
and cash flows for the year then ended. In connection with our
audit of the consolidated financial statements, we also have
audited the financial statement schedule as of and for the year
ended October 31, 2004, listed at Item 15(a)(2). These
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements and financial statement
schedule based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An
audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements referred to above present fairly, in all material
respects, the financial position of Applied Materials, Inc. and
subsidiaries as of October 31, 2004, and the results of
their operations and their cash flows for the year then ended,
in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule as of and for the year ended October 31, 2004,
when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial
statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material
respects, the information set forth therein.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC
ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Stockholders and Board of Directors of
Applied Materials, Inc.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the accompanying index appearing under
Item 15(a)(1) on page 37 present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Applied Materials,
Inc. and its subsidiaries at October 26, 2003, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the
two years in the period ended October 26, 2003, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the
financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under
Item 15(a)(2) on page 37 presents fairly, in all
material respects, the information set forth therein for each of
the two years in the period ended October 26, 2003, when
read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial
statements. These financial statements and financial statement
schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
financial statements and financial statement schedule data based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in
accordance with auditing standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board of the United States. Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used
and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
