PART I

Item 1:

Business

Organized in 1967, Applied, a Delaware corporation, develops,
    manufactures, markets and services fabrication equipment for the
    worldwide semiconductor and semiconductor-related industries.
    Customers for these products include manufacturers of
    semiconductor chips and wafers, flat panel displays, and other
    electronic devices such as solar photovoltaic (PV) cells. These
    customers use what they manufacture in their own products or
    sell them to other companies for use in advanced electronic
    components.

During fiscal 2006, Applied made certain changes to its internal
    financial reporting structure and, as a result, is reporting
    four segments: Silicon, Fab Solutions, Display, and Adjacent
    Technologies. A summary of net sales, operating income,
    depreciation/amortization, capital expenditures and assets for
    reportable segments is found in Note 10 to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements. A discussion of factors potentially
    affecting Applied’s operations is set forth under
    “Risk Factors” in Item 1A, which is incorporated
    herein by reference.

Silicon
    Segment

Applied’s Silicon segment comprises a wide range of
    manufacturing equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips.
    Applied currently offers systems that perform most of the
    primary steps in the chip fabrication process, including: atomic
    layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD),
    physical vapor deposition (PVD), electrochemical plating (ECP),
    etch, ion implantation, rapid thermal processing (RTP), chemical
    mechanical planarization (CMP), wafer wet cleaning, wafer
    metrology and inspection, and systems that etch, measure and
    inspect circuit patterns on masks used in the photolithography
    process.

Most chips are built on a silicon wafer base and include a
    variety of circuit components, such as transistors and other
    devices, that are connected by multiple layers of wiring
    (interconnects). To build a chip, the transistors, capacitors
    and other circuit components are first created on the surface of
    the wafer by performing a series of processes to deposit and
    selectively remove successive film layers. Similar processes are
    then used to build the layers of wiring structures on the wafer.
    As the density of the circuit components increases to enable
    greater computing power in the same or smaller area, the
    complexity of building the chip also increases, necessitating
    more process steps to form smaller structures and more intricate
    wiring schemes. A typical, simplified process sequence for
    building the wiring portion of chips involves initially
    depositing a dielectric film layer onto the base layer of
    circuit components using a CVD system. An etch system is then
    used to create openings and patterns in the dielectric layer. To
    form the metal wiring, these openings and patterns are
    subsequently filled with conducting material using PVD

and/or

ECP
    technologies. A CMP step then polishes the wafer to achieve a
    flat surface. Additional deposition, etch and CMP steps are then
    performed to build up the layers of wiring needed to complete
    the interconnection of the circuit elements to form the chip.
    Advanced chip designs require about 500 steps involving these
    and other processes to complete the manufacturing cycle.

Over time, the semiconductor industry has migrated to
    increasingly larger wafers to build chips. The predominant wafer
    size used for volume production today is 200 millimeter (mm), or
    eight-inch, wafers, but a substantial number of advanced fabs
    now use 300mm, or

12-inch,

wafers to gain the economic advantages of a larger surface area.
    The majority of new fab capacity is 300mm. Applied offers a
    comprehensive range of systems and, through its Fab Solutions
    segment, products and services to support 200mm and 300mm wafer
    processing.

A majority of process steps used in chipmaking are performed to
    build the interconnect, a complex matrix of microscopic wires
    that carry electrical signals to connect the transistor and
    capacitor components of a chip. While some customers are still
    using aluminum as the main conducting material for the
    interconnect, many have transitioned to copper. Copper has lower
    resistance than aluminum and can carry more current in a smaller
    area. Applied is the leading supplier of systems for
    manufacturing copper-based chips, and supplies systems for
    depositing, etching and planarizing the copper interconnect
    layers.

Complementing the transition to copper to improve chip speed is
    the use of low dielectric constant (low k) films to replace
    silicon dioxide material as the insulator between the copper
    wiring structures. Applied leads the industry in providing low k
    dielectric systems to chip manufacturers and many of these
    customers use the Company’s



Applied Producer Black
    Diamond

®

system in volume production. Applied’s second-generation
    system for low k dielectric film, the Applied Producer Black
    Diamond II, further reduces the dielectric constant to
    enhance the speed of customers’ most advanced chip designs.

The transistor portion of the chip is another area in which
    semiconductor manufacturers are improving their device designs
    to enhance speed. Applied has the industry’s largest
    portfolio of technically advanced products for building smaller
    and faster transistors. One such area is strain engineering, a
    technique that stretches or compresses the space between atoms,
    allowing current to flow more quickly, thus greatly enhancing
    chip performance. Applied leads the equipment industry in
    providing solutions to enable these applications with products
    such as its Applied Producer Stress Nitride, Applied Producer
    HARP (high aspect ratio process) and Applied Centura Epi systems.

Most of Applied’s products are single-wafer systems with
    multiple process chambers attached to a base platform. Each
    wafer is processed separately in its own environment, allowing
    precise process control, while the system’s multiple
    chambers enable simultaneous, high productivity manufacturing.
    Applied sells most of its single-wafer, multi-chamber systems on
    four basic platforms: the
    Centura

®

,
    the
    Endura

®

,
    the
    Producer

®

and the
    Vantage

®

.
    These platforms currently support ALD, CVD, PVD, etch and RTP
    technologies.

The following summarizes Applied’s portfolio of products
    and their associated process technology areas reported under its
    Silicon segment.

Deposition

Deposition is a fundamental step in fabricating a chip. During
    deposition, layers of dielectric (an insulator), barrier, or
    electrically conductive (typically metal) films are deposited or
    grown on a wafer. Applied currently provides equipment to
    perform the four main types of deposition: ALD, CVD, PVD and
    ECP. In addition, Applied’s RTP systems can be used to
    perform certain types of dielectric deposition.

Atomic
    Layer Deposition

ALD is an emerging technology in which atoms are deposited one
    layer at a time to build chip structures. This technology
    enables customers to fabricate thin films of either conducting
    or insulating material with uniform coverage in

sub-nanometer

sized structures. Applied offers ALD chambers for depositing
    tungsten and tantalum nitride films. The Applied Endura
    iCuBS

tm

product is the industry’s first system to integrate ALD and
    PVD chambers on a single platform for depositing critical
    barrier and seed layers in copper interconnects. The Applied
    Centura
    iSprint

tm

Tungsten system (iSprint) combines an ALD chamber, which
    deposits a tungsten nucleation film, with a CVD tungsten bulk
    fill process in one system. The iSprint is used to form contact
    structures that connect the transistors to the wiring areas of
    the chip.

Chemical
    Vapor Deposition

CVD is used by customers to deposit dielectric and metal films
    on a wafer. During the CVD process, gases that contain atoms of
    the material to be deposited react on the wafer surface, forming
    a thin film of solid material. Films deposited by CVD may be
    silicon oxide, single-crystal epitaxial silicon, amorphous
    silicon, silicon nitride, dielectric anti-reflective coatings,
    low k dielectric (for highly efficient insulating materials),
    aluminum, titanium, titanium nitride, polysilicon, tungsten,
    refractory metals or silicides. Applied offers the following CVD
    products and technologies:

The Applied Producer CVD system

— This
    high-throughput platform features
    Twin-Chamber

tm

modules that have two single-wafer process chambers per unit. Up
    to three Twin-Chamber modules can be mounted on each Producer
    platform, giving it a simultaneous processing capacity of six
    wafers. Many dielectric CVD processes can be performed on this
    platform. Key processes that help chipmakers extend their
    current lithography tools are the Applied Producer
    APF-e

tm

(advanced patterning film) and the Applied Producer
    DARC

®

(dielectric anti-reflective coating) films. Together, they
    provide a film stack with the precise dimensional control and
    compatibility needed to cost-effectively pattern nano-scale
    features without additional integration complexity.



The Applied Centura Ultima
    HDP-CVD

®

system

— High-density plasma CVD (HDP-CVD) is used
    to fill very small, deep spaces (gap-fill) with dielectric film.
    This product is used by a number of major integrated circuit
    manufacturers for gap-fill applications, including the
    deposition of silicon oxides in substrate isolation structures,
    contacts and interconnects.

Low k Dielectric Films

— Many integrated
    circuit manufacturers are now incorporating new low k dielectric
    materials in their copper-based chip designs to further improve
    interconnect speed. The Applied Producer Black Diamond CVD low k
    system is being used by several customers in volume production
    to produce some of the industry’s most advanced devices.
    Using conventional CVD equipment, the Black Diamond product
    provides customers with a proven, cost-effective way to
    transition to this new material. The Applied Producer Black
    Diamond II is a second-generation dielectric that provides
    a lower k-value film for building faster 65 nanometer (nm)
    generation and below chip designs. A complementary low k
    dielectric, called the Applied Producer
    BLOk

tm

(Barrier low k), enables the complete, multi-layer dielectric
    structure to benefit from low k technology.

Epitaxial Deposition

— Epitaxial silicon
    (epitaxy or epi) is a layer of pure silicon grown in a uniform
    crystalline structure on the wafer to form a high quality base
    for the device circuitry. Epi technology is used in an
    increasing number of integrated circuit devices in both the
    wafer substrate and transistor areas of a chip to enhance speed.
    The Applied Centura Epi system integrates pre- and post-epi
    processes on the same system to improve film quality and reduce
    production costs. This system is also being used for
    silicon-germanium epi technology, which can reduce power usage
    and increase speed in certain types of advanced chips. For
    emerging transistor designs, the Applied Centura RP Epi system
    offers selective epi processes to enable faster transistor
    switching without the need to shrink the scale of the device.

Polysilicon Deposition

— Polysilicon is a type
    of silicon used to form portions of the transistor structure
    within the integrated circuit device. The Applied Centura
    Polygen

tm

LPCVD (low pressure chemical vapor deposition) system is a
    single-wafer, multi-chamber product that deposits thin,
    polysilicon films at high temperatures to create transistor gate
    structures. To address the challenging requirements of shrinking
    transistor gate structures, the Applied Centura DPN Gate Stack
    system integrates chambers for decoupled plasma nitridation
    (DPN), RTP anneal and polysilicon deposition on one platform to
    enable superior film quality and material properties.

Silicon Nitride Deposition

— The Applied
    Centura
    SiNgen

®

Plus

LPCVD system is a single-wafer, high-temperature
    system that deposits silicon nitride films for transistor
    applications. This system minimizes the amount of time the wafer
    is exposed to high temperatures and reduces particles while
    improving operating cost and productivity in critical transistor
    nitride layers.

Aluminum Deposition

— In fiscal 2006, the
    Company introduced its Applied CVD Al (aluminum) process
    technology for building high-density interconnects in Flash and
    DRAM memory chips. Aluminum continues to be the material used by
    many memory manufacturers for interconnects. This advanced
    process, for

sub-90nm

generations, enables customers to replace tungsten structures
    with aluminum to achieve faster chips with fewer steps and less
    cost.

Tungsten Deposition

— Tungsten is used in the
    contact area of a chip that connects the transistors to the
    wiring circuitry. In aluminum-based devices, tungsten is also
    used in the structures that connect the multiple layers of
    aluminum wiring. The Company has two products for depositing
    tungsten: the Applied
    Centura Sprint

®

Tungsten CVD system for 90nm and below devices and the Applied
    Centura iSprint ALD/CVD system for more advanced applications.
    The latter product combines ALD technology and CVD chambers on
    the same platform.

Physical
    Vapor Deposition

PVD, also called sputtering, is a physical process in which
    atoms of a gas, such as argon, are accelerated toward a metal
    target. The metal atoms chip off, or sputter away, and are then
    deposited on the wafer. Applied leads the industry in PVD
    technology with its Applied Endura PVD system. This system
    offers a broad range of advanced



deposition processes, including aluminum, aluminum alloys,
    cobalt, titanium/titanium nitride, tantalum/tantalum nitride,
    tungsten/tungsten nitride, nickel, vanadium and copper (Cu).

The Applied Endura CuBS (copper barrier/seed) PVD system is
    widely used by customers for fabricating copper-based chips.
    Using PVD technology, the system deposits critical layers that
    prevent copper material from entering other areas of the device
    and primes the structure for the subsequent deposition of bulk
    copper by electrochemical plating. In fiscal 2006, Applied
    enhanced this system with new pre-clean chamber technology,
    extending the system’s capabilities to 45nm-generation and
    below copper-low k interconnects.

The Applied Endura system’s highly flexible, multi-chamber
    architecture allows the integration of multiple PVD processes or
    combinations of metal CVD and PVD technologies on the same
    system. In addition to the integrated Applied Endura iCuBS
    ALD/PVD system (discussed in the Atomic Layer Deposition
    section), the Applied Endura
    iLB

tm

(integrated liner barrier) system combines a PVD chamber for
    depositing titanium with a CVD chamber for titanium nitride
    deposition to form critical lining layers of interconnect
    structures. These structures are subsequently filled with
    tungsten, aluminum or other materials. In fiscal 2006, Applied
    announced significant advances to its Endura iLB system to meet
    the requirements of customers’ leading-edge device designs.

Electrochemical
    Plating

Electrochemical plating is a process by which metal atoms from a
    chemical fluid (an electrolyte) are deposited on the surface of
    an immersed object. Its main application in the semiconductor
    industry is to deposit copper in interconnect wiring structures.
    This process step follows the deposition of barrier and seed
    layers that prevent the copper from contaminating other areas of
    the device and improve the adhesion of the copper film.

The Applied
    SlimCell

tm

ECP (electrochemical plating) system offers a small-volume cell
    design that enables a reduction in defect levels compared to
    conventional systems while reducing chemical consumption.

Etch

Etching is used many times throughout the integrated circuit
    manufacturing process to selectively remove material from the
    surface of a wafer. Before etching begins, the wafer is coated
    with a light-sensitive film, called photoresist. A
    photolithography process then projects the circuit pattern onto
    the wafer. Etching removes material only from areas dictated by
    the photoresist pattern. Applied offers a full range of systems
    for etching dielectric, metal and silicon films to meet the
    requirements of

sub-100nm

processing.

For dielectric applications, the Applied Centura
    eMax

®

system etches a broad range of dielectric films in the contact
    and interconnect regions of the chip. Applied’s Producer
    Etch system utilizes the Company’s Twin-Chamber Producer
    platform concept to target cost-sensitive dielectric etch
    applications in 90nm and below design geometries. To address
    advanced low k etch applications, the Applied Centura
    Enabler

®

Etch system performs etch, strip and clean steps in a single
    chamber. The Enabler’s

all-in-one

capability streamlines the process flow for 65nm and below chip
    designs and significantly reduces operating costs.

The Applied Centura
    AdvantEdge

tm

Silicon Etch system offers chipmakers high precision gate
    etching for 65nm and 45nm-generation devices. For etching
    metals, Applied launched the Applied Centura AdvantEdge Metal
    Etch system in fiscal 2006. This system enables customers to
    extend aluminum interconnect technology to

sub-70nm

dimensions for Flash and DRAM memory applications.

Ion
    Implantation

During ion implantation, silicon wafers are bombarded by a beam
    of ions, called dopants, that penetrate (or implant) the film
    surface to a desired depth. The implantation step is used during
    transistor fabrication to change electrical properties of a
    material and achieve a particular electrical performance.
    Low-energy, high current implant technology is important to
    enabling the fabrication of smaller structures, which
    contributes to faster transistor performance. The Applied
    Quantum

®

X

Plus

Implant system provides chipmakers with a
    production-worthy, single-wafer, high-current implanter that
    enables transistor scaling beyond the 45nm node. The Quantum X

Plus

system’s fixed beam and precision mechanical
    scanning system provide precise energy control and low defect
    levels to deliver the process technology needed to achieve the
    most difficult and critical implants.



Rapid
    Thermal Processing

RTP is a process in which a wafer is subjected to rapid bursts
    of intense heat that can take the wafer from room temperature to
    more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in less than 10 seconds. A rapid
    thermal process is used mainly for modifying the properties of
    deposited films. The Applied Centura
    Radiance

®

Plus

and Applied Vantage Radiance

Plus

RTP systems feature
    the same advanced RTP technology with differing platform
    designs. While the multi-chamber Centura platform offers
    exceptional process flexibility, the streamlined two-chamber
    Vantage platform is designed for dedicated high-volume
    manufacturing. These single-wafer RTP systems are also used for
    growing high quality oxide and oxynitride films, deposition
    steps that traditional large batch furnaces can no longer
    achieve with the necessary precision and control. For flash
    memory applications, the Applied Vantage
    RadOx

tm

system deposits high-performance transistor gate oxides with
    high productivity and low operating cost.

Chemical
    Mechanical Planarization

The CMP process removes material from a wafer to create a flat
    (planarized) surface. This process allows subsequent
    photolithography patterning steps to occur with greater accuracy
    and enables film layers to build with minimal height variations.
    The Company’s 200mm Applied Mirra
    Mesa

®

systems and 300mm Applied
    Reflexion

®

systems led the industry in CMP technology with important
    features such as integrated cleaning, film measurement and
    process control capabilities. The Company’s 300mm Applied
    Reflexion LK
    Ecmp

tm

system features proprietary electrochemical mechanical
    planarization technology to provide a high-performance,
    cost-effective and extendible solution for copper/low k
    interconnects at the 65nm node and below. The Ecmp system
    removes bulk copper at a high rate by electric charge, making it
    ideal for fragile ultra-low k films.

Metrology
    and Wafer Inspection

Applied offers several types of products that are used to
    measure and inspect the wafer during various stages of the
    fabrication process:

Critical
    Dimension and Defect Review Scanning Electron Microscopes
    (CD-SEMs and DR-SEMs)

Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) use an electron beam to
    form images of microscopic features, or critical dimensions
    (CDs), of a patterned wafer at extremely high magnification.
    Applied’s SEM products or systems provide customers with
    full automation, along with the high accuracy and sensitivity
    needed for measuring very small CDs. The Applied
    VeritySEM

tm

Metrology system uses proprietary SEM imaging technology to
    enable precise control of the lithography and etching processes.
    The VeritySEM measures CDs with less than 5 angstrom
    precision — a requirement for 45nm device
    production — and incorporates automation and software
    advancements for significantly higher throughput in production.
    The Company’s OPC
    Check

tm

software for the VeritySEM system performs automated
    qualification of OPC-based (optical proximity correction) chip
    designs, significantly reducing mask (see Mask Making section
    below) verification time over conventional manual methods.

DR-SEMs review defects on the wafer (such as particles,
    scratches or residues) that are first located by a defect
    detection system and then classify the defects to identify their
    source. The high-throughput, fully automatic Applied
    SEMVision

tm

G3 Defect Analysis products enable customers to use this
    technology as an integral part of their production lines to
    analyze defects as small as 30nm with industry-leading
    throughput. The Applied SEMVision G3 FIB integrates advanced
    defect review SEM capability with automated focused ion beam
    (FIB) technology in one system. The FIB provides a
    cross-sectional view of the defects reviewed by the SEM,
    enabling chipmakers to analyze the defects in minutes as part of
    their in-line review process.

Wafer
    Inspection

Using laser-based technology, defects can be detected on
    patterned wafers (wafers with printed circuit images) as they
    move between processing steps. Defects include particles, open
    circuit lines, and shorts between lines. Incorporating key
    advances in imaging technology, the Applied ComPlus
    3T

tm

Inspection system, for darkfield applications, detects defects
    in devices with design rules of 65nm and below with the high
    speed required for customers’ volume production lines. The
    Applied
    UVision

tm

Inspection system is the industry’s first laser-based 3D
    brightfield tool. Utilizing multi-beam, deep ultraviolet (DUV)
    laser illumination and high efficiency detectors, the



UVision system uncovers critical defects on the wafer that have
    not been detected before by other inspection systems, enabling
    customers to rapidly resolve performance-limiting defect issues
    and achieve greater chip yields.

Mask
    Making

Masks are used by photolithography systems to transfer
    microscopic circuit designs onto wafers. Since an imperfection
    in a mask may be replicated on the wafer, the mask must be
    virtually defect-free. Applied provides systems for etching,
    measuring and inspecting masks. The Applied Tetra II Mask
    etch system is based on the Company’s production-proven
    decoupled plasma source (DPS) wafer etch technology and is the
    semiconductor industry’s most advanced etch tool for
    fabricating masks. The Applied RETicle SEM system, built on
    Applied’s proven CD-SEM platform, measures virtually all
    mask types with

sub-1nm

precision, meeting the requirements of the industry’s most
    advanced masks.

Fab
    Solutions Segment

Through its Fab Solutions segment, Applied provides products and
    services designed to improve the performance and productivity of
    semiconductor manufacturers’ fab operations. These products
    embody the in-depth expertise and best known methods of
    Applied’s extensive global support infrastructure.

Fab Solutions serves a critical role in Applied’s ability
    to continuously support customers’ production requirements.
    Approximately 3,100 trained customer engineers and process
    support engineers are deployed in more than a dozen countries.
    These engineers are usually located at or near customers’
    fab sites and service over 20,000 installed Applied systems and
    non-Applied systems.

Applied offers a broad range of products to maintain, service
    and optimize the operations of customers’ fabs. Applied

,
    a manufacturing execution system (MES), to monitor and control
    fab manufacturing activities. This system is used in
    semiconductor fabs, test, assembly and packaging facilities, and
    flat panel display (FPD) manufacturing facilities. Applied also
    offers a suite of diagnostic software that links hardware,
    process and service data from different processing systems
    throughout the fab. The Applied
    NeXus

tm

SPC product is a new diagnostic tool that performs split-second
    analysis of process conditions in Applied’s processing
    systems.

Metron Technology, Inc. (Metron), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
    Applied Materials, offers a range of products and services for
    fab operations support. Metron’s products include fab and

sub-fab

systems, wafer management services, chamber performance
    services, gas and fluid handling components, and other services
    that are critical to semiconductor manufacturing. With
    Metron’s acquisition of ChemTrace in fiscal 2006, Metron
    now offers chipmakers a wide range of services to analyze and
    identify the sources of surface or airborne contamination.
    Metron also offers
    EcoSys

®

treatment systems to address a broad spectrum of semiconductor
    abatement applications. These energy-saving solutions enable
    chipmakers to meet their most stringent environmental goals.

Display
    Segment

Applied also manufactures and services equipment to fabricate
    flat panel displays (FPDs). These systems are used by FPD
    manufacturers to build and test thin-film transistor liquid
    crystal display (TFT-LCD) panels for televisions, computer
    displays and other consumer-oriented electronic applications.
    While similarities exist between the technologies utilized in
    chipmaking and display fabrication, there are significant
    differences, such as in the size and composition of the
    substrate (wafer

vs.

panel). FPD panels can be more than
    70 times larger in area than today’s largest wafers (300mm
    diameter), and wafers are made of silicon, while FPD panels are
    made of glass.

Applied supplies a wide range of systems that process and test
    many different panel sizes. To meet consumers’ growing
    demand for larger, more cost-efficient LCD TVs, FPD
    manufacturers have continually increased the size of panels that
    can be processed. Leading-edge substrates, sized at 2.2 x 2.5
    meters (m), now processed by Generation



(Gen) 8.5 systems, are designed to enable the production of up
    to six

55-inch

LCD
    TV screens. Applied announced three new systems for
    manufacturing Gen-8.5 panels in October 2006.

The AKT-55K PECVD (plasma-enhanced CVD) system, used for
    fabricating the transistor layer of Gen-8.5 panels, features
    Applied’s multi-chamber platform architecture. For
    fabricating the color filter layer of these panels, Applied
    offers a fully automated vertical sputtering system, the AKT-NEW
    ARISTO

tm

2200. Applied acquired the NEW
    ARISTO

tm

technology during fiscal 2006 as part of its acquisition of
    Applied Films Corporation (Applied Films).

Complementing these systems, Applied also offers electron beam
    systems for testing substrates during production for defective
    pixels and other imperfections. The AKT-55K EBT is a Gen-8.5
    tester that features one of the industry’s fastest and most
    accurate pixel test technology with the lowest operating cost.
    The electron beam system’s non-contact test technology
    enables safe testing of high-value LCD TV panels without
    damaging or scratching the display.

Adjacent
    Technologies Segment

The acquisition of Applied Films, a supplier of thin film
    deposition equipment, accelerated Applied’s entry into
    growing new markets, such as solar PV cells, flexible
    electronics and energy-efficient glass.

In the solar PV area, Applied offers a suite of manufacturing
    systems to enable customers to increase the conversion
    efficiency and yields of their PV devices, thus helping to lower
    the overall cost per watt for solar electricity. These include
    equipment as well as processes, material-handling technologies
    and services to support the manufacture of both
    crystalline-silicon and thin-film silicon solar cells.
    Applied’s
    ATON

tm

in-line sputtering system provides quality deposition, high
    throughput and low cost of ownership for both thin-film and
    multi-or mono-crystalline silicon.

Applied also provides high-performance,

roll-to-roll

vacuum web coating systems for depositing a wide range of films
    on flexible substrates for functional, aesthetic or optical
    properties. The
    TOPMET

tm

system is capable of handling substrates in roll widths from
    1.25-4.5m with high throughput and low cost of ownership.

Applied offers large-area sputter coating equipment for the
    production of low-emissivity and solar control architectural
    glass. The AXL

tm

coating system is a highly flexible and cost-effective tool that
    customers can easily reconfigure to produce a variety of
    products to meet the challenges of a changing market.

Backlog

Applied’s backlog increased from $2.6 billion at
    October 30, 2005 to $3.4 billion at October 29,
    2006. Applied manufactures its systems based on order backlog
    and customer commitments. Backlog includes only orders for which
    written authorizations have been accepted and shipment dates
    within 12 months have been assigned, or shipment has
    occurred but revenue has not been recognized, and also includes
    contractual service revenue and maintenance fees to be earned
    within the next 12 months. Backlog increased
    $285 million as a result of the acquisition of Applied
    Films during fiscal 2006. Backlog adjustments for fiscal 2006
    totaled $194 million, which consisted primarily of
    cancellations and currency adjustments. Customers may delay
    delivery of products or cancel orders prior to shipment, subject
    to possible cancellation penalties. Due to possible changes in
    delivery schedules and cancellations of orders, Applied’s
    backlog on any particular date is not necessarily indicative of
    actual sales for any succeeding period. Delays in delivery
    schedules

and/or

a
    reduction of backlog during any particular period could have a
    material adverse effect on Applied’s business and results
    of operations.

Manufacturing,
    Raw Materials and Supplies

Applied’s manufacturing activities consist primarily of
    assembling various commercial and proprietary components into
    finished systems. Products in the Silicon segment are
    manufactured in Austin, Texas; Horsham, England; and Rehovot,
    Israel. Remanufactured products in the Fab Solutions segment are
    produced primarily in Austin, Texas. Products in the Display
    segment are manufactured in Santa Clara, California;
    Alzenau, Germany; and Tainan, Taiwan. Products in the Adjacent
    Technologies segment are primarily manufactured in Alzenau,
    Germany. Manufacturing requires raw materials, including a wide
    variety of mechanical and electrical components,



to be manufactured to Applied’s specifications. Applied
    uses numerous companies to supply parts, components and
    subassemblies (parts) for the manufacture and support of its
    products. Although Applied makes reasonable efforts to assure
    that parts are available from multiple qualified suppliers, this
    is not always possible. Accordingly, some key parts may be
    obtained from only a single supplier or a limited group of
    suppliers. Applied will continue to seek to reduce costs and to
    lower the risks of production and service interruptions, as well
    as shortages of key parts, by: (1) qualifying and selecting
    alternate suppliers for key parts; (2) monitoring the
    financial condition of key suppliers; (3) maintaining
    appropriate inventories of key parts; and (4) qualifying
    new parts on a timely basis.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s long-term growth strategy requires continued
    development of new products. Applied’s significant
    investment in research, development and engineering (RD&E)
    has generally enabled it to deliver new products and
    technologies before the emergence of strong demand, thus
    allowing customers to incorporate these products into their
    manufacturing plans at an early stage in the technology
    selection cycle. Applied works closely with its global customers
    to design systems and processes that meet their planned
    technical and production requirements. Product development and
    engineering organizations are located primarily in the United
    States, as well as in Europe and Israel. In addition, Applied
    outsources certain RD&E activities, some of which are
    performed outside the United States. Process support and
    customer demonstration laboratories are located in the United
    States, Europe and Israel.

Applied invested $992 million (12 percent of net
    sales) for fiscal 2004, $941 million (13 percent of
    net sales) for fiscal 2005 and $1.2 billion
    (13 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2006 in RD&E for
    product development and engineering programs to create new
    products and to improve existing technologies and products.
    Applied has spent an average of 15 percent of net sales on
    RD&E over the last five years. In addition to RD&E for
    specific product technologies, Applied maintains ongoing
    programs for automation control systems, materials research and
    environmental control that have applications to its products. In
    fiscal 2006, Applied focused on developing systems for
    customers’ new chip designs with 65nm and below geometries,
    including systems to enable faster and denser transistor and
    interconnect structures.

Marketing
    and Sales

Applied manages its business and reports financial results based
    on the segments described above. Because of the highly technical
    nature of the products, Applied markets and sells products
    worldwide through a direct sales force. For fiscal 2006, net
    sales to customers in each region as a percentage of
    Applied’s total net sales were: Taiwan 23 percent,
    North America (primarily the United States) 19 percent,
    Korea 18 percent, Japan 16 percent, Asia-Pacific
    (including China) 13 percent, and Europe 11 percent.

General economic conditions impact Applied’s business and
    financial results. From time to time, the markets in which
    products are sold experience weak economic conditions that may
    negatively impact sales. Applied’s business is usually not
    seasonal in nature, but it is cyclical, based on capital
    equipment investment by major semiconductor, flat panel display
    and other manufacturers. These expenditures depend on many
    factors, including anticipated market demand and pricing for
    semiconductors, flat panel displays, solar cells, architectural
    glass and other substrates; the development of new technologies;
    factory utilization; and global and regional economic conditions.

During fiscal 2006, more than 80 percent of Applied’s
    net sales were to regions outside of the United States. Managing
    Applied’s global operations presents challenges and
    involves uncertainties that may affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Information on net sales to unaffiliated customers and
    long-lived assets attributable to Applied’s geographic
    regions is included in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements. During fiscal 2004, no individual customer
    accounted for more than 10 percent of Applied’s net
    sales. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. accounted for
    10 percent of Applied’s net sales in 2005 and
    11 percent of Applied’s net sales in 2006. These net
    sales were for products in multiple reportable segments.



Competition

The global semiconductor equipment and related industries are
    highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological
    change. Applied’s ability to compete depends primarily on
    its ability to commercialize its technology, continually improve
    its products and develop new products that meet constantly
    evolving customer requirements. Significant competitive factors
    include technical capability and differentiation, productivity
    and cost-effectiveness. The importance of these factors varies
    according to customers’ needs, including product
    requirements, applications and the timing and circumstances of
    purchasing decisions. Substantial competition exists in all
    areas of Applied’s business. Competitors range from small
    companies that compete with a single product

and/or

in a
    single region, to global companies with a range of products.
    Applied’s ability to compete requires a high level of
    investment in RD&E and in marketing, sales and customer
    support activities. Management believes that Applied’s
    products have strong competitive positions. Applied is a global
    leader in the semiconductor equipment and related markets. In
    addition, Applied is expanding into adjacent markets where
    customers may benefit from the Company’s expertise in
    nanomanufacturing technologies.

The competitive environment for each segment is described below:

Products within the Silicon segment are subject to rapid change,
    with customers frequently moving to smaller dimensions, larger
    wafer sizes and new materials for fabricating chips. While
    certain existing technologies may be adapted to new
    requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely
    different technical approach. The rapid pace of technological
    change creates opportunities for many existing and new
    competitors, and can quickly diminish the value of current
    technologies. To compete effectively, Applied must offer a broad
    portfolio of technically differentiated products. Applied must
    allocate resources across these products and may not fund or
    invest in individual products to the same degree as competitors
    who specialize in fewer products.

Products and services within the Fab Solutions segment are
    subject to a highly competitive environment characterized by
    demanding worldwide service requirements and a diverse group of
    competitors. To compete effectively, Applied must offer products
    and services to help reduce costs and improve the productivity
    of customers’ fab operations. Significant competitive
    factors include productivity, cost-effectiveness, and the level
    of technical service and support. The importance of these
    factors varies according to customers’ needs and the type
    of products or services offered.

Products and services within the Display segment are highly
    specialized, with a limited number of major competitors located
    primarily in Asia. Applied is the leader in PECVD and color
    filter (CF) sputtering equipment markets and is a leader in the
    array test equipment market. Applied has recently entered the
    PVD market.

Products and services within the Adjacent Technologies segment
    compete in diverse markets, including solar, flexible
    electronics and energy-efficient glass. Applied has recently
    entered these markets, which have established competitors. In
    solar, Applied offers products utilizing two distinct
    technologies, wafer-based and thin film, and is focused on the
    emerging thin film area. Flexible electronics equipment competes
    in a relatively fragmented market. Applied’s glass coating
    equipment has one major competitor.

Patents
    and Licenses

Management believes that Applied’s competitive position is
    significantly dependent upon its skills in research,
    development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing, and not
    just on its patent position. However, protection of
    Applied’s technological assets by obtaining and enforcing
    intellectual property rights, including patents, is important.
    Therefore, Applied’s practice is to file patent
    applications in the United States and other countries for
    inventions that Applied considers significant. Applied has a
    substantial number of patents in the United States and other
    countries, and additional applications are pending for new
    developments. Although Applied does not consider its business
    materially dependent upon any one patent, the rights of Applied
    and the products made and sold under its patents, taken as a
    whole, are a significant element of Applied’s business. In
    addition to patents, Applied also possesses other intellectual
    property, including trademarks, knowhow, trade secrets and
    copyrights.

Applied enters into patent and technology licensing agreements
    with other companies when management determines that it is in
    its best interest to do so. Applied pays royalties under
    existing patent license agreements for the use, in several of
    its products, of certain patented technologies that are licensed
    to Applied for the life of the



patents. Applied also receives royalties from licenses granted
    to third parties. Royalties received from and paid to third
    parties have not been and are not expected to be material in
    relation to Applied’s consolidated results of operations.

In the normal course of business, Applied periodically receives
    and makes inquiries regarding possible patent infringement. In
    dealing with such inquiries, it may become necessary or useful
    for Applied to obtain or grant licenses or other rights.
    However, there can be no assurance that such licenses or rights
    will be available to Applied on commercially reasonable terms.
    If Applied is not able to resolve or settle claims, obtain
    necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms

and/or

successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Environmental
    Matters

Two of Applied’s locations have been designated as
    environmental cleanup sites. In 1987, the United States
    Environmental Protection Agency designated one of the locations,
    in Santa Clara, California, as a Superfund site and named
    Applied as a “Responsible Party.” Cleanup activities
    at this site began in 1984 and were substantially completed in
    February 2002. The California Regional Water Quality Control
    Board designated Applied as a “Discharger” with
    respect to another site in Sunnyvale, California. Applied was
    named a Discharger upon its acquisition of the property in 1997
    solely due to its status as property owner. The prior owners of
    the site

and/or

operators who caused the contamination are responsible for
    performing cleanup and monitoring activities. In addition,
    Applied has become aware of soil and groundwater contamination
    at levels exceeding regulatory requirements at its facility in
    Narita, Japan, which it believes was caused by a former owner or
    operator of the property. Applied is continuing its
    investigation of the contamination and is working with local
    authorities to determine what further action may be required.

Applied maintains a number of environmental, health and safety
    programs that are primarily preventive in nature. As part of
    these programs, Applied regularly monitors ongoing compliance
    and periodically conducts investigations of possible
    contamination.

Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating
    discharge of materials into the environment, remedial agreements
    and other actions relating to the environment have not had, and
    are not expected to have, a material effect on Applied’s
    capital expenditures, competitive position, financial condition
    or results of operations.

The most recent report on Applied’s environmental, health
    and safety activities can be found on the Company’s website

Employees

At October 29, 2006, Applied employed 14,072 regular
    employees and 1,033 temporary employees. In the high-technology
    industry, competition for highly-skilled employees is intense.
    Applied believes that its future success is highly dependent
    upon its continued ability to attract, retain and motivate
    qualified employees. There can be no assurance that Applied will
    be able to attract, hire, assimilate and retain a sufficient
    number of qualified employees.

Item 1A:

Risk
    Factors

The
    industries that Applied serves is volatile and
    unpredictable.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor and
    semiconductor-related industries, Applied is subject to business
    cycles, the timing, length and volatility of which can be
    difficult to predict. The industries have historically been
    cyclical due to sudden changes in demand and manufacturing
    capacity, including capacity using the latest technology. The
    effect on Applied of these changes in demand, including
    end-customer demand, is occurring more rapidly, exacerbating the
    volatility of these cycles. These changes have affected the
    timing and amounts of customers’ purchases and investments
    in technology, and continue to affect Applied’s orders, net
    sales, gross margin, contributed profit and results of
    operations.

Applied must effectively manage its resources and production
    capacity to meet changing demand. During periods of increasing
    demand for semiconductor and semiconductor-related manufacturing
    equipment, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity
    and inventory to meet customer demand and must be able to
    attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified
    individuals and effectively manage its supply chain. During
    periods of decreasing demand, Applied must be able to
    appropriately align its cost structure with prevailing market
    conditions, effectively motivate and retain key employees, and
    effectively manage its supply chain. If Applied is not able to
    timely and appropriately align its cost structure with business
    conditions

and/or

effectively manage its resources and production capacity,
    including its supply chain, during changes in demand,
    Applied’s business, financial condition or results of
    operations may be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the
    semiconductor and

semiconductor-related

industries.

The global industries in which Applied operates are
    characterized by ongoing changes, including: (1) changes in
    customers’ capacity requirements, capacity utilization and
    capital spending, which depend in part on the demand for
    customers’ products and their inventory levels relative to
    demand; (2) the importance of reducing the cost of system
    ownership, due in part to the increasing significance of
    consumer electronics as a driver for semiconductor and display
    demand and the related focus on lower prices; (3) varying
    levels of business information technology spending;
    (4) increasingly complex technology requirements, including
    a significant rise in the number and importance of new materials
    and importance of expertise in chemical processes and device
    structure; (5) the growing types and varieties of
    semiconductors and expanding number of applications across
    multiple substrate sizes, resulting in customers’ divergent
    technical demands and different rates of spending on capital
    equipment; (6) customers’ varying adoption rates of
    new technology; (7) a rising percentage of business from
    customers in Asia and the emergence of customers, competitors
    and suppliers in new geographical regions; (8) demand for
    shorter cycle times for the development, manufacture and
    installation of manufacturing equipment; (9) the heightened
    importance to customers of system reliability and productivity,
    and the effect on demand for systems as a result of their
    increasing productivity, device yield and reliability;
    (10) differing rates of market growth for, and capital
    investments by, various semiconductor device makers, such as
    memory (including NAND flash and DRAM), logic, foundry, display
    and solar; (11) customers’ increasing use of
    partnerships, alliances, joint ventures and industry consortia,
    which has increased the influence of key integrated circuit
    manufacturers in technology decisions made by their global
    partners; (12) higher capital requirements for building and
    operating new semiconductor fabrication plants; (13) the
    increasing difficulty for customers to move from product design
    to volume manufacturing; (14) the challenge to
    semiconductor manufacturers of moving volume manufacturing from
    one technology node to the next smaller technology node and the
    resulting impact on the technology transition rate;
    (15) the increasing cost and reduced affordability of
    research and development due to many factors, including
    decreasing linewidths and the increasing number of materials,
    applications and process steps; (16) the industry growth
    rate; (17) the increasing importance of the availability of
    spare parts to assure maximum system uptime; (18) concern
    among United States governmental agencies regarding possible
    national commercial

and/or

security issues posed by the growing manufacturing business in
    Asia; and (19) the increasing importance of operating
    flexibility to enable different responses to different markets,
    customers and applications. The solar market, which Applied
    recently entered, is



also characterized by ongoing changes in demand for PV products
    arising from, among other things, fluctuations in the cost of
    fossil fuels and electric power, availability of government
    subsidies, the performance and reliability of PV technology, and
    the success of other renewable energy sources. If Applied does
    not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing
    changes occurring in the semiconductor and semiconductor-related
    industries, its business, financial condition and results of
    operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    must adapt its business and product offerings to respond to
    competition and rapid technological changes.

As Applied operates in a highly competitive environment, its
    future success depends on many factors, including the effective
    development, commercialization and customer acceptance of its
    nanomanufacturing technology equipment, service and related
    products. In addition, Applied must successfully execute its
    growth strategy, including enhancing market share in existing
    markets, expanding into related markets, and cultivating new
    markets and new business models, while constantly improving its
    operational performance. The development, introduction and
    support of a broadening set of products in more varied
    competitive environments have grown increasingly complex and
    expensive over time. Applied’s success is subject to many
    risks, including but not limited to its ability to timely,
    cost-effectively and successfully: (1) improve and develop
    new applications for existing products and increase market share
    in its existing markets; (2) develop, appropriately price,
    and achieve market acceptance of new products; (3) expand
    into or develop related and new markets for its
    nanomanufacturing technology; (4) anticipate and capitalize
    on opportunities in new markets, such as solar, and with new
    technologies; (5) supply a range of Applied and non-Applied
    products as part of its solar offerings; (6) appropriately
    allocate resources, including RD&E funding, among
    Applied’s products and between the development of new
    products and the improvement of existing products;
    (7) accurately forecast demand and meet production
    schedules for its products; (8) achieve cost efficiencies
    across product offerings; (9) adapt to technology changes
    in related markets, such as lithography; (10) develop,
    market and price similar products for use by customers in
    different applications

and/or

markets that may have varying technical requirements;
    (11) adapt to changes in value offered by companies in
    different parts of the supply chain; (12) qualify products
    for volume manufacturing with its customers; (13) implement
    changes in its design engineering methodology, including those
    that enable significant decreases in material costs and cycle
    time, greater commonality of platforms and types of parts used
    in different systems, and effective product life cycle
    management; (14) improve its manufacturing processes; and
    (15) deploy initiatives to transform Applied’s
    information technology systems and enhance business processes,
    including transitioning to a single-vendor enterprise resource
    planning (ERP) software system. Furthermore, new or improved
    products may involve higher costs and reduced efficiencies
    compared to Applied’s more established products and could
    adversely affect Applied’s gross margins. Also, entry into
    new markets entails additional challenges, including those
    arising from changes in Applied’s customer

and/or

supplier base. In addition, Applied must regularly reassess the
    size, capability and location of its global infrastructure and
    timely make appropriate changes in its real estate and
    facilities portfolio. If Applied does not successfully manage
    these challenges, its business, financial condition and results
    of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is exposed to the risks of operating a global
    business.

In fiscal 2006, more than 80 percent of Applied’s net
    sales were to customers in regions outside the United States.
    Certain of Applied’s RD&E and manufacturing facilities,
    as well as suppliers to Applied, are also located outside the
    United States. Managing Applied’s global operations
    presents challenges, including but not limited to, those arising
    from: (1) varying regional and geopolitical business
    conditions and demands; (2) global trade issues;
    (3) variations in protection of intellectual property and
    other legal rights in different countries; (4) fluctuating
    raw material and energy costs; (5) variations in the
    ability to develop relationships with suppliers and other local
    businesses; (6) changes in laws and regulations of the
    United States (including export restrictions) and other
    countries, as well as their interpretation and application;
    (7) fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange
    rates; (8) the need to provide sufficient levels of
    technical support in different locations; (9) political
    instability, natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or
    storms), pandemics, terrorism or acts of war where Applied has
    operations, suppliers or sales; (10) cultural differences;
    (11) special customer- or government-supported efforts to
    promote the development and growth of local competitors; and
    (12) shipping costs

and/or

delays. Many of these challenges are present in China, which is
    experiencing significant growth of both suppliers and
    prospective



competitors to Applied, and which Applied believes presents a
    large potential market for its products and opportunity for
    growth over the long term. These challenges, as well as global
    uncertainties with respect to: (1) economic growth rates in
    various countries; (2) consumer confidence; (3) the
    sustainability, timing, rate and amount of demand for
    electronics products and integrated circuits; (4) capital
    and operational spending by semiconductor and display
    manufacturers; and (5) price trends for certain integrated
    circuit devices, may materially and adversely affect
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated
    customer base.

Applied’s customer base is and has historically been highly
    concentrated. Orders from a relatively limited number of
    manufacturers have accounted for, and are expected to continue
    to account for, a substantial portion of Applied’s net
    sales. In addition, the mix and type of customers, and sales to
    any single customer, may vary significantly from quarter to
    quarter and from year to year. Moreover, certain customers,
    particularly in emerging areas such as solar, may have capital
    resource constraints

and/or

a
    limited operating history. If customers do not place orders, or
    they delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace
    the business. As Applied’s products are configured to
    customer specifications, changing, rescheduling or canceling
    orders may result in significant non- recoverable costs. Major
    customers may also seek, and on occasion receive, pricing,
    payment, intellectual property-related or other commercial terms
    that are less favorable to Applied. In addition, certain
    customers have undergone significant ownership changes

and/or

formed strategic alliances or collaborative efforts, which may
    result in additional complexities in managing customer
    relationships and transactions. These factors could have a
    material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial
    condition and results of operations.

Manufacturing
    interruptions or delays could affect Applied’s ability to
    meet customer demand, while the failure to estimate customer
    demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete
    inventory.

Applied’s business depends on its ability to supply
    equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly
    changing requirements of its customers, which depends in part on
    the timely delivery of parts, components and subassemblies
    (collectively, parts) from suppliers. Some key parts may be
    subject to long lead-times

and/or

obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of
    suppliers, and some sourcing or subassembly is provided by
    suppliers in developing regions, including China. In addition,
    Applied has implemented several key operational initiatives
    intended to improve manufacturing efficiency, including

integrate-to-order,

module-final-test and

merge-in-transit

programs. Applied has also begun a multi-year, company-wide
    program to transform certain business processes that includes
    transitioning to a single-vendor enterprise resource planning
    (ERP) software system to perform various functions, such as
    order management and manufacturing control. Significant
    interruptions of manufacturing operations or the delivery of
    services as a result of (1) the failure or inability of
    suppliers to timely deliver quality parts; (2) volatility
    in the availability and cost of materials; (3) difficulties
    or delays in obtaining required export approvals;
    (4) information technology or infrastructure failures;
    (5) difficulties and costs related to planning or effecting
    business process changes and implementing a new ERP system;
    (6) natural disasters (such as earthquakes, floods or
    storms); or (7) other causes (such as regional economic
    downturns, pandemics, political instability, terrorism or acts
    of war), could result in delayed deliveries, manufacturing
    inefficiencies, increased costs or order cancellations.
    Moreover, if actual demand for Applied’s products is
    different than expected, Applied may purchase more/fewer parts
    than necessary or incur costs for canceling, postponing or
    expediting delivery of parts. Any or all of these factors could
    materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

The
    failure to successfully implement and conduct offshoring and
    outsourcing activities could adversely affect results of
    operations.

To better align costs with market conditions, increase its
    presence in growing markets, and enhance productivity and
    operational efficiency, Applied conducts engineering, software
    development and other operations in regions outside the United
    States, particularly India and China, and outsources certain
    functions to third parties, including companies in the United
    States, India, China and other countries. Outsourced functions
    include engineering, manufacturing, customer support, software
    development and administrative activities. The expanding role of
    third party providers has required changes to Applied’s
    existing operations and the adoption of new



procedures and processes for retaining and managing these
    providers in order to protect its intellectual property. If
    Applied does not effectively develop and implement its
    offshoring and outsourcing strategies, if required export and
    other governmental approvals are not timely obtained, or if
    Applied’s third party providers do not perform as
    anticipated, Applied may not realize productivity improvements
    or cost efficiencies and may experience operational
    difficulties, increased costs, manufacturing interruptions or
    delays, loss of its intellectual property rights, quality
    issues, increased product

time-to-market

and/or

inefficient allocation of human resources, any or all of which
    could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Applied
    is exposed to risks associated with acquisitions and strategic
    investments.

Applied has made, and in the future intends to make,
    acquisitions of, or investments in, companies, technologies or
    products in existing, related or new markets for Applied.
    Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including but not limited
    to: (1) diversion of management’s attention from other
    operational matters; (2) inability to complete acquisitions
    as anticipated or at all; (3) inability to realize
    anticipated benefits; (4) failure to commercialize
    purchased technologies; (5) inability to capitalize on
    characteristics of new markets that may be significantly
    different from Applied’s existing markets;
    (6) inability to obtain and protect intellectual property
    rights in key technologies; (7) ineffectiveness of an
    acquired company’s internal controls; (8) impairment
    of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological
    advancements or

worse-than-expected

performance of the acquired company or its product offerings;
    (9) unknown, underestimated

and/or

undisclosed commitments or liabilities; (10) excess or
    underutilized facilities; and (11) ineffective integration
    of operations, technologies, products or employees of the
    acquired companies. Applied also makes strategic investments in
    other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures,
    which may decline in value

and/or

not
    meet desired objectives. The success of these investments
    depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited
    or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures,
    requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic
    partners. Mergers and acquisitions and strategic investments are
    inherently subject to significant risks, and the inability to
    effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely
    affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results
    of operations.

The
    ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital
    to Applied’s success.

Applied’s success and competitiveness depend in large part
    on its ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees.
    Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors,
    including fluctuations in global economic and industry
    conditions, changes in Applied’s management or leadership,
    competitors’ hiring practices, and the effectiveness of
    Applied’s compensation programs, including its equity-based
    programs. Applied regularly evaluates its overall compensation
    program and makes adjustments, as appropriate, to enhance its
    competitiveness, such as instituting broad-based grants of
    restricted stock units in fiscal 2006. If Applied does not
    successfully attract, retain and motivate key employees,
    Applied’s ability to capitalize on its opportunities and
    its operating results may be materially and adversely affected.

Changes
    in tax rates or tax liabilities could affect
    results.

As a global company, Applied is subject to taxation in the
    United States and various other countries. Significant judgment
    is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.
    Applied’s future annual and quarterly tax rates could be
    affected by numerous factors, including changes in the
    (1) applicable tax laws; (2) composition of earnings
    in countries with differing tax rates; or (3) valuation of
    Applied’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition,
    Applied is subject to regular examination of its income tax
    returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax
    authorities. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of
    favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these
    examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for
    income taxes. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are
    reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final
    determination will not be materially different from the
    treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax
    provisions and accruals, which could materially and adversely
    affect Applied’s results of operations.



Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings or
    claims and protection of intellectual property
    rights.

Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be, involved
    in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement,
    intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental
    regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product
    liability, unfair competition, employment and other matters. In
    addition, Applied on occasion receives notification from
    customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or
    other obligations related to claims made against customers by
    third parties. These legal proceedings and claims, whether with
    or without merit, may be time-consuming and expensive to
    prosecute or defend and also divert management’s attention
    and resources. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome
    of current or future legal proceedings or claims. Applied
    previously entered into a mutual

covenant-not-to-sue

arrangement with one of its competitors to decrease the risk of
    patent infringement lawsuits in the future. There can be no
    assurance that the intended results of this arrangement will be
    achieved or that Applied will be able to adequately protect its
    intellectual property rights with the restrictions associated
    with such a covenant. In addition, Applied’s success
    depends in significant part on the protection of its
    intellectual property and other rights. Infringement of
    Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized
    manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in
    uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied.
    Applied’s intellectual property rights may not provide
    significant competitive advantages if they are circumvented,
    invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of
    technological change, or if Applied does not adequately assert
    these rights. Furthermore, the laws and practices of other
    countries, including China, Taiwan and Korea, permit the
    protection and enforcement of Applied’s rights to varying
    extents, which may not be sufficient to protect Applied’s
    rights. If Applied is not able to obtain or enforce intellectual
    property rights, resolve or settle claims, obtain necessary
    licenses on commercially reasonable terms,

and/or

successfully prosecute or defend its position, Applied’s
    business, financial condition and results of operations could be
    materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is subject to risks of non-compliance with environmental and
    safety regulations.

Applied is subject to environmental and safety regulations in
    connection with its global business operations, including but
    not limited to regulations related to the development,
    manufacture and use of its products; recycling and disposal of
    materials used in its products; the operation of its facilities;
    and the use of its real property. Failure or inability to comply
    with existing or future environmental and safety regulations
    could result in significant remediation liabilities, the
    imposition of fines

and/or

the
    suspension or termination of development, manufacture, sale or
    use of certain of its products,

and/or

may
    affect the operation of its facilities, use or value of its real
    property, each of which could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Applied
    is exposed to various risks related to the regulatory
    environment.

Applied is subject to various risks related to: (1) new,
    different, inconsistent or even conflicting laws, rules and
    regulations that may be enacted by legislative bodies

and/or

regulatory agencies in the countries in which Applied operates;
    (2) disagreements or disputes between national or regional
    regulatory agencies related to international trade; and
    (3) the interpretation and application of laws, rules and
    regulations. If Applied is found by a court or regulatory agency
    not to be in compliance with applicable laws, rules or
    regulations, Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

Applied
    is subject to internal control evaluations and attestation
    requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
    Act.

Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
    Applied must include in its annual report on

Form 10-K

a report of management on the effectiveness of Applied’s
    internal control over financial reporting and an attestation by
    Applied’s independent registered public accounting firm to
    the adequacy of management’s assessment of Applied’s
    internal control. Ongoing compliance with these requirements is
    complex, costly and time-consuming. If (1) Applied fails to
    maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;
    (2) Applied’s management does not timely assess the
    adequacy of such internal control; or (3) Applied’s
    independent registered



public accounting firm does not timely attest to the evaluation,
    Applied could be subject to regulatory sanctions and the
    public’s perception of Applied may decline.

(1)

Approximately 120,000 square feet were available for lease
    or sublease.

(2)

Includes approximately 260,000 square feet that were
    subleased.

In addition to the above properties, Applied leases office space
    for marketing, sales, engineering and customer support offices
    in 92 locations throughout the world: 25 in North America
    (principally the United States), 23 in Europe, 23 in Japan, 11
    in Asia-Pacific (including China and India), 7 in Korea and 3 in
    Taiwan.

In addition, Applied owns 94 acres of buildable land in
    Texas that could accommodate approximately 1,433,000 square
    feet of additional building space and 43 acres in
    California that could accommodate approximately
    1,247,000 square feet of additional building space. Applied
    also leases: 13 acres in Taiwan that could accommodate
    approximately 270,000 square feet of additional building
    space; 10 acres in Israel that could accommodate
    approximately 110,000 square feet of additional building
    space; and 25 acres in China, where Applied is building a
    118,000 square foot facility.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied’s Board of
    Directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of
    Applied’s real estate and facilities portfolio (the Plan).
    Properties were reported as assets

held-for-sale

and reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Applied recorded an asset



impairment charge to write down the following properties to
    estimated fair value: (1) facilities in Narita, Japan;
    Hillsboro, Oregon; Chunan, Korea; and Danvers, Massachusetts;
    and (2) 26 acres of unimproved land in Hillsboro,
    Oregon. As part of the Plan, Applied also recorded a charge for
    future obligations under a lease in Hayward, California, which
    was subsequently terminated. At October 29, 2006, Applied
    had properties held for sale in Hillsboro, Oregon; Narita,
    Japan; and Chunan, Korea. For additional discussion of the Plan,
    refer to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Applied considers these properties adequate to meet its current
    and future requirements. Applied regularly assesses the size,
    capability and location of its global infrastructure and
    periodically makes adjustments based on these assessments.

Item 3:

Legal
    Proceedings

David
    Scharf

On July 31, 2001, David Scharf, an individual, filed a
    lawsuit against Applied in the United States District Court for
    the Central District of California, captioned David
    Scharf v. Applied Materials, Inc. (case

no. 01-06580

AHM). The lawsuit alleges that Applied has infringed, has
    induced others to infringe, and has contributed to others’
    infringement of, a patent concerning color synthesizing scanning
    electron microscope technology. Mr. Scharf seeks a
    preliminary and permanent injunction, a finding of willful
    infringement, damages (including treble damages), and costs.
    Applied has answered the complaint and counterclaimed for
    declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. On
    May 10, 2002, Mr. Scharf filed a request for
    re-examination of his patent with the Patent and Trademark
    Office (PTO). On June 26, 2002, the case was removed from
    the Court’s active docket after the parties stipulated to
    stay the case pending the results of that re-examination. On
    July 11, 2002, Applied filed its own request for
    re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with the PTO.
    Applied’s request for re-examination was granted on
    September 19, 2002. On April 23, 2004, the PTO
    notified Applied that it intended to issue a re-examination
    certificate. On June 14, 2004, Applied filed a second
    request for re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with
    the PTO. The second request was denied on September 1,
    2004. On October 1, 2004, Applied filed a petition for
    reconsideration of that denial, which subsequently was denied.
    The lawsuit was returned to the active docket of the District
    Court for the Central District of California in January 2006,
    and is scheduled to commence trial on April 3, 2007. The
    parties are engaged in discovery and on November 6, 2006,
    the Court heard opposing motions for summary judgment on the
    issues of infringement and claim construction. The Court has not
    yet ruled on these motions. Applied believes it has meritorious
    defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue them vigorously.

Linear
    Technology

On March 12, 2002, Linear Technology Corp. (LTC) filed a
    complaint against Applied in the Superior Court for the County
    of Santa Clara, captioned Linear Technology Corp. v.
    Applied Materials, Inc., Novellus Systems, Inc. and Tokyo
    Electron Ltd. (case no. CV806004), alleging claims for
    breach of contract, fraud and deceit, negligent
    misrepresentation, suppression of fact, unfair competition,
    breach of warranty, express contractual indemnity, implied
    equitable indemnity and declaratory relief. The complaint
    alleged, among other things, that Applied is obligated to
    indemnify and defend LTC for certain claims in an underlying
    patent infringement lawsuit brought by Texas Instruments, Inc.
    (TI) against LTC. On November 12, 2002, LTC filed an
    amended complaint asserting essentially the same claims as in
    the original complaint, but adding an additional assertion that
    LTC and TI have settled their litigation. Applied’s motion
    to dismiss the amended complaint was granted in part. LTC filed
    Second and Third Amended Complaints, each of which was dismissed
    upon Applied’s motion. On February 13, 2004, LTC filed
    a Fourth Amended Complaint, which Applied moved to dismiss. LTC
    then filed a motion to amend its Fourth Amended Complaint, which
    the Court granted. On July 7, 2004, LTC filed a Fifth
    Amended Complaint. On October 5, 2004, Applied’s
    motion to dismiss LTC’s Fifth Amended Complaint was granted
    with prejudice. On January 11, 2005, LTC filed a notice of
    appeal of the dismissal of its complaint. Applied believes it
    has meritorious defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.



Jusung

On December 24, 2003, Applied filed a lawsuit against
    Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. (Jusung Engineering) and Jusung
    Pacific Co., Ltd. (Jusung Pacific, referred to together with
    Jusung Engineering as Jusung) in Tao-Yuan District Court in
    Taiwan, captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung
    Engineering Co., Ltd. (case no. 92 Tsai-chuan Tzi
    No. 6388). The lawsuit alleges that Jusung is infringing a
    patent related to chemical vapor deposition owned by Applied. In
    the lawsuit, Applied seeks a provisional injunction prohibiting
    Jusung from importing, using, manufacturing, servicing or
    selling in Taiwan certain flat panel display manufacturing
    equipment. On December 25, 2003, the Tao-Yuan District
    Court ruled in favor of Applied’s request for a provisional
    injunction and, on January 14, 2004, the Court issued a
    provisional injunction order against Jusung Pacific. Jusung
    Pacific appealed those decisions, and the decisions were
    affirmed on appeal. On January 30, 2004, Jusung Pacific
    requested permission to post a counterbond to have the Jusung
    Pacific injunction lifted. Jusung Pacific’s counterbond
    request was granted and, on March 30, 2004, the provisional
    injunction order was lifted. At Applied’s request, on
    December 11, 2004, the District Court issued a provisional
    injunction order against Jusung Engineering. Jusung Engineering
    appealed that order, and the order was affirmed on appeal.
    Jusung Engineering also requested permission to post a
    counterbond to have the Jusung Engineering injunction lifted.
    Jusung Engineering’s counterbond request was granted and on
    April 25, 2005, the provisional injunction order against
    Jusung Engineering was lifted. Applied has appealed both
    counterbond decisions. On June 30, 2004, Applied filed a
    “main action” patent infringement complaint against
    Jusung in the Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan, captioned
    Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd.
    (case no. 93 Zhong Zhi No. 3). In the lawsuit, Applied
    seeks damages and a permanent injunction for infringement of the
    same patent. The decisions regarding the provisional injunction
    and counterbond have no effect on the separate patent
    infringement lawsuit filed by Applied against Jusung in the
    Hsinchu Court. In August 2006, the Court set the litigation fee
    and the litigation security payment, and the main action is now
    proceeding on its merits. The Court held a second hearing in the
    main action on October 30, 2006. This same patent is the
    subject of an invalidity proceeding filed in the Taiwanese
    Patent and Trademark Office by Jusung Pacific in June 2004.
    Applied believes it has meritorious claims and intends to pursue
    them vigorously.

On June 13, 2006, Applied filed an action in the Taiwanese
    Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of a patent
    owned by Jusung Engineering (Taiwanese Patent
    No. 249186) related to the severability of the
    transfer chamber. On June 20, 2006, Jusung Engineering
    filed a lawsuit against Applied and Applied’s subsidiary,
    AKT, in Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan, captioned Jusung
    Engineering, Co. Ltd. v. AKT America, Inc. and Applied
    Materials, Inc., alleging infringement of this patent. Jusung
    Engineering’s lawsuit seeks damages, costs and
    attorneys’ fees, but does not seek injunctive relief. The
    Court has scheduled the first hearing in this matter for
    December 28, 2006. Applied believes that it has meritorious
    defenses that it intends to pursue vigorously.

Taiwan
    Fair Trade Commission

On April 10, 2004, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC)
    notified Applied’s subsidiary, AKT, in Taiwan that,
    pursuant to a complaint filed by Jusung, the TFTC had begun an
    investigation into whether AKT had violated the Taiwan Fair
    Trade Act. The investigation focused on whether AKT violated the
    Taiwan Guidelines for the Review of Cases Involving Enterprises
    Issuing Warning Letters for Infringement on Copyright, Trademark
    and Patent Rights by allegedly notifying customers about
    AKT’s patent rights and the infringement of those rights by
    Jusung. On June 15, 2004, the TFTC notified Applied that
    Applied also was the subject of the investigation. By letter
    dated April 15, 2005, the TFTC notified Applied and AKT
    that there was insufficient evidence to support a claim against
    either company. Jusung appealed the TFTC’s decision, and
    the appeals court affirmed the decision of the TFTC in favor of
    Applied on February 7, 2006. Jusung has appealed the
    appeals court’s affirmation of the decision of the TFTC.

Silicon
    Services Consortium

On January 19, 2006, five companies that sell refurbished
    Applied tools (Silicon Services Consortium Inc., Semiconductor
    Support Services Co., OEM Surplus, Inc., Precision Technician
    Inc., and Semiconductor Equipment Specialist, Inc.) filed a
    lawsuit against Applied in the United States District Court for
    the Western District of Texas, captioned Silicon Services
    Consortium, Inc., et al. v. Applied Materials, Inc.
    (case no. A06CA051 LY). The plaintiffs claim that a policy
    that Applied announced in January 2005 limiting the sale of
    certain parts to them



constituted an unlawful attempt to monopolize the refurbishment
    business, an interference with existing contracts, and an
    interference with prospective business relationships. The suit
    seeks injunctive relief, damages, costs and attorneys’
    fees. After Applied filed a motion to dismiss the original
    complaint, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging
    similar conduct. Applied filed a motion to dismiss the amended
    complaint on April 7, 2006, and a hearing before the Court
    was conducted on August 22, 2006. The Court has not yet
    ruled on these motions. Applied believes it has meritorious
    defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue them vigorously.

Applied does not believe that the outcome of any of the above
    matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial
    position or results of operations.

Other
    Legal Matters

From time to time, Applied receives notification from third
    parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking
    indemnification, litigation support, payment of money or other
    actions by Applied in connection with claims made against them
    by third parties. In addition, from time to time, Applied
    receives notification from third parties claiming that Applied
    may be or is infringing their intellectual property or other
    rights. Applied also is subject to various other legal
    proceedings and claims, both asserted and unasserted, that arise
    in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of
    these claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
    Applied does not believe that any of these other existing
    proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on its
    consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Item 7:

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

Introduction

Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is intended
    to facilitate an understanding of Applied’s business and
    results of operations. This MD&A should be read in
    conjunction with Applied’s Consolidated Financial
    Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements included elsewhere in this report. The following
    discussion contains forward — looking statements and
    should also be read in conjunction with the cautionary statement
    set forth at the beginning of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

MD&A consists of the following sections:

•

Overview:

a summary of Applied’s
    business, measurements and opportunities.

•

Results of Operations:

a discussion of
    operating results.

•

Segment Information:

a discussion of segment
    operating results.

•

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital
    Resources:

an analysis of cash flows, sources and
    uses of cash, contractual obligations and financial position.

•

Critical Accounting Policies:

a discussion of
    critical accounting policies that require the exercise of
    judgments and estimates.

Overview

Applied develops, manufactures, markets and services
    semiconductor and semiconductor-related fabrication equipment,
    providing nanomanufacturing
    technology

tm

solutions to the global semiconductor, flat panel display, solar
    and other industries. Product development and manufacturing
    activities occur in North America, Europe and Israel.
    Applied’s broad range of equipment and service products are
    highly technical and are sold through a direct sales force.
    Customer demand for spare parts and services is fulfilled
    through a global spare parts distribution system and trained
    service engineers located around the world in close proximity to
    customer sites.

As a supplier to these industries, Applied’s results are
    primarily driven by worldwide demand for chips and flat panel
    displays, which in turn depends on end-user demand for
    electronic products. The industries in which Applied operates
    are volatile and its results in fiscal 2004 through 2006 reflect
    this volatility.

The following table presents certain significant measurements of
    the past three fiscal years:

Operating results for fiscal 2004 reflected a recovery from a
    downturn in the semiconductor industry and the global economy,
    as well as realized savings from Applied’s fiscal 2003
    realignment activities. In addition, Applied gained market share
    in critical areas, including 300mm equipment and copper
    interconnect, and improved its operational efficiencies.

Fiscal 2005 results reflected a challenging environment as
    Applied’s customers decreased fab utilization globally and
    reduced or delayed capital expenditures as a result of excess
    inventories and slowing demand for chips. In this period,
    Applied focused on lowering costs, improving efficiencies,
    reducing cycle time and bringing new products to market. During
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, customer demand for Applied
    products began to increase.



Customer demand further improved in fiscal 2006, resulting in
    higher orders and revenue. Fiscal 2006 results reflected a
    recovery in the semiconductor and semiconductor-related
    industries and the global economy as end-user demand for
    electronic products and flat panel displays drove increased
    customer requirements for advanced silicon and display products.
    During this period, Applied’s semiconductor customers
    increased both high-volume production and leading-edge 65nm
    and 45nm chip development. Results for this period also
    reflected Applied’s continued focus on cost controls.
    Improvements in operating performance were offset in part by
    restructuring and asset impairment charges associated with real
    estate and facilities disinvestment that commenced during the
    first fiscal quarter, equity-based compensation expenses and an
    in-process research and development expense associated with the
    acquisition of Applied Films Corporation (Applied Films).

During the second half of fiscal 2006, Applied completed certain
    transactions in support of its long-term growth strategy.
    Management believes that these transactions will enhance
    Applied’s ability to extend its nanomanufacturing
    capabilities into adjacent and new markets, including color
    filters for flat panel displays, solar cells, flexible
    electronics, energy-efficient glass and track solutions for
    semiconductor manufacturing. These transactions included the
    acquisition of Applied Films, the formation of a joint venture
    with Dainippon Screen Mfg. Co., Ltd. (Screen), and the purchase
    of certain parts cleaning and recycling assets in Singapore from
    UMS Solutions Pte. Ltd. (UMS Solutions), a wholly-owned
    subsidiary of Norelco UMS Holdings Limited.

Applied’s long-term opportunities depend in part on
    successful execution of its growth strategy, including
    increasing market share in existing markets, expanding into
    related markets, and cultivating new markets and new business
    models. These opportunities are also subject to many factors,
    including: (1) global economic conditions;
    (2) advanced technology

and/or

capacity requirements of semiconductor manufacturers and their
    capital investment trends; (3) the profitability of chip
    and display manufacturers; (4) supply and demand for chips,
    flat panel displays, solar panels, and related products and
    services; (5) realization of the anticipated benefits of
    business combinations; (6) continued investment in
    research, development and engineering (RD&E); and
    (7) the relative competitiveness of Applied’s
    equipment and service products. For these and other reasons set
    forth in Part 1, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,”
    Applied’s prior results of operations are not necessarily
    indicative of future operating results.

Results
    of Operations

Net
    Sales

Applied’s business was subject to cyclical industry
    conditions in fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006. As a result of these
    conditions, there were significant fluctuations in
    Applied’s quarterly new orders and net sales, both within
    and across the fiscal years. Demand for manufacturing equipment
    has historically been volatile as a result of sudden changes in
    chip and flat panel supply and demand and other factors,
    including rapid technological advances in fabrication processes.

New orders increased to $9.0 billion for fiscal 2004,
    reflecting a broad-based increase in capital investment in 300mm
    technology to meet rising demand for chips and flat panel
    displays. Following the new order trends, net sales increased to
    $8.0 billion in fiscal 2004, reflecting the fulfillment of
    higher levels of orders for capital equipment received in prior
    quarters to support customers’ manufacturing capacity
    expansion and new technology requirements.

New orders for fiscal 2005 decreased 29 percent, from
    $9.0 billion in the prior year to $6.4 billion, as
    semiconductor manufacturers reduced their capital investments to
    align inventories with demand. Following the trend of decreasing
    orders during fiscal 2005, net sales decreased by
    13 percent from $8.0 billion for fiscal 2004 to
    $7.0 billion for fiscal 2005, reflecting lower demand for
    semiconductor products.



New orders for fiscal 2006 increased 55 percent, from
    $6.4 billion in the prior year to $9.9 billion, as
    customer demand increased. Following the trend of increasing
    orders during fiscal 2006, net sales increased by
    31 percent, from $7.0 billion for fiscal 2005 to
    $9.2 billion for fiscal 2006.

Gross
    Margin

Gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from
    46.2 percent for fiscal 2004 to 44.1 percent for
    fiscal 2005, and increased to 46.8 percent for fiscal 2006.
    The higher gross margin percentage for fiscal 2004 was
    principally attributable to improved revenue levels, changes in
    product mix, decreased product costs, and increased
    manufacturing volume, resulting in higher absorption of
    manufacturing and field service costs and the completion of
    refocused product efforts. The higher gross margin in fiscal
    2004 was partially offset by increased variable compensation
    costs as a result of improved operating performance. The
    decrease in gross margin from fiscal 2004 to fiscal 2005 was due
    to lower revenue levels, lower manufacturing absorption and
    changes in product mix, which were partially offset by
    initiatives for cost reduction and efficiency improvement, such
    as common platform architecture and parts, lower cost sourcing
    and cycle time reduction. The increase in the gross margin
    percentage from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006 was principally
    attributable to the combination of higher revenue levels,
    decreased product costs and increased manufacturing volume and
    absorption, partially offset by increased variable and
    equity-based compensation costs. Applied began recognizing
    expenses associated with stock options and the ESPP in fiscal
    2006. Gross margin during fiscal 2006 included $37 million
    of equity-based compensation expense.

Research,
    Development and Engineering

Applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable
    extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the
    products and services it provides. Applied believes that it is
    critical to continue to make substantial investments in RD&E
    to assure the availability of innovative technology that meets
    the current and projected requirements of its customers’
    most advanced designs. Applied has historically maintained its
    commitment to investing in RD&E in order to continue to
    offer new products and technologies. As a result, RD&E
    expenses were $992 million (12 percent of net sales)
    for fiscal 2004, $941 million (13 percent of net
    sales) for fiscal 2005, and $1.2 billion (13 percent
    of net sales) for fiscal 2006. Equity-based compensation
    expenses during fiscal 2006 associated with research,
    development and engineering functions totaled $76 million.
    Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on
    whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product or
    a new product. Most of Applied’s existing products resulted
    from internal development activities and innovations involving
    new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances,
    Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product
    areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to
    reduce time to market.

In fiscal 2004, Applied continued its investment in developing
    technologies for future generation manufacturing. Advances were
    made in several key areas, including technology for enhancing
    transistor and interconnect performance.

In fiscal 2005, Applied focused on developing systems for
    customers’ advanced chip designs, including systems to
    enable smaller and faster interconnect and transistor structures
    with 65nm, 45nm and below geometries and flat panel display
    systems to process larger glass substrates.

In fiscal 2006, Applied continued its development of systems to
    increase chip performance, especially for Flash and DRAM
    devices. Applied also focused on developing systems for 32nm and
    22nm copper/low k interconnect processing technologies to
    address critical manufacturing challenges that chipmakers face
    as they transition to future device generations, helping them to
    bring new products to market more rapidly while minimizing risk.
    Applied also continued to focus on developing flat panel display
    systems to process even larger glass substrates.

During fiscal 2006, Applied recorded an in-process research and
    development (IPR&D) expense in the amount of
    $14 million related to the acquisition of Applied Films.
    Applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price
    relating to purchased acquisitions to IPR&D was determined
    through established valuation techniques. The IPR&D was
    expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had
    not been established and no future alternative uses existed. No
    IPR&D charges were recorded in fiscal 2005. During fiscal
    2004, Applied recorded an IPR&D expense in the amount of
    $6 million related to the acquisition of Torrex Equipment
    Corporation.



Marketing,
    Selling, General and Administrative

Marketing, selling, general and administrative expenses were
    $752 million (9 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2004,
    decreased to $697 million (10 percent of net sales)
    for fiscal 2005, and increased to $907 million
    (10 percent of net sales) for fiscal 2006. The decrease in
    operating expenses from fiscal 2004 to 2005 was due to lower
    business volume. Operating expenses were affected by reductions
    in variable compensation due to lower operating performance and
    focus on cost controls. The increase from fiscal 2005 to 2006
    correlated to the increase in business volume, as well as
    increases in variable compensation as a result of improved
    operating performance, equity-based compensation expense, and
    spending on the Company’s business transformation
    initiative, partially offset by savings resulting from
    Applied’s continued focus on controlling its overall cost
    structure. Equity-based compensation expenses during fiscal 2006
    associated with marketing, sales and general and administrative
    functions totaled $104 million. During fiscal 2006, Applied
    launched the planning stage of its multi-year business
    transformation initiative, which is expected to include the
    design of certain new company-wide business processes and the
    transition to a single-vendor software system to perform various
    functions, such as order management and manufacturing control.

Restructuring
    and Asset Impairments

Restructuring actions taken in fiscal 2004 were intended to
    better align Applied’s cost structure with prevailing
    market conditions due to the industry downturn at the time.
    These actions, which were necessary as a result of reduced
    business volume, reduced Applied’s global workforce and
    consolidated global facilities. Restructuring, asset impairments
    and other charges for fiscal 2004 totaled $167 million,
    consisting of $65 million for facility consolidations,
    $6 million for severance and benefits, and $96 million
    for other costs, primarily fixed asset writeoffs due to facility
    consolidations.

As of October 29, 2006, the fiscal 2004 restructuring
    actions were completed, and restructuring reserve balances
    consisted principally of remaining lease commitments associated
    with facilities.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied’s Board of
    Directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of
    Applied’s real estate and facilities portfolio (the Plan).
    Properties with an estimated fair value of $56 million were
    reported as assets

held-for-sale

and reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Applied recorded an asset impairment
    charge of $124 million during the first quarter of fiscal
    2006 to write down the following properties to estimated fair
    value: (1) facilities in Narita, Japan; Chunan, Korea;
    Hillsboro, Oregon; Danvers, Massachusetts; and
    (2) 26 acres of unimproved land in Hillsboro, Oregon.
    As part of the Plan, Applied also recorded a charge in the
    amount of $91 million for future lease obligations that
    were scheduled to continue through fiscal 2014 related to the
    closure of its leased Hayward, California facility. During the
    third quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied sold the Danvers,
    Massachusetts facility for net proceeds of $16 million and
    recognized a gain of $4 million. During the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2006, Applied recorded additional impairment charges
    on the Narita and Chunan facilities of $6 million and
    recorded a restructuring charge of $4 million related to
    environmental contamination of the Narita site. During the
    second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2006, Applied
    consumed $9 million in restructuring reserves related to
    the Hayward campus in rental and operating costs. In the fourth
    quarter of fiscal 2006, the Hayward lease obligation was
    terminated for $81 million. Applied continues to actively
    market the remaining properties.

For further details, see Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Litigation
    Settlements, Net

Litigation settlements, net were $27 million for fiscal
    2004 and consisted of costs of $28 million related to two
    separate patent litigation settlements, net of a gain of
    $1 million related to a legal settlement in favor of
    Applied. During fiscal 2005 and 2006, there were no material
    litigation settlements.

Net
    Interest Income

Net interest income was $66 million for fiscal 2004,
    $134 million for fiscal 2005 and $149 million for
    fiscal 2006. The increases in net interest income from fiscal
    2004 to 2005 and from 2005 to 2006 were due primarily to a



substantial increase in interest rates combined with a decrease
    in interest expense associated with scheduled debt maturities in
    September 2004 and September 2005.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied repurchased
    145 million shares of outstanding common stock for an
    aggregate purchase price of $2.5 billion under an
    accelerated buyback program. The repurchase was funded with
    Applied’s existing cash and investments. A portion of the
    investment portfolio was sold to fund the accelerated stock
    buyback, resulting in lower interest income due to the
    realization of losses associated with certain investments and a
    reduced investment portfolio.

Income
    Taxes

Applied’s effective income tax provision rate was
    26.1 percent for fiscal 2004, 23.5 percent for fiscal
    2005 and 30.0 percent for fiscal 2006. Applied’s
    effective rate of 23.5 percent for fiscal 2005 reflected
    the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income
    tax filings of $118 million and a change in estimate with
    respect to export tax benefits of $14 million, partially
    offset by a charge of $32 million relating to the
    distribution of foreign earnings under the American Jobs
    Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act). Applied’s
    effective tax rate of 30.0 percent for fiscal 2006
    reflected benefits of $61 million principally related to
    the favorable resolution of audits of prior years’ income
    tax filings, partially offset by a $17 million charge from
    the expensing of equity-based compensation.

The Jobs Creation Act, enacted in fiscal 2004, provides for a
    three year phase-out of current extraterritorial income tax
    (ETI) benefits and replaces ETI with a phased-in nine percent
    domestic production activity deduction that will not be fully
    effective until 2010. The Jobs Creation Act will not fully
    replace Applied’s current ETI tax benefits.

Applied’s future effective income tax rate depends on
    various factors, such as tax legislation, the geographic
    composition of Applied’s pre-tax income, and non-tax
    deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions.
    Management carefully monitors these factors and timely adjusts
    the effective income tax rate accordingly.

Segment
    Information

After the acquisition of Applied Films, Applied made certain
    changes to its internal financial reporting structure during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and, as a result, is reporting
    four segments: Silicon, Fab Solutions, Display, and Adjacent
    Technologies. A description of the products and services, as
    well as financial data, for each reportable segment can be found
    in Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
    Future changes to Applied’s internal financial reporting
    structure may result in changes to the reportable segments
    disclosed. Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments
    certain operating expenses which are reported separately at the
    corporate level. These unallocated costs include equity-based
    compensation, regional marketing and sales, corporate functions
    (certain management, finance, legal, human resources and
    RD&E costs) and unabsorbed information technology and
    occupancy costs. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006,
    Applied operated in one reportable segment. Fiscal 2004 and 2005
    amounts are presented on a basis comparable to fiscal 2006
    amounts. Discussions below include the results of each
    reportable segment.

Fiscal 2004 Silicon orders of $6.4 billion reflected
    investment in advanced 300mm manufacturing capacity by chip
    manufacturers due to robust consumer spending, increased
    corporate information technology spending and growth in the
    personal computer and cell phone markets. During fiscal 2004,
    net sales of $5.8 billion reflected increased demand for
    Applied’s low k CVD Black products, and PECVD, CMP and PVD
    products continued to be industry benchmarks for performance and
    capability in advanced technologies. During fiscal 2004,
    operating income of $1.8 billion reflected higher net sales
    and cost savings related to completion of the realignment plan,



offset in part by higher variable compensation expenses. In
    fiscal 2004, RD&E advances were made in several key areas,
    including technology for enhancing transistor and interconnect
    performance. Ten major products were introduced, including the
    Applied Endura2, Applied Reflexion LK Ecmp, Applied Producer
    HARP, Applied Quantum X and Applied SEMVision G2 FIB systems,
    all targeted for 65nm and below chip manufacturing.

Silicon orders of $3.9 billion decreased 38 percent in
    fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Net sales of
    $4.5 billion decreased 23 percent in fiscal 2005
    compared to fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 was a year of lower
    semiconductor capital equipment investment, as customers aligned
    inventories with demand. During fiscal 2005, customers decreased
    manufacturing utilization to address rising chip inventory and
    softening end-user demand. Operating income of $1.1 billion
    decreased 40 percent in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal
    2004. During fiscal 2005, Applied reduced variable expenses and
    the cost of products sold in order to align its cost structure
    with market conditions. In fiscal 2005, RD&E focused on
    developing systems for customers’ advanced chip designs,
    including systems to enable smaller and faster interconnect and
    transistor structures with 65nm, 45nm and below geometries. For
    copper interconnect applications, the Company introduced the
    Applied Endura CuB/S II system with advanced copper
    barrier/seed technology and the Applied Producer Black
    Diamond II system for next-generation low k dielectric film
    layers. For leading-edge transistor gate applications, the
    Company launched the Applied Centura AdvantEdge Etch system,
    Applied
    Siconi

tm

preclean technology and the Applied Vantage RadOx RTP. New
    applications in strain engineering, which involves creating
    localized areas of stress in the transistor structure, were also
    developed for existing systems to meet customers’
    requirements for faster transistors. In the area of inspection
    and metrology, the Company launched the Applied
    UVision

tm

system, the industry’s first laser 3D brightfield
    inspection tool, and Applied OPC Check software, designed to
    automate critical OPC mask verification.

Silicon orders of $6.6 billion increased 67 percent in
    2006 compared to 2005. During fiscal 2006, leading semiconductor
    manufacturers reported increased sales as the electronics market
    continued to grow. The demand for consumer electronics,
    including broadband, personal computers and cell phones with
    increasing digital content and complex chips, resulted in
    increased chip demand and the need for new capacity. In addition
    to expanding consumer electronics demand, corporate information
    technology investment increased, with an emphasis on security,
    server consolidation and more robust internet infrastructures.
    Net sales of $6.0 billion increased 34 percent in 2006
    compared to 2005. During fiscal 2006, demand increased in many
    areas, including etch, inspection and thin films products.
    Operating income of $2.0 billion increased 81 percent
    in 2006 compared to 2005. Improved operating results in fiscal
    2006 reflected an increase in business volume, offset in part by
    increases in variable compensation expenses. In fiscal 2006,
    Applied continued its development of systems to increase chip
    performance, especially for Flash and DRAM devices. To extend
    aluminum (the material used by many memory manufacturers for
    interconnects) to the

sub-70nm

node, the Company introduced two products, the Applied Endura
    CVD Al technology and Applied Centura AdvantEdge Metal Etch
    system. For faster copper interconnects, Applied launched its
    enhanced Endura CuBS system with Aktiv Preclean, extending the
    system’s capability to the 45nm node and below, especially
    for use with ultra-low k dielectric films. The Company
    introduced the Applied Endura iLB II (integrated
    liner-barrier) system, offering advances in PVD titanium and
    preclean technologies, to provide significantly reduced
    resistance for contact structures. The Company also focused on
    providing solutions to extend customers’ lithography
    technology, introducing the Applied Producer APF-e (advanced
    patterning film enhancement) system. The new APF-e film enables
    chipmakers to cost-effectively pattern nano-scale features
    without additional integration complexity while reducing their
    reliance on next-generation lithography systems.

    base, and increased demand for remanufactured equipment. During
    fiscal 2004, operating income of $394 million reflected
    higher net sales and savings related to cost control initiatives.



Fiscal 2005 orders of $1.7 billion decreased 4 percent
    compared to fiscal 2004, reflecting customers’ cost
    reduction initiatives and lower remanufactured systems orders,
    offset in part by a modest increase in wafer starts. Fiscal
    2005 net sales and operating income included Metron, which
    Applied acquired in December 2004, expanding the product and
    service portfolio with a wide range of outsourcing solutions.
    Net sales of $1.8 billion increased 6 percent in
    fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Operating income of
    $400 million increased 1 percent in fiscal 2005
    compared to fiscal 2004, and included Metron integration costs.

Fiscal 2004 orders, net sales and operating income reflected
    increased end-user demand for LCD TVs and laptop displays.
    Demand also increased for small panels, driven by mobile phones
    with enhanced capabilities, such as color displays, cameras,
    larger screen sizes and higher resolutions. Operating income
    included RD&E expenses related to the development of the
    Gen-7 system. Seventh generation TFT-LCD substrates measure 1.8m
    x 2.2m and produce up to six

46-inch

large screen displays.

Orders of $758 million decreased 10 percent in fiscal
    2005 compared to fiscal 2004. Fiscal 2005 orders reflected a
    lower demand for smaller panel equipment, offset in part by
    orders for Gen-7.5 systems as manufacturers migrated to
    larger-sized TFT-LCD display production. Net sales of
    $756 million increased 32 percent in fiscal 2005
    compared to fiscal 2004. Operating income of $254 million
    increased 43 percent in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal
    2004. Fiscal 2005 results included higher RD&E expenses.
    Applied introduced the Gen-8 AKT-50K PECVD system for
    manufacturing flat panel displays. This system processes 2.2m x
    2.4m glass substrates for producing up to six

52-inch

LCD
    screens.

Orders of $1.0 billion increased 37 percent in fiscal
    2006 compared to fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006, price
    reductions in consumer electronics accelerated the growth of the
    TFT-LCD display market. As a result, display manufacturers
    aggressively invested in Gen-7, Gen-7.5, and Gen-8 systems. In
    addition, laptop demand continued to be strong, resulting in
    additional Gen-5 and Gen-5.5 fab investment. With the
    acquisition of Applied Films in fiscal 2006, Applied entered the
    PVD color filter market. Net sales of $1.0 billion
    increased 28 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. During the
    last quarter of fiscal 2006, flat panel equipment demand began
    to slow as customers aligned their capacity plans and inventory
    levels. Operating income of $319 million increased
    25 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Fiscal 2006 results
    included a $5 million IPR&D expense related to the
    acquisition of Applied Films. Applied launched three FPD
    systems, the AKT-55K EBT, the AKT-55K PECVD and the AKT-NEW
    ARISTO 2200, for manufacturing Gen-8.5 panels, sized at 2.2m x

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued Statement No. 158, “Employer’s
    Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement
    Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and
    132R” (SFAS 158). SFAS 158 requires an entity to
    recognize in its statement of financial condition the funded
    status of its defined benefit post-retirement plans, measured as
    the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the
    benefit obligation. SFAS 158 also requires an entity to
    recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit
    post-retirement plan directly to accumulated other comprehensive
    income, net of tax, to the extent such changes are not
    recognized in earnings as components of periodic net benefit
    cost. SFAS 158 is effective for Applied in fiscal 2007.
    Applied does not expect the implementation of this standard to
    have a material effect on Applied’s financial position or
    results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value” (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157
    becomes effective for Applied in fiscal 2009. Applied is
    evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of
    SFAS 157 on its financial position and results of
    operations.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering
    the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”
    (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how the
    effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements
    should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement.
    SAB 108 is effective for Applied in fiscal 2007. Applied
    does not expect the implementation of this staff accounting
    bulletin to have a material effect on Applied’s financial
    position or results of operations.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48,
    “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties”
    (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing
    the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements
    as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the
    taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides
    guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of
    income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and
    penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning
    accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and
    increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded
    income tax uncertainties. FIN 48 will become effective for
    Applied beginning in fiscal 2008. Any differences between the
    amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior
    to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after
    adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment
    recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. Applied
    is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of
    FIN 48 on its financial position and results of operations.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
    Instruments — an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 133 and 140” (SFAS 155). SFAS 155 amends
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”, and No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities”. SFAS 155 also
    resolves issues addressed in SFAS 133 Implementation Issue
    No. D1, “Application of Statement 133 to
    Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets”.
    SFAS 155 (a) permits fair value remeasurement for any
    hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative
    that otherwise would require bifurcation, (b) clarifies
    which interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not
    subject to the requirements of SFAS 133,
    (c) establishes a requirement to evaluate interests in
    securitized financial assets to identify interests that are
    freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial
    instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring
    bifurcation, (d) clarifies that concentrations of credit
    risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives,
    and (e) amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the
    prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding
    a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial
    interest other than another derivative financial instrument.
    SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments
    acquired or issued after the beginning of Applied’s 2007
    fiscal year. Applied is currently assessing the



impact of SFAS 155, however, it does not anticipate that
    SFAS 155 will have a material impact on its financial
    position and results of operations.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections — a
    Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
    No. 3” (SFAS 154), which requires retrospective
    application to prior periods’ financial statements of
    voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is
    impracticable to do so. SFAS 154 is effective for
    accounting changes and corrections of errors beginning in fiscal
    2007. Applied does not expect the implementation of this
    standard to have a material effect on Applied’s financial
    position or results of operations.

Financial
    Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources

Applied’s cash, cash equivalents and investments decreased
    from $6.0 billion at October 30, 2005 to
    $3.2 billion at October 29, 2006 due primarily to
    share repurchases and cash dividend distributions. Applied has
    not undertaken any significant external financing activities for
    several years.

During fiscal 2006, Applied changed its accounting method for
    certain fixed-income investments, which resulted in the
    reclassification of these investments from short-term
    investments to long-term investments. As a result, prior period
    balances have been reclassified to conform to the current
    period’s presentation. This accounting method is based on
    the contractual maturity dates of fixed-income securities as
    current or long-term, while the prior classification was based
    on the nature of the securities and the availability for use in
    current operations. Applied believes this presentation method is
    preferable as it is more reflective of Applied’s assessment
    of the timing of when such securities will be converted to cash.
    Accordingly, certain fixed-income investments of
    $2.6 billion have been reclassified from short-term
    investments to long-term investments in the October 30,
    2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the fiscal 2006
    financial statement presentation. In connection with this
    reclassification, short-term deferred taxes have been
    reclassified to long-term deferred taxes. There have been no
    changes in Applied’s investment policies or practices
    associated with this change in accounting method. In addition,
    $50 million of long-term equity securities previously
    reported in other long-term assets have been reclassified to
    long-term investments in the October 30, 2005 Consolidated
    Balance Sheet to conform to the fiscal 2006 financial statement
    presentation. Applied continues to classify auction rate
    securities and variable rate demand notes as current assets,
    notwithstanding the underlying contractual term of such
    investments, since the highly liquid nature of these investments
    enables them to be readily convertible to cash.

Applied generated cash from operating activities of
    $1.6 billion for fiscal 2004, $1.2 billion for fiscal
    2005 and $1.9 billion for fiscal 2006. The primary sources
    of cash from operating activities have been net income, as
    adjusted to exclude the effect of non-cash charges including
    depreciation, amortization, equity-based compensation, asset
    impairments and restructuring and IPR&D expenses, and
    changes in working capital levels, including accounts receivable
    and inventories. Applied utilized programs to sell accounts
    receivable of $859 million for fiscal 2004,
    $158 million for fiscal 2005 and $245 million for
    fiscal 2006. The sales of these accounts receivable increased
    cash and reduced accounts receivable and days sales outstanding.
    Days sales outstanding were 69 days at the end of fiscal
    2004, compared to 85 days at the end of fiscal 2005 and
    80 days at the end of fiscal 2006. A portion of these sold
    accounts receivable is subject to certain limited recourse
    provisions. However, Applied has not experienced any losses
    under these programs. Availability and usage of these accounts
    receivable sale agreements depend on many factors, including the
    willingness of financial institutions to purchase receivables
    and the cost of such arrangements. The decrease in days sales
    outstanding in fiscal 2006 is primarily related to the change in
    the regional sales mix and



the resulting relative increase in the amount of sold accounts
    receivable. For further details regarding accounts receivable
    sales, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Inventories increased by $373 million in fiscal
    2006, which related to the increase in business volume and sales
    activity from fiscal 2005 to fiscal 2006.

Applied used $534 million of cash for investing activities
    for fiscal 2004, $179 million for fiscal 2005, and
    generated $2.0 billion during fiscal 2006. Applied’s
    investing activities included purchases of investments, net of
    sales and maturities, of $336 million for fiscal 2004.
    Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of
    purchases of investments, totaled $122 million for fiscal
    2005 and $2.6 billion for fiscal 2006. Proceeds from the
    sale of investments in fiscal 2006 were used principally to
    fund Applied’s accelerated stock buyback.

Capital expenditures were $191 million for fiscal 2004,
    $200 million for fiscal 2005, and $179 million for
    fiscal 2006, totaling $570 million for the past three
    years. The majority of capital spending was for application
    laboratories, equipment and related facilities. Fiscal 2004
    capital expenditures consisted principally of laboratory and
    demonstration equipment. Fiscal 2005 capital expenditures
    included investment in laboratory equipment and upgrades to
    Applied’s enterprise resource planning software and network
    architecture. Fiscal 2006 capital expenditures included
    purchases of lab equipment, network infrastructure and
    $18 million to purchase three buildings in
    Santa Clara, California that Applied had previously leased.

Investing activities also included investments in technology and
    acquisitions of companies to allow Applied to access new market
    opportunities or emerging technologies. During fiscal 2005,
    Applied paid $102 million, net of cash acquired, for the
    Metron and EcoSys acquisitions. During fiscal 2006, Applied paid
    cash for acquisitions and the investment in a joint venture
    totaling $486 million. During fiscal 2006, Applied acquired
    the outstanding stock of Applied Films for $310 million in
    cash, net of cash and marketable securities acquired and assumed
    equity awards with a fair value of $26 million, of which
    $18 million was included in the purchase price; formed a
    joint venture, Sokudo, with Dainippon Screen Mfg. Ltd. for which
    Applied paid $147 million in cash and contributed other
    assets; acquired certain assets of UMS Solutions for
    $10 million; and acquired ChemTrace for approximately
    $22 million in cash, net of cash acquired, of which
    $18 million was paid upon closing. See Note 13 of
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
    details.

Applied used cash of $359 million for financing activities
    for fiscal 2004, $1.6 billion for fiscal 2005 and
    $4.1 billion for 2006. Financing activities included
    issuances and repurchases of common stock and payment of
    dividends. Since March 1996, Applied has systematically
    repurchased shares of its common stock in the open market to
    partially fund its equity-based employee benefit and incentive
    plans. Cash used to repurchase shares totaled $650 million
    for fiscal 2004, $1.7 billion for fiscal 2005 and
    $4.2 billion for fiscal 2006. Beginning in the second
    fiscal quarter of 2005, Applied’s Board of Directors
    declared four consecutive quarterly cash dividends, in the
    amount of $0.03 per share each. The first two declared cash
    dividends totaling $98 million were paid during fiscal
    2005. Beginning in the second fiscal quarter of 2006,
    Applied’s Board declared three consecutive quarterly cash
    dividends, in the amount of $0.05 per share each. Cash
    dividends declared, totaling $251 million, were paid during
    fiscal 2006. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at
    the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on the
    Company’s financial condition, results of operations,
    capital requirements, business conditions and other factors.
    Financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of
    debt. Applied did not borrow any cash in fiscal years 2004, 2005
    or 2006. During fiscal 2006, Applied entered into a
    $100 million

364-day

unsecured credit agreement, which replaced a $250 million
    credit facility that expired during the year. Cash used for debt
    repayments totaled $105 million for fiscal 2004,
    $62 million for fiscal 2005 and $8 million for fiscal
    2006. Cash generated from issuances of common stock pursuant to
    Applied’s equity compensation programs totaled
    $397 million for fiscal 2004, $266 million for fiscal
    2005 and $361 million for fiscal 2006.

On September 18, 2006, Applied entered into accelerated
    stock buyback agreements with Goldman, Sachs & Co.
    (Goldman Sachs) under which Applied agreed to repurchase from
    Goldman Sachs shares of Applied’s outstanding common stock
    for an initial purchase price of $2.5 billion. Under the
    agreements, Applied purchased from Goldman Sachs
    145 million shares of Applied’s common stock on
    September 18, 2006 at a price per share of $17.20 and
    Goldman Sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of shares
    in the open market over the following four months. At the end of
    the four month period, Applied is entitled or subject to a price
    adjustment with Goldman Sachs based upon the volume weighted
    average price of Applied common stock during the purchase
    period. The price adjustment, if any, may be settled, at
    Applied’s option, in cash or shares of its common stock.
    The



repurchase was funded with Applied’s existing cash and
    investments. The repurchased shares were reported as treasury
    stock.

Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing
    and extent of factors such as those discussed above,
    Applied’s management believes that cash generated from
    operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing
    cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to
    satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next
    12 months. For further details regarding Applied’s
    operating, investing and financing activities for each of the
    three years in the period ended October 29, 2006, see the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in this report.

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

During the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby
    letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third
    parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by
    Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 29, 2006, the
    maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could
    be required to make under these guarantee agreements was
    approximately $114 million. Applied has not recorded any
    liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements beyond
    that required to appropriately account for the underlying
    transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on
    historical experience and information currently available, that
    it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid
    under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has operating leases for various facilities. Total
    rental expense for operating leases was $88 million for
    fiscal 2004, $87 million for fiscal 2005 and
    $70 million for fiscal 2006.

    purchase agreements as of October 29, 2006, the actual
    amounts to be paid by Applied may be less in the event that any
    agreements are renegotiated, cancelled or terminated.

Other
    Commitments

On July 20, 2006, Applied and Screen completed the
    formation of Sokudo, a Japanese joint venture company, to
    deliver advanced track solutions for customers’ critical
    semiconductor manufacturing requirements. Screen owns
    52 percent and holds the controlling interest in Sokudo,
    and Applied owns 48 percent. Screen transferred into Sokudo
    its existing track business and related intellectual property,
    including employees, products and its installed base of systems.
    Applied paid $147 million for its investment in Sokudo.
    Additionally, Applied contributed to Sokudo certain technology
    and related intellectual property and will provide key
    development employees. Screen performs manufacturing for Sokudo
    under an outsourcing agreement. Applied accounts for its
    interest in Sokudo under the equity method of accounting. Under
    this accounting method, Applied’s exposure to loss from
    ongoing



operations is limited to $144 million as of
    October 29, 2006, which represents Applied’s carrying
    value of its investment in Sokudo. Applied’s investment in
    Sokudo is classified as an equity-method investment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Critical
    Accounting Policies

The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related
    disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally
    accepted in the United States of America requires management to
    make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the
    amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements describes the significant accounting policies used in
    the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.
    Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered
    to be critical accounting policies.

A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both
    material to the presentation of Applied’s consolidated
    financial statements and requires management to make difficult,
    subjective or complex judgments that could have a material
    effect on Applied’s financial condition or results of
    operations. Specifically, these policies have the following
    attributes: (1) Applied is required to make assumptions
    about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the
    estimate; and (2) different estimates Applied could
    reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are
    reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on
    Applied’s financial condition or results of operations.

Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects
    cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates
    on historical experience and on various other assumptions
    believed to be applicable and reasonable under the
    circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur,
    as additional information is obtained and as Applied’s
    operating environment changes. These changes have historically
    been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial
    statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management
    is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which
    are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged
    periods of time. These uncertainties are discussed in the
    section above entitled “Risk Factors.” Based on a
    critical assessment of its accounting policies and the
    underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application
    of those policies, management believes that Applied’s
    consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in
    accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation
    of Applied’s financial condition and results of operations.

Management believes that the following are critical accounting
    policies:

Warranty
    Costs

Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue
    is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by
    analyzing specific product and historical configuration
    statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied’s
    warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure
    rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting
    product failures during the warranty period. As Applied’s
    customer engineers and process support engineers are highly
    trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a
    significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and
    availability of critical replacement parts is another
    significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen
    component failures or exceptional component performance can also
    result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs
    differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to
    the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could
    have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Inventory
    Valuation

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market,
    with cost determined on a

first-in,

first-out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for
    estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and
    the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future
    demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for
    potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing
    historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are
    evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known
    and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If
    actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated,
    additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete
    inventory might be required, which could have a material adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.



Goodwill
    and Intangible Assets

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment
    whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
    carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also
    reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually
    for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology,
    are generally recorded in connection with a business
    acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually
    based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the
    success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If
    actual product acceptance differs significantly from the
    estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment
    charge to write down the asset to its realizable value. The fair
    value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market
    multiples approach, and is dependent on market values for
    companies in a similar industry. A severe decline in market
    value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for
    impaired goodwill, which could have a material adverse effect on
    Applied’s business, financial condition and results of
    operations.

Income
    Taxes

Applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax
    assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect
    of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of
    recorded assets and liabilities, net operating losses and tax
    credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are also reduced by a
    valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion
    of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management has
    determined that it is more likely than not that its future
    taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax
    assets.

The effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic
    composition of worldwide earnings, tax regulations governing
    each region, non-tax deductible expenses incurred in connection
    with acquisitions and availability of tax credits. Management
    carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the
    effective income tax rate as required. If actual results differ
    from these estimates, Applied could be required to record a
    valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its
    effective income tax rate, which could have a material adverse
    effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and
    results of operations.

The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment
    in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of
    complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner
    inconsistent with Applied’s expectations could have a
    material impact on Applied’s results of operations and
    financial condition.

Equity-Based
    Compensation — Employee Stock Option Plans and
    Employee Stock Purchase Plans

Beginning on October 31, 2005, Applied began accounting for
    stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) shares
    under the provisions of SFAS 123(R), which requires
    recognition of the fair value of equity-based compensation. The
    fair value of stock options and ESPP shares was estimated using
    a Black-Scholes option valuation model. This methodology
    requires the use of subjective assumptions in implementing
    SFAS 123(R), including expected stock price volatility and
    the estimated life of each award. The fair value of equity-based
    compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized
    over the service period of the award, and Applied has elected to
    use the straight-line method. Applied makes quarterly
    assessments of the adequacy of the tax credit pool to determine
    if there are any deficiencies that require recognition in the
    consolidated condensed statements of operations. Prior to the
    implementation of SFAS 123(R), Applied accounted for stock
    options and ESPP shares under the provisions of APB 25 and
    made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by
    SFAS No. 148, “Accounting For Stock-Based
    Compensation — Transition and Disclosure —
    an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123,” which amended
    SFAS No. 123, “Accounting For Stock-Based
    Compensation.” Pro forma net income and pro forma net
    income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the Consolidated
    Financial Statements were estimated using a Black-Scholes option
    valuation model. The fair value of restricted stock units was
    calculated based upon the fair market value of Applied’s
    common stock at the date of grant (see Note 1 of Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements).

Legal
    Matters

Applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims,
    either asserted or unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course
    of business. Applied evaluates, among other factors, the degree
    of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably
    estimates the amount of the loss. Significant judgment is
    required in both the probability



determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably
    estimated. When Applied determines that it is probable that a
    loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable,
    the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements.
    Although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with
    certainty, Applied does not believe that any of the existing
    legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its
    financial condition or results of operations. However,
    significant changes in legal proceedings and claims, or the
    factors considered in the evaluation of those matters, could
    have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business,
    financial condition and results of operations.

Item 7A:

Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Interest
    Rate Risk

At October 29, 2006, Applied’s investment portfolio
    included fixed-income securities with a fair value of
    approximately $2.4 billion. Applied’s primary
    objective for investing in fixed-income securities is to
    preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk.
    These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will
    decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on
    Applied’s investment portfolio at October 29, 2006 and
    October 30, 2005, an immediate 100 basis point
    increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the
    fair value of the portfolio of approximately $28 million
    and $65 million, respectively. While an increase in
    interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment
    portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the
    Consolidated Statement of Operations unless the individual
    fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss
    is determined to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired.

Applied’s long-term debt bears interest at fixed rates. As
    such, Applied’s interest expense would increase only to the
    extent that Applied significantly increased the amount of
    variable rate obligations outstanding. Due to the short-term
    nature and relatively low amount of Applied’s variable rate
    obligations, an immediate 100 basis point increase in
    interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect
    on Applied’s near-term financial condition or results of
    operations.

Foreign
    Currency Exchange Rate Risk

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign
    currencies, such as Japanese yen, British pound, euro and
    Israeli shekel. Applied enters into forward exchange and
    currency option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all,
    existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated
    transactions expected to occur within 12 months. Gains and
    losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations at the time that the
    related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the
    effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward
    exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the
    related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these
    financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to
    risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency
    exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial
    instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Net foreign
    currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on
    Applied’s results of operations for fiscal 2004, 2005 or
    2006.

Forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency
    as the underlying transactions (primarily Japanese yen, British
    pound, euro and Israeli shekel), and the terms of the forward
    exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying
    transactions. Applied’s outstanding forward exchange
    contracts are

marked-to-market

(see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements),
    as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being
    hedged; therefore, the effect of exchange rate changes on
    forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially
    offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying
    transactions. The effect of an immediate 10 percent change
    in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the
    underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to
    Applied’s near-term financial condition or results of
    operations. Applied’s risk with respect to currency option
    contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to
    exercise the option. Premiums paid for options outstanding at
    October 29, 2006 were not material.

    Statements and Supplementary Data

The consolidated financial statements required by this Item are

Item 9:

Item 9A:

Controls
    and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures.

As
    of the end of the period covered by this report, management of
    Applied conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with
    the participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and
    operation of Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures,
    as such term is defined in

Rule 13a-15(e)

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based
    upon that evaluation, Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer concluded that Applied’s disclosure
    controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the
    period covered by this report in ensuring that information
    required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized and
    reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s
    rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that
    information required to be disclosed by Applied in such reports
    is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s
    management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
    Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
    regarding required disclosure.

Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting.

Applied’s
    management is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rule 13a-15(f)

of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the
    participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and
    Chief Financial Officer, management of Applied conducted an
    evaluation of the effectiveness of Applied’s internal
    control over financial reporting based upon the framework in
    “Internal Control — Integrated Framework”
    issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, Applied’s
    management concluded that Applied’s internal control over
    financial reporting was effective as of October 29, 2006.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has
    audited the consolidated financial statements included in this
    Annual Report on

Form 10-K

and, as part of the audit, has issued a report, included herein,
    on (1) Applied’s management’s assessment of the
    effectiveness of Applied’s internal control over financial
    reporting and (2) the effectiveness of Applied’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of October 29,
    2006.

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

During the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006, there were no changes in the internal control over
    financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably
    likely to materially affect, Applied’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

Inherent Limitations of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
    and Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting.

It should be noted that any system
    of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide
    only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives
    of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any
    control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about
    the likelihood of future events.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over
    Financial Reporting in Item 9A: Controls and Procedures,
    that Applied Materials, Inc. maintained effective internal
    control over financial reporting as of October 29, 2006,
    based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (COSO). Applied Materials, Inc.’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
    periods are subject to the risk that controls may become
    inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree
    of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that Applied
    Materials, Inc. maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of October 29, 2006, is fairly
    stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria
    established in

Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework

issued by COSO. Also, in our opinion, Applied
    Materials, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective
    internal control over financial reporting as of October 29,
    2006, based on the criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by COSO.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated balance sheets of Applied Materials, Inc. as of
    October 29, 2006 and October 30, 2005, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended October 29, 2006. In connection with our
    audits of the consolidated financial statements, we have also
    audited the financial statement schedule as of and for each of
    the years in the three-year period ended October 29, 2006.
    Our report dated December 14, 2006 expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule.

2000 Global Equity Incentive Plan

The 2000 Global Equity
    Incentive Plan (the 2000 Plan) was adopted effective as of
    June 21, 2000. The 2000 Plan provides for the grant of
    non-qualified stock options to employees other than officers and
    directors. The administrator of the 2000 Plan (either the Board
    or a committee appointed by the Board) determines the terms and
    conditions of all stock options granted; provided, however, that
    (1) the exercise price generally may not be less than
    100 percent of the fair market value (on the date of grant)
    of the stock covered by the option, and (2) the term of
    options can be no longer than 10 years (extended to up to
    13 years in the event of death). A total of
    147,000 shares has been authorized for issuance under the
    2000 Plan, and 19,198 shares remain available for issuance
    as of October 29, 2006.

Stock Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees

The Stock
    Purchase Plan for Offshore Employees (the Offshore ESPP) was
    adopted effective as of October 16, 1995. The Offshore ESPP
    provides for the grant of stock options to employees (other than
    United States citizens or residents) through one or more
    offerings. The administrator of the Offshore ESPP (the Board or
    a committee appointed by the Board) determines the terms and
    conditions of all options prior to the start of an offering,
    including the option exercise price, number of shares covered
    and when an option may be exercised. All options granted as part
    of an offering must be granted on the same date. A total of
    12,800 shares has been authorized for issuance under the
    Offshore Plan, and 3,775 shares remain available for

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

Note 1

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of
    Presentation

The consolidated financial
    statements include the accounts of Applied Materials, Inc. and
    its subsidiaries (Applied or the Company) after elimination of
    intercompany balances and transactions. All references to a
    fiscal year apply to Applied’s fiscal year which ends on
    the last Sunday in October. Fiscal 2005 and 2006 contained
    52 weeks, whereas fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks. The
    first fiscal quarter of 2005 and 2006 each contained
    13 weeks, whereas the first fiscal quarter of 2004
    contained 14 weeks.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America requires management to make estimates and assumptions
    that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial
    statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ
    materially from those estimates.

Reclassifications

The accompanying
    consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2004 and fiscal
    2005 contain certain reclassifications to conform to the fiscal
    2006 presentation. These consist of reclassification to
    long-term investments of $2.6 billion for fiscal 2005 of
    certain fixed-income securities, excluding auction rate
    securities and variable rate demand notes, previously reported
    in short-term investments in fiscal 2005 and related deferred
    taxes. The reclassifications resulted from a change in
    accounting for fixed-income investments based on contractual
    maturity dates. In connection with this reclassification,
    short-term deferred taxes were reclassified to long-term
    deferred taxes. In addition, certain long-term equity
    securities, previously reported in other long-term assets, are
    also now included in long-term investments. There were no
    changes in Applied’s investment policies or practices
    associated with this change in accounting method.

During fiscal 2006, Applied began disclosing treasury stock on
    the Consolidated Balance Sheets and in the Consolidated
    Statements of Changes in Stockholders Equity. Prior amounts have
    been restated to conform to the fiscal 2006 presentation.
    Repurchases of common stock are accounted for under the par
    value method. The cost of reissued shares was determined on a

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) basis.

Cash Equivalents and Investments

All
    highly-liquid investments with a remaining maturity of three
    months or less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash
    equivalents. All of Applied’s investments are classified as

available-for-sale

at the respective balance sheet dates. Investments classified as

available-for-sale

are recorded at fair value based upon quoted market prices, and
    any temporary difference between the cost and fair value of an
    investment is presented as a separate component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income/(loss). The specific identification
    method is used to determine the gains and losses on investments.

Inventories

Inventories are generally stated
    at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a FIFO
    basis.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant
    and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided over
    the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line
    method. Estimated useful lives for financial reporting purposes
    are as follows: buildings and improvements, 3 to 30 years;
    demonstration and manufacturing equipment, 3 to
    5 years; software, 3 to 5 years; and furniture,
    fixtures and other equipment, 3 to 15 years. Land
    improvements are amortized over the shorter of 15 years or
    the estimated useful life. Leasehold improvements are amortized
    over the shorter of five years or the lease term.

Intangible Assets

Goodwill and
    indefinite-lived assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for
    impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
    year. Purchased technology and other intangible assets are
    presented at cost, net of accumulated amortization, and are
    amortized over their estimated useful lives of
    2 to 15 years using the straight-line method.

Long-Lived Assets

Applied reviews long-lived
    assets for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets
    may not be recoverable. Applied assesses these assets for
    impairment based on estimated future cash flows from these
    assets.

Research, Development and Engineering
    Costs

Research, development and engineering costs
    are expensed as incurred.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are
    expensed as incurred. Advertising costs were not material for
    all periods presented.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense is based on
    pretax earnings. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are
    recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary
    differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets
    and liabilities, net operating losses and tax credit
    carryforwards.

Revenue Recognition

Applied recognizes revenue
    when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met:
    persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has
    occurred or services have been rendered; seller’s price to
    buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably
    assured. Applied’s shipping terms are customarily FOB
    Applied shipping point or equivalent terms. Applied’s
    revenue recognition policy generally results in revenue
    recognition at the following points: (1) for all
    transactions where legal title passes to the customer upon
    shipment, Applied recognizes revenue upon shipment for all
    products that have been demonstrated to meet product
    specifications prior to shipment; the portion of revenue
    associated with certain installation-related tasks is deferred
    based on the estimated fair value, and that revenue is
    recognized upon completion of the installation-related tasks;
    (2) for products that have not been demonstrated to meet
    product specifications prior to shipment, revenue is recognized
    at customer technical acceptance; (3) for transactions
    where legal title does not pass at shipment, revenue is
    recognized when legal title passes to the customer, which is
    typically at customer technical acceptance, and (4) for
    arrangements containing multiple elements, the revenue relating
    to the undelivered elements is deferred at estimated fair value
    until delivery of the deferred elements. In cases where Applied
    has sold products that have been demonstrated to meet product
    specifications prior to shipment, Applied believes that at the
    time of delivery, it has an enforceable claim to amounts
    recognized as revenue. Spare parts revenue is generally
    recognized upon shipment, and services revenue is generally
    recognized over the period that the services are provided.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Applied uses
    financial instruments, such as forward exchange and currency
    option contracts, to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing
    and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions
    expected to occur within 12 months. The terms of currency
    instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent
    with the timing of the transactions being hedged. The purpose of
    Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the
    effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency
    denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. All of
    Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at
    fair value based upon quoted market prices for comparable
    instruments. For derivative instruments designated and
    qualifying as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency
    denominated transactions, the effective portion of the gain or
    loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders’ equity,
    and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction
    affects earnings. If the transaction being hedged fails to
    occur, or if a portion of any derivative is ineffective, the
    gain or loss on the associated financial instrument is recorded
    promptly in earnings. For derivative instruments used to hedge
    existing foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities, the
    gain or loss on these hedges is recorded promptly in earnings to
    offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or
    liabilities being hedged. Applied does not use derivative
    financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Foreign Currency Translation

Applied’s
    subsidiaries, with the exception primarily of the subsidiary
    located in the United Kingdom, use the United States dollar as
    their functional currency. Accordingly, assets and liabilities
    of these subsidiaries are translated using exchange rates in
    effect at the end of the period, except for non-monetary assets,
    such as inventories and property, plant and equipment, that are
    translated using historical exchange rates. Revenues and costs
    are translated using average exchange rates for the period,
    except for costs related to those balance sheet items that are
    translated using historical exchange rates. The resulting
    translation gains and losses are included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Operations as incurred. Applied’s subsidiary
    located in the United Kingdom operates primarily using the
    British pound, and therefore, the British pound has been
    determined to be the functional currency for the United Kingdom
    subsidiary. Accordingly, all assets and liabilities of this



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

subsidiary are translated using exchange rates in effect at the
    end of the period, and revenues and costs are translated using
    average exchange rates for the period. The resulting translation
    adjustments are presented as a separate component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders’ equity.

Equity-Based
    Compensation

Applied has adopted equity-based compensation plans that provide
    for the grant to employees of equity-based awards, including
    stock options and, beginning in fiscal 2005, restricted stock
    units (referred to as performance shares under the Applied
    Materials, Inc. Employee Stock Incentive Plan). In addition,
    certain of these plans provide for the automatic grant of stock
    options to non-employee directors and permit the grant of
    equity-based awards to consultants. Applied also has two
    Employee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP) for United States and
    international employees, respectively, which enable
    substantially all employees to purchase Applied common stock.

On October 31, 2005, Applied implemented the provisions of
    Statement of Financial Accounting Standards

No. 123(R),

“Share-Based Payment” (SFAS 123(R)),
    using the modified prospective transition method.

SFAS 123(R) requires companies to recognize the cost of
    employee services received in exchange for awards of equity
    instruments based upon the grant-date fair value of those
    awards. Using the modified prospective transition method of
    adopting

SFAS 123(R),

Applied began recognizing compensation expense for stock
    options and ESPP shares granted after October 30, 2005,
    plus equity-based awards granted prior to, and unvested as of
    October 31, 2005. As provided under this method of
    implementation, prior periods have not been restated. The
    estimated fair value of Applied’s equity-based awards, less
    expected forfeitures, is amortized over the awards’ service
    period on a straight-line basis.

On November 10, 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards
    Board (FASB) issued FASB Staff position
    No. FAS 123(R)-3 “Transition Election Related to
    Accounting for Tax Effects of Share-Based Payment Awards.”
    Applied has elected to adopt the alternative transition method
    provided in the FASB Staff Position for calculating the tax
    effects of equity-based compensation pursuant to
    SFAS 123(R). The alternative transition method includes
    simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the
    additional paid-in capital pool (APIC pool) related to the tax
    effects of employee equity-based compensation, and to determine
    the subsequent impact on the APIC pool and Consolidated
    Statement of Cash Flows of the tax effects of employee
    equity-based compensation awards that are outstanding upon the
    implementation of SFAS 123(R).

The equity-based compensation expense for fiscal 2006 included
    $30 million related to restricted stock units. The expense
    related to restricted stock units would have been included in
    Applied’s Consolidated Statements of Operations under the
    provisions of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,
    “Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees”
    (APB 25) and is therefore excluded from the impact of
    the implementation of SFAS 123(R) for fiscal 2006. As a
    result of adopting SFAS 123(R), Applied’s income
    before taxes and net income for fiscal 2006 was reduced by
    $186 million and $146 million, respectively. The
    implementation of SFAS 123(R), which resulted in the
    expensing of stock options and the ESPP over the vesting or
    purchase period, as applicable, reduced basic and fully diluted
    earnings per share by $0.09 for fiscal 2006.

Total equity-based compensation expense recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations consists of charges
    associated with stock options, restricted stock units and the
    ESPP. Equity-based compensation expense and the related income
    tax benefit for fiscal 2006 were $216 million (or
    $0.11 per diluted share) which resulted in a
    $46 million income tax benefit.

Prior to October 31, 2005, Applied measured compensation
    expense for its employee equity-based compensation plans using
    the intrinsic value method under APB 25 and related
    interpretations. As the exercise price of all options granted
    under these plans was not below the fair market price of the
    underlying common stock on the grant date, no equity-based
    compensation cost for stock options was recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations under the intrinsic value
    method.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Stock
    Options

The exercise price of each stock option equals the market price
    of Applied’s stock on the date of grant. Most options are
    scheduled to vest over four years and expire no later than seven
    years after the grant date. The fair value of each option grant
    is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option
    pricing model. This model was developed for use in estimating
    the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting
    restrictions and are fully transferable. Applied’s employee
    stock options have characteristics significantly different from
    those of publicly traded options. The weighted average
    assumptions used in the model are outlined in the following
    table:

Fiscal 2006

Stock Options:

Dividend yield

0.73

%

Expected volatility

36.7

%

Risk-free interest rate

4.48

%

Expected life (in years)

3.8

The computation of the expected volatility assumption used in
    the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants is based on a
    combination of historical and implied volatilities. When
    establishing the expected life assumption, Applied annually
    reviews historical employee exercise behavior of option grants
    with similar vesting periods.

Options outstanding had an aggregate intrinsic value of
    $317 million and $165 million at October 30, 2005
    and October 29, 2006, respectively. The weighted average
    grant date fair value of options granted during fiscal 2006 was
    $54 million. The total intrinsic value of options exercised
    during fiscal 2006 was $57 million. The total fair value of
    options that vested during fiscal 2006 was $256 million. At
    October 29, 2006, Applied had $121 million of total
    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to stock option plans that will be recognized over the
    weighted average period of 1.1 years. Cash received from
    stock option exercises was $284 million during fiscal 2006.
    During fiscal 2006, as part of the acquisition of Applied Films
    Corporation (Applied Films), Applied assumed outstanding options
    to purchase Applied Films common stock that, at the acquisition
    date, had a fair value of $26 million, including
    $6 million of total unrecognized compensation expense, net
    of $2 million of estimated forfeitures (see Note 13).
    The total stock options assumed by Applied were converted into
    options to purchase 3 million shares of Applied common
    stock.

Employee
    Stock Purchase Plans

Under the ESPP, substantially all employees may purchase Applied
    common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to
    85 percent of the lower of the fair market value at the
    beginning of the offering period or at the end of each
    applicable purchase period. The number of shares issued under
    the ESPP during the year ended October 29, 2006 was
    4,065,000. Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the
    weighted average estimated fair value of purchase rights under
    the ESPP was $5.21 for the year ended October 29, 2006.
    Compensation expense is calculated using the fair value of the
    employee’s purchase rights per the Black-Scholes model.
    Underlying assumptions used in the model are outlined in the
    following table:

Restricted
    Stock Units

Restricted stock units (also referred to as performance shares)
    are converted into shares of Applied common stock upon vesting
    on a

one-for-one

basis. Typically, vesting of restricted stock units is subject
    to the employee’s continuing service to Applied. The
    compensation expense related to these awards was determined
    using the fair value of Applied’s common stock on the date
    of the grant, and compensation is recognized over the service
    period. Restricted stock units generally vest over four years.

At October 29, 2006, Applied had $204 million total
    unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
    related to restricted stock unit grants, which will be
    recognized over the weighted average period of 1.7 years
    (see Note 8). During fiscal 2006, as part of the
    acquisition of Applied Films, Applied assumed Applied
    Films’ outstanding restricted stock awards that, at the
    acquisition date, had a fair value of $298,000, including
    $130,000 of total unrecognized equity-based compensation
    expense, net of estimated forfeitures. The Applied Films
    restricted stock awards assumed are expected to convert into
    19,000 shares of Applied common stock upon vesting.

Pro Forma
    Information under SFAS 123 for Periods Prior to Fiscal

Prior to fiscal 2006, Applied followed the disclosure-only
    provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 123, “Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation” (SFAS 123), as amended. The following
    table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per
    share for fiscal 2004 and fiscal 2005 if the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS 123, as amended, had been
    applied to options granted under Applied’s equity-based
    compensation plans. For purposes of this pro forma disclosure,
    the estimated value of the options is recognized over the
    options’ vesting periods. If Applied had recognized the
    expense of equity-based compensation programs in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations, additional paid-in
    capital would have increased by a corresponding amount, net of
    applicable taxes.

Based on the Black-Scholes option pricing model, the weighted
    average estimated fair value of employee stock option grants was
    $10.06 for fiscal 2004 and $6.46 for fiscal 2005. The weighted
    average estimated fair value of

purchase rights granted under the ESPP was $5.91 for fiscal 2004
    and $5.65 for fiscal 2005. Beginning in the first quarter of
    fiscal 2005, the computation of the expected volatility
    assumption used in the Black-Scholes calculations for new grants
    changed from being based solely on historical volatility to
    being based on a combination of historical and implied
    volatilities.

On August 4, 2005, the Human Resources and Compensation
    Committee of the Board of Directors of Applied approved the
    vesting acceleration of certain unvested,

out-of-the-money

stock options outstanding under Applied’s employee stock
    option plans, effective August 5, 2005. Stock options held
    by Applied’s five most senior executive officers,
    non-employee directors and consultants were not included in the
    vesting acceleration. Vesting was accelerated for stock options
    that had exercise prices greater than $17.85 per share,
    which was the closing price of Applied common stock on
    August 5, 2005. In connection with the modification of the
    terms of these options to accelerate their vesting,
    approximately $138 million was recorded as a non-cash
    compensation expense on a pro forma basis in accordance with
    SFAS 123, and this amount is included in the pro forma
    table above for the year ended October 30, 2005. This
    action was taken to reduce the impact of future compensation
    expense that Applied would otherwise be required to recognize in
    future consolidated statements of operations pursuant to
    SFAS 123(R), which was adopted by Applied beginning in the
    first quarter of fiscal 2006.

For additional information on Applied’s employee benefit
    plans, see Note 8 of Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

Financial
    instruments that potentially subject Applied to significant
    concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash
    equivalents, investments, trade accounts receivable and
    derivative financial instruments used in hedging activities.
    Applied invests in a variety of financial instruments, such as,
    but not limited to, certificates of deposit, corporate and
    municipal bonds, and United States Treasury and agency
    securities, mortgage-backed securities, and, by policy, limits
    the amount of credit exposure with any one financial institution
    or commercial issuer. Applied’s customers consist
    principally of semiconductor and display manufacturers located
    throughout the world. Applied performs ongoing credit
    evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and
    generally requires no collateral to secure accounts receivable.
    Applied maintains an allowance reserve for potentially
    uncollectible accounts receivable based on its assessment of the
    collectibility of accounts receivable. Applied regularly reviews
    the allowance by considering factors such as historical
    experience, credit quality, age of the accounts receivable
    balances, and current economic conditions that may affect a
    customer’s ability to pay. In addition, Applied utilizes
    letters of credit to mitigate credit risk when considered
    appropriate. Applied is exposed to credit-related losses in the
    event of nonperformance by counterparties to derivative
    financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to
    fail to meet their obligations.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is
    determined using the weighted average number of common shares
    outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is
    determined using the weighted average number of common shares
    and potential common shares (representing the dilutive effect of
    stock options, restricted stock units, ESPP shares and amounts
    due under the agreements associated with the accelerated buyback
    program) outstanding during the period. Applied’s net
    income has not been adjusted for any period presented for
    purposes of computing basic or diluted earnings per share.

For purposes of computing diluted earnings per share, weighted
    average potential common shares do not include stock options
    with an exercise price that exceeded the average fair market
    value of Applied’s common stock for the period, as the
    effect would be anti-dilutive. Options to purchase shares of
    common stock that were excluded from the computation were as
    follows:

Dividends

Applied’s Board of Directors
    declared three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of
    $0.03 per share each in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006,
    Applied’s Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash
    dividend in the amount of $0.03 per share and three
    quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.05 per share
    each. The fourth quarterly cash dividend declared in fiscal 2006
    was payable on December 7, 2006, to stockholders of record
    as of November 16, 2006. Dividends paid during fiscal 2005
    and fiscal 2006 totaled $98 million and $251 million,
    respectively. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at
    the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on
    Applied’s financial condition, results of operations,
    capital requirements, business conditions and other factors.

Recent
    Accounting Pronouncements

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158,
    “Employer’s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 87, 88, 106, and 132R” (SFAS 158).
    SFAS 158 requires an entity to recognize in its statement
    of financial condition the funded status of its defined benefit
    postretirement plans, measured as the difference between the
    fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation.
    SFAS 158 also requires an entity to recognize changes in
    the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan
    within accumulated other comprehensive income, net of tax, to
    the extent such changes are not recognized in earnings as
    components of periodic net benefit cost. SFAS 158 is
    effective for Applied in fiscal 2007. Applied does not expect
    the implementation of this standard to have a material effect on
    Applied’s financial position or results of operations.

In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157,
    “Fair Value” (SFAS 157). SFAS 157 defines
    fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and
    expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157
    is effective for Applied in fiscal 2009. Applied is evaluating
    the potential impact of the implementation of SFAS 157 on
    its financial position and results of operations.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering
    the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements When Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements”
    (SAB 108), which provides interpretive guidance on how the
    effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements
    should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement.
    SAB 108 is effective for Applied in fiscal 2007. Applied
    does not expect the implementation of this staff accounting
    bulletin to have a material effect on Applied’s financial
    position or results of operations.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation 48,
    “Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties”
    (FIN 48). FIN 48 defines the threshold for recognizing
    the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements
    as “more-likely-than-not” to be sustained by the
    taxing authority. The recently issued literature also provides
    guidance on the derecognition, measurement and classification of
    income tax uncertainties, along with any related interest and
    penalties. FIN 48 also includes guidance concerning
    accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and
    increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded
    income tax uncertainties. FIN 48 will become effective for
    Applied beginning in fiscal 2008. Any differences between the
    amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior
    to the adoption of FIN 48 and the amounts reported after
    adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative-effect adjustment
    recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings. Applied
    is evaluating the potential impact of the implementation of
    FIN 48 on its financial position and results of operations.

In February 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 155,
    “Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial
    Instruments — an amendment of FASB Statements
    No. 133 and 140” (SFAS 155). SFAS 155 amends
    SFAS No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedging Activities”, and No. 140,
    “Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities”. SFAS 155 also
    resolves issues addressed in SFAS 133 Implementation Issue
    No. D1, “Application of Statement 133 to
    Beneficial Interests in Securitized Financial Assets”.
    SFAS 155 (a) permits fair value remeasurement for any
    hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative
    that otherwise would require bifurcation, (b) clarifies
    which interest-only strips and principal-

only strips are not subject to the requirements of
    SFAS 133, (c) establishes a requirement to evaluate
    interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests
    that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial
    instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring
    bifurcation, (d) clarifies that concentrations of credit
    risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives,
    and (e) amends SFAS No. 140 to eliminate the
    prohibition on a qualifying special-purpose entity from holding
    a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial
    interest other than another derivative financial instrument.
    SFAS 155 is effective for all financial instruments
    acquired or issued after the beginning of Applied’s 2007
    fiscal year. Applied is currently assessing the impact of
    SFAS 155, however, it does not anticipate that
    SFAS 155 will have a material impact on its financial
    position and results of operations.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,
    “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections — a
    Replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement
    No. 3” (SFAS 154), which requires retrospective
    application to prior periods’ financial statements of
    voluntary changes in accounting principle unless it is
    impracticable to do so. SFAS 154 is effective for
    accounting changes and corrections of errors beginning in fiscal
    2007. Applied does not expect the implementation of this
    standard to have a material effect on Applied’s financial
    position or results of operations.

Securities with no single maturity date include publicly traded

Applied regularly reviews its investment portfolio to identify
    and evaluate investments that have indications of possible
    impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is
    temporary include: the length of time and extent to which fair
    market value has been lower than the cost basis, the financial
    condition and near-term prospects of the investee, credit
    quality, and Applied’s ability to hold the investment for a
    period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery
    in fair market value. Generally, the contractual terms of the
    investments do not permit settlement at prices less than the
    amortized cost of the investments. Applied has determined that
    the gross unrealized losses on its investments at
    October 29, 2006 are temporary in nature. The gross
    unrealized losses related to investments are primarily due to a
    decrease in the fair market value of fixed-rate debt securities
    as a result of increases in interest rates. Accordingly, Applied
    does not consider the investments to be

other-than-temporarily

impaired at October 29, 2006, as it has the ability and
    intent to hold the investments for a period of time that may be
    sufficient for anticipated recovery in fair market value.

Applied manages its cash equivalents and investments as a single
    portfolio of highly marketable securities that is intended to be
    available to meet Applied’s current cash requirements. For
    fiscal 2005, gross realized gains on sales of investments were
    $3 million, and gross realized losses were $8 million.
    For fiscal 2006, gross realized gains on sales of investments
    were $5 million, and gross realized losses were
    $28 million, principally attributable to the sale of
    investments to fund the accelerated stock buyback program
    discussed in Note 7.

During fiscal 2006, Applied changed its accounting method for
    certain fixed-income investments, which resulted in the
    reclassification of these investments from short-term
    investments to long-term investments. As a result, prior period
    balances have been reclassified to conform to the current
    period’s presentation. This accounting method is based on
    the contractual maturity dates of fixed-income securities as
    current or long-term, while the prior classification was based
    on the nature of the securities and the availability for use in
    current operations. Applied believes this presentation method is
    preferable as it is more reflective of Applied’s assessment
    of the timing of when such securities are expected to be
    converted to cash. Accordingly, certain fixed-income investments
    of $2.6 billion have been reclassified from short-term
    investments to long-term investments in the October 30,
    2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the fiscal 2006
    financial statement presentation. In connection with this
    reclassification, short-term deferred taxes have been
    reclassified to long-term deferred taxes. There have been no
    changes in Applied’s investment policies or practices
    associated with this change in accounting method.

In addition, $50 million of long-term equity securities
    previously reported in other long-term assets have been
    reclassified to long-term investments in the October 30,
    2005 Consolidated Balance Sheet to conform to the fiscal 2006
    financial statement presentation. Applied continues to classify
    auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes as
    current assets, notwithstanding the underlying contractual term
    of such investments, since the highly liquid nature of these
    investments enables them to be readily convertible to cash.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Derivative
    instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency
    exchange contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet at fair
    value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not
    qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion
    of any hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All of
    Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at
    their fair value in other current assets or accounts payable and
    accrued expenses.

Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with
    certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as
    Japanese yen, British pound, euro and Israeli shekel. The
    purpose of Applied’s foreign currency



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate
    fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues,
    costs and eventual cash flows. The terms of currency instruments
    used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the
    timing of the transactions being hedged.

Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward
    exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge
    certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions
    expected to occur within the next 12 months. Hedges related
    to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the
    inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for
    effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of the gain or
    loss on these hedges is reported as a component of accumulated
    other comprehensive income/(loss) in stockholders’ equity
    and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction
    affects earnings. Amounts included in accumulated other
    comprehensive income/(loss) at October 29, 2006 will
    generally be reclassified into earnings within 12 months.
    Changes in the fair value of currency forward exchange and
    option contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from
    the assessment of effectiveness and are recognized in cost of
    products sold. The change in option and forward time value was
    not material for fiscal 2004, 2005 or 2006. If the transaction
    being hedged fails to occur, or if a portion of any derivative
    is ineffective, Applied promptly recognizes the gain or loss on
    the associated financial instrument in general and
    administrative expenses. The amounts recognized due to
    anticipated transactions failing to occur were not material for
    all periods presented.

Forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain
    foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. These
    derivatives are not designated for hedge accounting treatment.
    Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are
    recorded promptly in earnings to offset the changes in the fair
    value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

Derivative-related activity in accumulated other comprehensive
    income/(loss) was as follows:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The
    carrying amounts of Applied’s financial instruments,
    including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes
    payable, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate
    fair value due to the short maturities of these financial
    instruments. At October 30, 2005, the carrying amount of
    long-term debt was $415 million and the estimated fair
    value was $432 million. At October 29, 2006, the
    carrying amount of long-term debt was $407 million and the
    estimated fair value was $428 million. The estimated fair
    value of long-term debt is based primarily on quoted market
    prices for the same or similar issues.

Goodwill is not amortized but reviewed for impairment annually
    during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Applied conducted
    goodwill impairment tests in fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2006, and
    the results of these tests indicated that Applied’s
    goodwill assets were not impaired. From October 30, 2005 to
    October 29, 2006, the change in goodwill was
    $234 million, due primarily to the acquisitions of Applied
    Films Corporation, a Colorado corporation (Applied Films),
    certain assets of UMS Solutions Pte. Ltd. (UMS Solutions), a
    wholly-owned subsidiary of Norelco UMS Holdings Limited, and
    ChemTrace Corporation and ChemTrace Precision Cleaning, Inc.
    (collectively, ChemTrace) and offset in part by other
    adjustments associated with previous acquisitions. Other assets
    that are not subject to amortization consist primarily of a
    trade name associated with the Metron Technology N.V.
    acquisition and is reported in the Fab Solutions segment. As of
    October 29, 2006 goodwill by reportable segment was:
    Silicon, $230 million; Display, $116 million; Fab
    Solutions, $89 million and Adjacent Technologies,
    $138 million. For additional details, see Note 13.

Purchased technology and other intangible assets are amortized
    over their estimated useful lives of 2 to 15 years using
    the straight-line method. From October 30, 2005 to
    October 29, 2006, the change in amortized intangible assets
    was approximately $120 million, primarily due to the
    acquisitions of Applied Films, certain assets of
    UMS Solutions, and ChemTrace. Aggregate amortization
    expense was $26 million and $31 million for fiscal
    2005 and 2006, respectively. As of October 29, 2006, future
    estimated amortization expense is expected to be
    $32 million for fiscal 2007, $27 million for fiscal
    2008, $26 million for fiscal 2009, $22 million for
    fiscal 2010, $19 million for fiscal 2011, and
    $57 million thereafter. As of October 29, 2006
    amortized intangible assets by reportable segment were: Silicon,
    $25 million; Display, $57 million; Fab Solutions,
    $19 million and Adjacent Technologies, $82 million.

Borrowing
    Facilities

At October 29, 2006, Applied had credit facilities for
    unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to
    approximately $260 million. On September 14, 2006,
    Applied entered into a $100 million

364-Day

Credit Agreement (Credit Agreement) with a bank. The Credit
    Agreement became effective on September 17, 2006 and



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

replaced a $250 million credit facility which expired on
    September 17, 2006. The Credit Agreement provides for
    borrowings (advances) not to exceed $100 million at
    interest rates keyed to one of various rates selected by Applied
    for each advance, plus, in certain cases, an applicable margin

and/or

a
    utilization fee. The Credit Agreement also requires payment of
    certain customary fees and expenses. Any advances under the
    Credit Agreement will be unsecured. The Credit Agreement
    includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in
    compliance at October 29, 2006. No amount was outstanding
    under the Credit Agreement at October 29, 2006. The
    remaining credit facilities of approximately $160 million
    are with Japanese banks at rates indexed to their prime
    reference rate and are denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts
    were outstanding under these Japanese credit facilities at
    October 29, 2006.

Applied has debt agreements that contain financial and other
    covenants. These covenants require Applied to maintain certain
    minimum financial ratios. At October 29, 2006, Applied was
    in compliance with all covenants.

Aggregate debt maturities at October 29, 2006 were:
    $203 million in fiscal 2007, $3 million in fiscal
    2008, $1 million in fiscal 2009, and $200 million
    thereafter.

Note 6

Restructuring
    and Asset Impairments

During fiscal 2006, Applied recognized restructuring and asset
    impairment charges of $212 million, including
    $128 million in asset impairments and $92 million in
    restructuring charges primarily associated with the closure of
    its Hayward, California facility, offset by $8 million in
    adjustments associated with realignment programs of prior years.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2006, Applied’s Board of
    Directors approved a plan to disinvest a portion of
    Applied’s real estate and facilities portfolio (the Plan).
    Properties with an estimated fair value of $56 million were
    reported as assets

held-for-sale

and reclassified from property, plant and equipment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Applied recorded an asset impairment
    charge of $124 million during the first quarter of fiscal
    2006 to write down the following properties to estimated fair
    value: facilities in Narita, Japan; Chunan, Korea; Hillsboro,
    Oregon; and Danvers, Massachusetts; and 26 acres of
    unimproved land in Hillsboro, Oregon. During the third quarter
    of fiscal 2006, Applied sold the Danvers, Massachusetts facility
    for net proceeds of $16 million and recognized a gain of
    $4 million. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006,
    Applied recorded additional impairment charges on the Narita and
    Chunan facilities of $6 million and recorded a
    restructuring charge of $4 million related to environmental
    contamination of the Narita site. As part of the Plan, Applied
    also recorded a charge in the amount of $91 million for

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

future lease obligations that continue through fiscal 2014
    related to the closure of its leased Hayward, California
    facility. During the second, third and fourth quarter of fiscal
    2006, Applied consumed $9 million in restructuring reserves
    related to the Hayward campus in rental and operating costs. In
    the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006, the Hayward lease obligation
    was terminated for $81 million. Applied continues to
    actively market the remaining properties.

Applied took restructuring actions in fiscal 2004 to align its
    cost structure with prevailing market conditions due to an
    industry downturn. These actions, which were necessary as a
    result of reduced business volume, decreased Applied’s
    global workforce and consolidated Applied’s global
    facilities. Restructuring, asset impairments and other charges
    for fiscal 2004 totaled $167 million, consisting of
    $65 million for facility consolidations, $6 million
    for severance and benefits, and $96 million for other
    costs, primarily related to fixed asset writeoffs due to
    facility consolidations. As of October 29, 2006, the
    majority of the fiscal 2004 restructuring actions have been
    completed, and restructuring reserve balances consisted
    principally of remaining lease commitments associated with
    facilities.

There were no restructuring, asset impairments or other charges
    for fiscal 2005.

Changes in restructuring reserves for fiscal 2004, 2005 and 2006

Stock Repurchase Program

Since March 1996,
    Applied has systematically repurchased shares of its common
    stock in the open market to partially fund its equity-based
    employee benefit and incentive plans. On September 15,
    2006, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase
    program of up to $5.0 billion in repurchases over the next
    three years, ending in September 2009. In fiscal 2005, there
    were 101,208,000 shares



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

repurchased at an average price of $16.80 per share. In
    fiscal 2006, there were 238,397,000 shares repurchased at
    an average price of $17.35 per share.

On September 18, 2006, Applied entered into accelerated
    stock buyback agreements with Goldman, Sachs & Co.
    (Goldman Sachs) under which Applied agreed to purchase from
    Goldman Sachs shares of Applied outstanding common stock for an
    initial purchase price of $2.5 billion. Under the
    agreements, Applied purchased from Goldman Sachs
    145 million shares of Applied’s common stock on
    September 18, 2006 at a price per share of $17.20, and
    Goldman Sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of shares
    in the open market over the following four months. At the end of
    the four month period, Applied is entitled or subject to a price
    adjustment with Goldman Sachs based upon the volume weighted
    average price of Applied common stock during the purchase
    period. The price adjustment, if any, may be settled, at
    Applied’s option, in cash or shares of its common stock.
    The repurchase was funded with Applied’s existing cash and
    investments. The repurchased shares were reported as treasury
    stock.

Dividends

Applied’s Board of Directors
    declared three quarterly cash dividends in the amount of
    $0.03 per share each in fiscal 2005. During fiscal 2006,
    Applied’s Board of Directors declared one quarterly cash
    dividend in the amount of $0.03 per share and three
    quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.05 per share
    each. The fourth quarterly cash dividend declared in fiscal 2006
    was paid on December 7, 2006 to stockholders of record as
    of November 16, 2006. Dividends paid during fiscal 2005 and
    fiscal 2006 amounted to $98 million and $251 million,
    respectively. The declaration of any future cash dividend is at
    the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on
    Applied’s financial condition, results of operations,
    capital requirements, business conditions and other factors as
    well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best
    interest of stockholders.

Employees Stock Purchase Plan

Applied sponsors
    two Employee Stock Purchase Plans (collectively, ESPP) for the
    benefit of United States (U.S.) and international employees,
    respectively. The U.S. plan is qualified under
    Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the ESPP,
    substantially all employees may purchase Applied common stock
    through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85 percent
    of the lower of the fair market value at the beginning of the
    offering period or at the end of each applicable purchase
    period. Beginning in December 2002, Applied amended the ESPP to
    extend the offering period from 6 months to 24 months,
    composed of four six-month purchase periods. ESPP contributions
    are limited to a maximum of 10 percent of an
    employee’s eligible compensation, up to a maximum of
    $6,500 per six-month purchase period. ESPP participants are
    also limited to purchasing a maximum of 1,000 shares per
    purchase period. Shares issued under the ESPP were 5,308,000 for
    fiscal 2004, 4,879,000 for fiscal 2005, and 4,065,000 for fiscal
    2006. At October 29, 2006, there were
    10,669,000 shares reserved for future issuance under the
    ESPP.

Equity-Based
    Compensation

See
    Note 1.

Employee Bonus Plans

Applied has various
    employee bonus plans. A profit-sharing plan provides for the
    distribution of a percentage of pre-tax profits to substantially
    all Applied employees not eligible for other performance-based
    incentive plans, up to a maximum percentage of compensation.
    Other plans award annual bonuses to Applied’s executives
    and key contributors based on the achievement of profitability
    and other specific performance criteria. Applied also has
    agreements with key technical employees that provide for
    additional compensation related to the success of new product
    development and achievement of specified profitability criteria.
    Charges to expense under these plans were $309 million for
    fiscal 2004, $138 million for fiscal 2005 and
    $262 million for fiscal 2006.

Employee Savings and Retirement
    Plan

Applied’s Employee Savings and
    Retirement Plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and
    (k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Applied contributes a
    percentage of each participating employee’s salary deferral
    contributions. These matching contributions generally become
    20 percent vested at the end of an employee’s second
    year of service with Applied, and vest 20 percent per year
    of service thereafter and become fully vested at the end of six
    years of service. Each participant may elect to have the Company
    matching contributions invested in any of the diversified
    investment funds available under the plan or in Applied common
    stock. Applied’s matching contributions under this plan
    were approximately $17 million, net of $8 million in
    forfeitures, for fiscal 2004 $25 million, net of
    $1 million in forfeitures, for fiscal 2005 and
    $27 million, net of $2 million in forfeitures, for
    fiscal 2006.

Defined Benefit Pension Plans of Foreign
    Subsidiaries

Several of Applied’s foreign
    subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans covering
    substantially all of their eligible employees. Benefits under
    these plans are typically based on years of service and final
    average compensation levels. Applied uses August 31 as a
    measurement date. The plans are managed in accordance with
    applicable local statutes and practices. Applied deposits funds
    for certain of these plans with insurance companies, pension
    trustees, government-managed accounts,

and/or

accrues the expense for the unfunded portion of the benefit
    obligation on its consolidated financial statements. Where
    appropriate, the pension plans retain professional investment
    managers that invest plan assets in equity securities, fixed
    income securities, cash and other institutional investments.
    Applied’s practice is to fund the various pension plans in
    amounts sufficient to meet the minimum requirements as
    established by applicable local governmental oversight and
    taxing authorities. Depending on the design of the plan, local
    custom and market circumstances, the liabilities of a plan may
    exceed qualified plan assets. The differences between the
    aggregate accumulated benefit obligations and aggregate plan
    assets of these plans have been recorded as liabilities by
    Applied and are included in accrued expenses and other
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Applied’s investment strategy for its defined benefit plans
    is to invest assets in a prudent manner, maintaining
    well-diversified portfolios with the long-term objective of
    meeting the obligations of the plans as they come due. Asset
    allocation decisions are typically made by plan fiduciaries with
    input from Applied’s pension committee. Applied’s
    asset allocation strategy incorporates a sufficient equity
    exposure in order for the plans to benefit from the expected
    long-term outperformance of equities relative to the plans’
    liabilities. Applied retains investment managers, where
    appropriate, to manage the assets of the plans. Performance of
    investment managers is monitored by plan fiduciaries with the
    assistance of local investment consultants. The investment
    managers make investment decisions within the guidelines set
    forth by plan fiduciaries. Risk management practices include
    diversification across asset classes and investment styles, and
    periodic rebalancing toward target asset allocation ranges.
    Investment managers may use derivative instruments for efficient
    portfolio management purposes. Plan assets do not include any of
    Applied’s own equity or debt securities.

A summary of the components of net periodic pension costs and
    the weighted average assumptions used for net periodic pension
    cost and benefit obligation calculations for fiscal 2004, 2005
    and 2006 is presented below.

Asset return assumptions are derived based on actuarial and
    statistical methodologies, from analysis of long-term historical
    data relevant to the country in which each plan is in effect and
    the investments applicable to the corresponding plan. The
    discount rate for each plan was derived by reference to
    appropriate benchmark yields on high quality corporate bonds,
    allowing for the approximate duration of both plan obligations
    and the relevant benchmark index.

Future expected benefit payments over the next ten fiscal years
    are: $5 million in fiscal 2007, $5 million in fiscal
    2008, $6 million in fiscal 2009, $7 million in fiscal
    2010, $7 million in fiscal 2011, and $42 million
    collectively for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Company
    contributions to these plans for fiscal 2007 are expected to be
    approximately $8 million.

Executive Deferred Compensation Plans

Applied
    sponsors two unfunded deferred compensation plans, the Executive
    Deferred Compensation Plan (Predecessor EDCP) and the 2005
    Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (2005 EDCP), under which
    certain employees may elect to defer a portion of their
    following year’s eligible earnings. The Predecessor EDCP
    was frozen as of December 31, 2004 such that no new
    deferrals could be made under the plan after that date and the
    plan would qualify for “grandfather” relief under
    Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code. The Predecessor
    EDCP participant accounts continue to be maintained under the
    plan and credited with deemed interest. The 2005 EDCP was
    adopted by Applied effective as of January 1, 2005 and is
    intended to

comply with the requirements of Code Section 409A. Amounts
    payable, including accrued deemed interest, totaled
    $83 million at October 30, 2005 and $79 million
    at October 29, 2006, which were included in other long-term
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Post-Retirement Benefits

On January 1,
    1999, Applied adopted a plan that provides certain medical and
    vision benefits to eligible retirees who are at least
    age 55 and who have at least 10 years of service at
    their date of retirement. An eligible retiree may elect coverage
    for an eligible spouse or domestic partner who is not eligible
    for Medicare. Coverage under the plan generally ends for both
    the retiree and spouse or domestic partner upon becoming
    eligible for Medicare. This plan has not had, and is not
    expected to have, a material effect on Applied’s
    consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

U.S. income taxes have not been provided for approximately
    $217 million of cumulative undistributed earnings of
    several

non-U.S. subsidiaries.

Applied intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely in
    operations outside of the U.S.

As of October 29, 2006, Applied’s net operating loss
    and state tax credit carryforwards for tax return purposes were
    $64 million. The carry forwards have an indefinite life.
    Management believes that tax credit carryforwards will be
    utilized in future periods.

Applied’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax
    benefits associated with employee stock option transactions.
    These benefits, credited directly to stockholders’ equity,
    amounted to $84 million for fiscal 2005 and
    $24 million for fiscal 2006, with a corresponding reduction
    to taxes payable of $84 million in fiscal 2005 and
    $24 million in fiscal 2006.

The Internal Revenue Service has completed its field examination
    of Applied’s federal income tax returns for fiscal years
    2002 through 2004 and has issued a preliminary report.
    Management believes that adequate amounts have been accrued for
    adjustments resulting from the examination.

Note 10

Industry
    Segment and Geographic Operations

After the acquisition of Applied Films, Applied made certain
    changes to its internal financial reporting structure during the
    fourth quarter of fiscal 2006 and, as a result, is reporting
    four segments: Silicon, Fab Solutions, Display, and Adjacent
    Technologies. Applied’s chief operating decision-maker has
    been identified as the President and CEO, who reviews operating
    results to make decisions about allocating resources and
    assessing performance for the entire Company. Segment
    information is presented based upon Applied’s management
    organization structure as of October 29, 2006 and the
    distinctive nature of each segment. Future changes to this
    internal financial structure may result in changes to the
    reportable segments disclosed. Prior to the fourth quarter of
    fiscal 2006, Applied operated in one reportable segment.

Each reportable segment is separately managed and has separate
    financial results that are reviewed by Applied’s chief
    operating decision-maker. Each reportable segment contains
    closely related products that are unique to the particular
    segment. Segment operating income is determined based upon
    internal performance measures used by the President and CEO.

Applied derives the segment results directly from its internal
    management reporting system. The accounting policies Applied
    uses to derive reportable segment results are substantially the
    same as those the consolidated Company uses. Management measures
    the performance of each reportable segment based upon several
    metrics including orders, net sales and operating income.
    Management uses these results to evaluate the performance of,
    and to assign resources to, each of the reportable segments.
    Applied does not allocate to its reportable segments certain
    operating expenses, which it manages separately at the corporate
    level. These unallocated costs include equity-based
    compensation, regional marketing and sales, corporate functions
    (certain management, finance, legal, human resources and
    RD&E costs) and unabsorbed information technology and
    occupancy costs. In addition, Applied does not allocate to its
    reportable segments restructuring and asset impairment charges
    and any associated adjustments related to restructuring actions.



APPLIED
    MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO
    CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS —
    (Continued)

Segment operating income excludes interest income/expense and
    other financial charges and income taxes according to how a
    particular reportable segment’s management is measured.

The Silicon segment comprises a wide range of semiconductor
    manufacturing equipment that customers use to perform most of
    the steps in the chip fabrication process, including: atomic
    layer deposition, chemical vapor deposition, physical vapor
    deposition, electrochemical plating, etch, ion implantation,
    rapid thermal processing, chemical mechanical planarization,
    wafer wet cleaning, and wafer metrology and inspection.

The Fab Solutions segment offers a broad range of products and
    services designed to improve the performance and productivity of
    semiconductor manufacturers’ fab operations.

The Display segment manufactures, sells and services equipment
    used to fabricate and test flat panel displays (FPD) for
    televisions, computer displays and other applications. With the
    acquisition of Applied Films, the Display segment expanded into
    equipment to manufacture color filters for flat panel displays.

The Adjacent Technologies segment manufactures, sells and
    services equipment used to fabricate solar photovoltaic cells,
    flexible electronics and energy-efficient glass.

Prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
    fiscal 2006 presentation.

Information for each reportable segment as of October 31,
    2004, October 30, 2005 and October 29, 2006 and for
    the years then ended, is as follows:

Commitments
    and Contingencies

Leases

Applied leases some of its facilities and equipment under
    non-cancelable operating leases and has options to renew most
    leases, with rentals to be negotiated. Total rent expense was
    $88 million for fiscal 2004, $87 million for fiscal
    2005, and $70 million for fiscal 2006. Future minimum lease
    payments at October 29, 2006 totaled $173 million and
    were: $60 million for fiscal 2007; $41 million for
    fiscal 2008; $31 million for fiscal 2009; $17 million
    for fiscal 2010; $8 million for fiscal 2011; and
    $16 million collectively for all periods thereafter.

Accounts
    Receivables Sales

Applied has agreements with various financial institutions to
    sell accounts receivable from selected customers. Applied also
    discounts letters of credit through various financial
    institutions. Under these agreements, Applied sold accounts
    receivable and discounted letters of credit in the amounts of
    $859 million for fiscal 2004, $158 million for fiscal
    2005 and $245 million for fiscal 2006. Discounting fees
    were not material for all periods presented. At October 29,
    2006, the amount of sold accounts receivable remained
    outstanding under these agreements was immaterial. A portion of
    these sold accounts receivable is subject to certain recourse
    provisions. Applied has not experienced any losses under these
    recourse provisions.

Guarantees

Applied products are generally sold with a

12-month

warranty period following installation. The provision for the
    estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is
    recognized. Parts and labor are covered under the terms of the
    warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based on
    historical experience by product, configuration and geographic
    region.

As noted above, Applied’s products are generally sold with
    a

warranty. Accordingly, current warranty provisions are related
    to the current year’s net sales, and warranty consumption
    is associated with current and prior year’s net sales.

During the ordinary course of business, Applied also provides
    standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to
    certain parties as required for certain transactions initiated
    by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of October 29,
    2006, the maximum potential amount of future payments that
    Applied could be required to make under these guarantee
    agreements was approximately $114 million. Applied has not
    recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee
    arrangements beyond that required to appropriately account for
    the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not
    believe, based on historical experience and information
    currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will
    be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements.

Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate
    subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft
    arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of
    credit. As of October 29, 2006, Applied Materials Inc. has
    provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately
    $91 million to cover these services.

Legal
    Matters

On July 31, 2001, David Scharf, an individual, filed a
    lawsuit against Applied alleging that Applied has infringed, has
    induced others to infringe, and has contributed to others’
    infringement of, a patent concerning color synthesizing scanning
    electron microscope technology. Mr. Scharf seeks a
    preliminary and permanent injunction, a finding of willful
    infringement, damages (including treble damages), and costs.
    Applied has answered the complaint and counterclaimed for
    declaratory judgment of non-infringement and invalidity. On
    May 10, 2002, Mr. Scharf filed a request for
    re-examination of his patent with the Patent and Trademark
    Office (PTO). On June 26, 2002, the case was removed from
    the Court’s active docket after the parties stipulated to
    stay the case pending the results of that re-examination. On
    July 11, 2002, Applied filed its own request for
    re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s patent with the Patent
    and Trademark Office. Applied’s request for re-examination
    was granted on September 19, 2002. On April 23, 2004,
    the PTO notified Applied that it intended to issue a
    re-examination certificate. On June 14, 2004, Applied filed
    a second request for re-examination of Mr. Scharf’s
    patent with the PTO. The second request was denied on
    September 1, 2004. On October 1, 2004, Applied filed a
    petition for reconsideration of that denial, which subsequently
    was denied. The parties are engaged in discovery and on
    November 6, 2006, the Court heard opposing motions for
    summary judgment on the issue of infringement and claim
    construction. The Court has not yet ruled on these motions.
    Applied believes it has meritorious defenses and counterclaims
    and intends to pursue them vigorously.

On March 12, 2002, Linear Technology Corp. (LTC) filed a
    lawsuit against Applied in the Superior Court of the County of
    Santa Clara, California, alleging claims for breach of
    contract, fraud and deceit, negligent misrepresentation,
    suppression of fact, unfair competition, breach of warranty,
    express contractual indemnity, implied equitable indemnity and
    declaratory relief related to LTC’s assertion that Applied
    is obligated to indemnify and defend LTC for certain claims in
    an underlying patent infringement lawsuit brought by Texas
    Instruments, Inc. After the Court dismissed many of its claims,
    LTC amended its complaint. LTC’s Amended Complaint, as well
    as its Second, Third and Fourth Amended Complaints, were
    dismissed by the Court in whole or in part. On July 7,
    2004, LTC filed a Fifth Amended Complaint, which the Court
    dismissed with prejudice on October 5, 2004. On
    January 11, 2005, LTC filed a notice of appeal of the
    dismissal of its complaint. Applied believes it has meritorious
    defenses and intends to pursue them vigorously.

On December 24, 2003, Applied filed a lawsuit against
    Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. (Jusung Engineering) and Jusung
    Pacific Co., Ltd. (Jusung Pacific, referred to together with
    Jusung Engineering as Jusung) in Tao-Yuan District Court in
    Taiwan, captioned Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung
    Engineering Co., Ltd. The lawsuit alleges that Jusung is
    infringing a patent related to chemical vapor deposition owned
    by Applied. In the lawsuit, Applied seeks a provisional
    injunction prohibiting Jusung from importing, using,
    manufacturing, servicing or selling in Taiwan certain flat panel
    display manufacturing equipment. On December 25, 2003, the
    Tao-Yuan District Court ruled in favor of Applied’s request
    for a provisional injunction and, on January 14, 2004, the
    Court issued a provisional injunction order against Jusung
    Pacific. Jusung Pacific appealed those decisions, and the
    decisions were affirmed on appeal. On January 30, 2004,
    Jusung Pacific requested permission to post a counterbond to
    have the Jusung Pacific injunction lifted. Jusung Pacific’s
    counterbond request was granted and, on March 30, 2004, the
    provisional injunction order was lifted. At Applied’s
    request, on December 11, 2004, the District Court issued a
    provisional injunction order against Jusung Engineering. Jusung
    Engineering appealed that order, and the order was affirmed on
    appeal. Jusung Engineering also requested permission to post a
    counterbond to have the Jusung Engineering injunction lifted.
    Jusung Engineering’s counterbond request was granted, and,
    on April 25, 2005, the provisional injunction order against
    Jusung Engineering was lifted. Applied has appealed both
    counterbond decisions. On June 30, 2004, Applied filed a
    “main action” patent infringement complaint against
    Jusung in the Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan, captioned
    Applied Materials, Inc. v. Jusung Engineering Co., Ltd. In
    the lawsuit, Applied seeks damages and a permanent injunction
    for infringement of the same patent. The decisions regarding the
    provisional injunction and counterbond have no effect on the
    separate patent infringement lawsuit filed by Applied against
    Jusung in the Hsinchu Court. In August 2006, the Court set the
    litigation fee and the litigation security payment, and the main
    action is now proceeding on its merits. The Court held a second
    hearing in the main action on October 30,

2006. This same patent is the subject of an invalidity
    proceeding filed in the Taiwanese Patent and Trademark Office by
    Jusung Pacific in June 2004. Applied believes it has meritorious
    claims and intends to pursue them vigorously.

On June 13, 2006, Applied filed an action in the Taiwanese
    Patent and Trademark Office challenging the validity of a patent
    owned by Jusung Engineering related to the severability of the
    transfer chamber. On June 20, 2006, Jusung Engineering
    filed a lawsuit against Applied and Applied’s subsidiary,
    AKT, in Hsinchu District Court in Taiwan, captioned Jusung
    Engineering, Co. Ltd. v. AKT America, Inc. and Applied
    Materials, Inc., alleging infringement of this patent. Jusung
    Engineering’s lawsuit seeks damages, costs and
    attorneys’ fees, but does not seek injunctive relief. The
    Court has scheduled the first hearing in this matter for
    December 28, 2006. Applied believes that it has meritorious
    defenses that it intends to pursue vigorously.

On April 10, 2004, the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC)
    notified Applied’s subsidiary AKT that, pursuant to a
    complaint filed by Jusung, the TFTC had begun an investigation
    into whether AKT had violated the Taiwan Fair Trade Act. The
    investigation focuses on whether AKT violated the Taiwan
    Guidelines for the Review of Cases Involving Enterprises Issuing
    Warning Letters for Infringement on Copyright, Trademark and
    Patent Rights by allegedly notifying customers about AKT’s
    patent rights and the infringement of those rights by Jusung. On
    June 15, 2004, the TFTC notified Applied that Applied also
    was the subject of the investigation. By letter dated
    April 15, 2005, the TFTC notified Applied and AKT that
    there was insufficient evidence to support a claim against
    either company. Jusung appealed the TFTC’s decision, and
    the appeals court affirmed the decision of the TFTC in favor of
    Applied on February 7, 2006. Jusung has appealed the
    appeals court’s affirmation of the decision of the TFTC.

On January 19, 2006, five companies that sell refurbished
    Applied tools (Silicon Services Consortium Inc., Semiconductor
    Support Services Co., OEM Surplus, Inc., Precision Technician
    Inc., and Semiconductor Equipment Specialist, Inc.) filed a
    lawsuit against Applied in the United States District Court for
    the Western District of Texas, captioned Silicon Services
    Consortium, Inc., et al. v. Applied Materials, Inc.
    The plaintiffs claim that a policy that Applied announced in
    January 2005 of limiting the sale of certain parts to them
    constituted an unlawful attempt to monopolize the refurbishment
    business, an interference with existing contracts, and an
    interference with prospective business relationships. The suit
    seeks injunctive relief, damages, costs and attorneys’
    fees. After Applied filed a motion to dismiss the original
    complaint, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint alleging
    similar conduct. Applied filed a motion to dismiss the amended
    complaint on April 7, 2006, and a hearing before the Court
    was conducted on August 22, 2006. The Court has not yet
    ruled on these motions. Applied believes it has meritorious
    defenses and counterclaims and intends to pursue them vigorously.

Applied does not believe that the outcome of any of the above
    matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial
    condition or results of operations. From time to time, Applied
    receives notification from third parties, including customers
    and suppliers, seeking indemnification, litigation support,
    payment of money or other actions by Applied in connection with
    claims made against them. In addition, from time to time,
    Applied receives notification from third parties claiming that
    Applied may be or is infringing their intellectual property or
    other rights. Applied also is subject to various other legal
    proceedings and claims, both asserted and unasserted, that arise
    in the ordinary course of business. Although the outcome of
    these claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty,
    Applied does not believe that any of these other existing
    proceedings or claims will have a material adverse effect on its
    consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Business
    Combinations and Equity-Method Investment

On August 14, 2006, Applied’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Metron Technology, Inc. (Metron), purchased certain assets of
    UMS Solutions’ parts cleaning and recycling business in
    Singapore for $10 million. The acquisition enhances
    Metron’s capabilities in Southeast Asia with advanced,
    high-quality parts cleaning services to support its
    customers’ semiconductor manufacturing requirements. In
    connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $7 million and other intangible assets of $1 million.

On July 20, 2006, Applied and Screen completed the
    formation of Sokudo, a Japanese joint venture company, to
    deliver advanced track solutions for customers’ critical
    semiconductor manufacturing requirements. Screen owns
    52 percent and holds the controlling interest in Sokudo,
    and Applied owns 48 percent. Screen transferred into Sokudo
    its existing track business and related intellectual property,
    including employees, products and its installed base of systems.
    Applied paid $147 million for its investment in Sokudo.
    Additionally, Applied contributed to Sokudo certain technology
    and related intellectual property and will provide key
    development employees. Screen performs manufacturing for Sokudo
    under an outsourcing agreement. Applied accounts for its
    interest in Sokudo under the equity method of accounting. Under
    this accounting method, Applied’s exposure to loss from
    ongoing operations is limited to $144 million as of
    October 29, 2006, which represents Applied’s carrying
    value of its investment in Sokudo. Applied’s investment in
    Sokudo is classified as an equity-method investment on the
    Consolidated Balance Sheet. Applied’s investment in Sokudo
    includes the unamortized excess of Applied’s investment
    over its equity in the joint venture’s net assets. This
    excess $41 million at October 29, 2006 is being
    amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated economic
    useful life of 7 years.

On July 7, 2006, Applied completed its acquisition of
    Applied Films Corporation, a Colorado corporation (Applied
    Films) and leading supplier of thin film deposition equipment
    used in manufacturing flat panel displays (FPDs), solar cells,
    flexible electronics and energy-efficient glass. Applied paid
    $28.50 per share in cash for each outstanding share of
    Applied Films. The total purchase price was approximately
    $484 million, or $328 million net of Applied
    Films’ existing cash and marketable securities. As part of
    the acquisition, Applied assumed Applied Films’ outstanding
    stock options and restricted stock awards that, at the
    acquisition date, had a total fair value of $26 million, of
    which $18 million was allocated to the purchase price and
    the remainder to unearned compensation. Upon the acquisition and
    subject to vesting, Applied Films stock options became
    exercisable for shares of Applied common stock and Applied Films
    restricted stock awards became payable in shares of Applied
    common stock totaling, in the aggregate, 3 million shares
    of Applied common stock. The fair value of Applied Films’
    stock options assumed was determined using a Black-Scholes
    model. The use of the Black-Scholes model and method of
    determining the variables is consistent with Applied’s
    valuation of equity-based compensation awards in accordance with
    SFAS 123(R) (see Note 1). Applied recorded an
    in-process research and development expense of $14 million,
    reported as research, development and engineering expense in the
    Consolidated Statements of Operations; goodwill of
    $226 million; and other intangible assets of
    $140 million. The acquired in-process research and
    development expense was determined by identifying research
    projects for which technological feasibility had not been
    established and no alternative future use existed. The value of
    the projects identified as in-process was determined by
    estimating the future cash flows from the projects once
    commercially feasible, discounting the net cash flows back to
    their present value at a rate commensurate with the level of
    risk and maturity of the projects, and then applying a
    percentage of completion to the calculated value.

On December 23, 2005, Applied acquired all of the
    outstanding shares of ChemTrace Corporation and ChemTrace
    Precision Cleaning, Inc. (collectively, ChemTrace) for
    approximately $22 million in cash, net of cash acquired, of
    which $18 million was paid upon closing. ChemTrace provides
    customers with precision parts cleaning and materials testing
    solutions. In connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded
    goodwill of $12 million and other intangible assets of
    $8 million.

On June 28, 2005, Applied purchased certain assets of SCP
    Global Technology, Inc., consisting of single-wafer HF-last
    immersion technology and Marangoni clean/dry intellectual
    property, for approximately $24 million in cash. In
    connection with this asset purchase, Applied recorded purchased
    technology and other intangible assets of $20 million and
    other items of $4 million.

On December 16, 2004, Applied acquired the assets of ATMI,
    Inc.’s Treatment Systems business (EcoSys), which supported
    the gas abatement requirements of process equipment for
    integrated circuit manufacturing and other industrial
    applications, for approximately $16 million in cash. In
    connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of
    $5 million, purchased technology and other intangible
    assets of $8 million and other items of $3 million,
    including liabilities assumed upon acquisition.

On December 14, 2004, Applied acquired substantially all of
    the operating subsidiaries and businesses of Metron Technology
    N.V., a provider of a range of products and services for
    fab-wide operations, for approximately $85 million in cash.
    In connection with this acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill
    of $76 million and other intangible assets of
    $31 million, partially offset by other items of
    $22 million, primarily for net liabilities assumed upon
    acquisition.

On June 14, 2004, Applied acquired Torrex Equipment
    Corporation, a developer of a multi-wafer system that utilizes
    chemical vapor deposition and atomic layer deposition processes
    to address front-end semiconductor manufacturing applications,
    for $7 million in cash. In connection with this
    acquisition, Applied recorded goodwill of $11 million, net
    of adjustments to the initial purchase price allocation,
    partially offset by other items of $4 million, primarily
    for net liabilities assumed upon acquisition. The in-process
    research and development expense related to this transaction was
    $5.8 million.

For all of the purchase business combinations discussed above,
    the results of operations prior to the acquisition dates were
    not material in relation to those of Applied for any of the
    periods presented herein. Goodwill is not amortized but is
    reviewed periodically for impairment and purchased technology is
    amortized over its useful life of 2 to 15 years.

Subsequent
    Event

On November 6, 2006 Applied announced that it had entered
    into an agreement to purchase the assets of Brooks Software, a
    division of Brooks Automation, Inc., for $125 million in
    cash. Brooks Software is a leading provider of factory
    management and control software to the semiconductor and flat
    panel display industries. Brooks Software’s products
    complement Applied’s’ existing software applications
    and are expected to enable Applied to offer customers a
    comprehensive computer integrated manufacturing
    (CIM) solution for optimizing fab operations. After the
    closing of this transaction, the Brooks Software business and
    employees will be integrated within the Applied Global Services
    organization and reported under the Fab Solutions segment.
    Completion of this acquisition is expected in the second quarter
    of fiscal 2007 and is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals
    and certain other closing conditions.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

The Stockholders and Board of Directors

Applied Materials, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of
    October 29, 2006 and October 30, 2005, and the related
    consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’
    equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year
    period ended October 29, 2006. In connection with our
    audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have
    audited the financial statement schedule as of and for each of
    the years in the three-year period ended October 29, 2006,
    listed at Item 15(a)(2). These consolidated financial
    statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred
    to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial
    position of Applied Materials, Inc. and subsidiaries as of
    October 29, 2006 and October 30, 2005, and the results
    of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years
    in the three-year period ended October 29, 2006, in
    conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
    principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial
    statement schedule as of and for each of the years in the three
    year period ended October 29, 2006, when considered in
