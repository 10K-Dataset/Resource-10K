ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K



PART I

ITEM 1.

BUSINESS

General

Our principal business activities are the development, marketing and distribution of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. The brand’s moisture-wicking
fabrications are engineered in many designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. Our products are sold worldwide and are worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional,
on playing fields around the globe, as well as consumers with active lifestyles.

Our net revenues are generated primarily
from the wholesale distribution of our products to national, regional, independent and specialty retailers. We also generate net revenue from product licensing and from the sale of our products through our direct to consumer sales channel, which
includes sales through our factory house and specialty stores, website and catalogs. Our products are offered in over twenty three thousand retail stores worldwide. A large majority of our products are sold in North America; however we believe that
our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. Internationally, we sell our products in certain countries in Europe, a third party licensee sells our products in Japan, and distributors sell our products in
other foreign countries. We plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and
expansion in international markets. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers operating in 22 countries outside of the United States.

We were incorporated as a Maryland corporation in 1996. As used in this report, the terms “we,”
“our,” “us,” “Under Armour” and the “Company” refer to Under Armour, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. We have registered trademarks around the globe, including UNDER ARMOUR

®

, HEATGEAR

®

, COLDGEAR

®

, ALLSEASONGEAR

®

and the Under Armour UA Logo, and we have applied to register many other trademarks. This Annual Report on Form 10-K
also contains additional trademarks and tradenames of our Company and other companies. All trademarks and tradenames appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective holders.

Products

Our product offerings consist of apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. We market our products at multiple price levels and provide consumers with what we believe to be a superior
alternative to traditional athletic products. In 2010, sales of apparel, footwear and accessories represented 80%, 12% and 4% of net revenues, respectively. Licensing arrangements for the sale of our products represented the remaining 4% of net
revenues. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for net revenues by product.

Apparel

Our apparel is offered in a variety of styles and fits intended to enhance comfort and mobility, regulate body
temperature and improve performance regardless of weather conditions. Our apparel is engineered to replace traditional non-performance fabrics in the world of athletics and fitness with performance alternatives designed and merchandised along
gearlines. Our three gearlines are marketed to tell a very simple story about our highly technical products and extend across the sporting goods, outdoor and active lifestyle markets. We market our apparel for consumers to choose HEATGEAR

®

when it is hot, COLDGEAR

®

when it is cold and
ALLSEASONGEAR

®

between the extremes. Within each gearline our apparel comes in three fit types: compression
(tight fit), fitted (athletic fit) and loose (relaxed).



HEATGEAR

®

is designed to be worn in warm to hot temperatures under equipment or as a single layer. Our first compression T-shirt was the original HEATGEAR

®

product and remains one of our signature styles. While a sweat-soaked traditional non-performance T-shirt can weigh
two to three pounds, HEATGEAR

®

is engineered with a microfiber blend designed to wick moisture from the body
which helps the body stay cool, dry and light. We offer HEATGEAR

®

in a variety of tops and bottoms in a broad
array of colors and styles for wear in the gym or outside in warm weather.

Because athletes sweat in cold
weather as well as in the heat, COLDGEAR

®

is designed to wick moisture from the body while circulating body heat
from hot spots to help maintain core body temperature. Our COLDGEAR

®

apparel provides both dryness and warmth in
a single light layer that can be worn beneath a jersey, uniform, protective gear or ski-vest and our COLDGEAR

®

outerwear products protect the athlete, as well as the coach and the fan from the outside in. Our COLDGEAR

®

product offerings generally sell at higher prices than our other gearlines.

ALLSEASONGEAR

®

is designed to be worn in changing temperatures and uses technical fabrics to keep the wearer cool and dry in warmer
temperatures while preventing a chill in cooler temperatures.

Footwear

We began offering footwear for men, women and youth in 2006, and each year we have expanded our footwear offerings. Our footwear offerings
include football, baseball, lacrosse, softball and soccer cleats, slides, performance training footwear, running footwear and basketball footwear. Our footwear is light, breathable and built with performance attributes for athletes. Our footwear is
designed with innovative technologies which provide stabilization, directional cushioning and moisture management engineered to maximize the athlete’s comfort and control. During 2010, we introduced basketball footwear, which had a limited
introduction in the United States and Canada.

Accessories

Our baseball batting, football, golf and running gloves include HEATGEAR

®

and COLDGEAR

®

technologies and are designed with advanced fabrications to provide the same level of performance as our other products. Net revenues generated from the sale of
baseball batting, football, golf and running gloves are included in our accessories category.

We also have agreements with
our licensees to develop Under Armour accessories. Our product, marketing and sales teams are actively involved in all steps of the design process in order to maintain brand standards and consistency. During 2010, our licensees offered bags, socks,
headwear, custom-molded mouth guards and eyewear designed to be used and worn before, during and after competition, and feature performance advantages and functionality similar to our other product offerings. License revenues generated from the sale
of these accessories are included in our net revenues. We have developed our own headwear and bags, and beginning in 2011, these products are being sold by us rather than by one of our licensees.

Marketing and Promotion

We currently focus on marketing and selling our products to consumers for use in athletics, fitness, training and outdoor activities. We maintain control over our brand image with an in-house marketing
and promotions department that designs and produces most of our advertising campaigns. We seek to drive consumer demand for our products by building brand equity and awareness as a leading performance athletic brand.

Sports Marketing

Our
marketing and promotion strategy begins with selling our products to high-performing athletes and teams on the high school, collegiate and professional levels. We execute this strategy through outfitting



agreements, professional and collegiate sponsorships, individual athlete agreements and by selling our products directly to team equipment managers and to individual athletes. As a result, our
products are seen on the field, giving them exposure to various consumer audiences through the internet, television, magazines and live at sporting events. This exposure to consumers helps us establish on-field authenticity as consumers can see our
products being worn by high-performing athletes. We are the official outfitter of the athletic teams at Auburn University (the 2011 BCS National Champions), Boston College, Texas Tech University, the University of Maryland, the University of South
Carolina and the University of South Florida. We are the official outfitter of numerous other teams, including the football teams at the University of Hawaii and the University of Utah. We supply uniforms, sideline apparel and fan gear for these
teams. In addition, we sell our products domestically to professional football teams and Division I men’s and women’s collegiate athletic teams. Since 2006 we have been an official supplier of footwear to the National Football League
(“NFL”), a step we took to complete the circle of authenticity from the Friday night lights of high school to Saturday afternoon college game day to the marquee Sunday match-ups of the NFL. In 2010 we signed an agreement to become an
official supplier of gloves to the NFL beginning in 2011 and combine training apparel beginning in 2012. This relationship enables NFL players to wear Under Armour products on the field and at the combine and enables Under Armour to reach fans at
the highest level of competitive football.

Internationally, we are selling our products to European soccer and rugby teams.
We are the official supplier of performance apparel to the Hannover 96 football club and the Welsh Rugby Union, among others. In addition, we are an official supplier of performance apparel to Hockey Canada and have advertising rights throughout the
Air Canada Center during the Toronto Maple Leafs’ home games. We have also been designated as the Official Performance Product Sponsor of the Toronto Maple Leafs.

We also have sponsorship agreements with individual athletes. Our strategy is to find the next generation of stars, like Milwaukee Bucks point guard Brandon Jennings, U.S. professional skier and Olympic
gold medal winner Lindsey Vonn, professional lacrosse player Paul Rabil, Baltimore Orioles catcher Matthew Wieters, National League Rookie of the Year and World Series Champion Buster Posey, UFC Welterweight Champion Georges St-Pierre and the number
one pick in the 2010 Major League Baseball Draft, Bryce Harper of the Washington Nationals. In addition, our roster of athletes includes established stars such as professional football players Tom Brady, Brandon Jacobs, Miles Austin, Vernon Davis
and Anquan Boldin, triathlon champion Chris “Macca” McCormack, professional baseball players Ryan Zimmerman and Jose Reyes, U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team players Heather Mitts and Lauren Cheney, U.S. Olympic and professional
volleyball player Nicole Branagh, U.S. Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, and professional golfer Hunter Mahan.

We seek to
sponsor events to drive awareness and brand authenticity from a grassroots level. For example, we entered into an agreement with IMG Academies for the development of a unique, comprehensive athletic training platform that we believe will establish a
global measurement standard for sports performance, health and fitness. In 2010, we hosted over 50 combines, camps and clinics for many sports at regional sites across the country for male and female athletes.

We reach young football athletes at all levels by sponsoring American Youth Football, a football organization that promotes the
development of youth; the Under Armour All-America Football Game, which is an annual competition between the top seniors in high school football; and the Under Armour Senior Bowl, which is an annual competition between the top seniors in college
football. In addition, we are the presenting sponsor for the 2010 NFL Scouting Combine.

We partner with Ripken Baseball to
outfit Ripken Baseball participants and to be the title sponsor for all 25 Ripken youth baseball tournaments, reaching 35,000 young athletes. In addition, we partner with the Baseball Factory to outfit the nation’s top high school baseball
athletes from head-to-toe and serve as the title sponsor for nationally recognized baseball tournaments and teams. In addition, beginning with the upcoming 2011 season, we are the Official Footwear Supplier of Major League Baseball.



We are the title sponsor of The Under Armour (Baltimore) Marathon and we have a strong brand
presence at several other major running events across the country. We are also the title sponsor of The Under Armour All-America Lacrosse Classic, as well as the All-America games in softball and volleyball for elite high school athletes. We believe
these relationships create significant on-field product and brand exposure that contributes to our on-field authenticity.

Media and
Promotion

We feature our products in a variety of national digital, broadcast, and print media
outlets. Our media campaigns run in a variety of lengths and formats and have included our signature “Protect this House” and “Click-Clack” campaigns featuring several NFL players. Our “Protect this House” campaign
continues to be used in several NFL and collegiate stadiums during games as a crowd prompt. Our ability to secure product placement in movies, television shows and video games has allowed us to reinforce our authenticity as well as establish our
brand with broader audiences who may not otherwise be exposed to our advertising and brand efforts. In 2010, we returned to a version of our signature campaign with “Protect this House.

®

I Will.” This campaign focused heavily on the training aspect of sports, which we believe is at the core of today’s athletes’ performance and
improvement.

Retail Marketing and Product Presentation

The primary component of our retail marketing strategy is to increase and brand floor space dedicated to our products within our major retail accounts. The design and funding of Under Armour concept shops
within our major retail accounts has been a key initiative for securing prime floor space, educating the consumer and creating an exciting environment for the consumer to experience our brand. Under Armour concept shops enhance our brand’s
presentation within our major retail accounts with a shop-in-shop approach, using dedicated floor space exclusively for our products, including flooring, lighting, walls, displays and images.

Across our many retailers, factory house and specialty stores we also use in-store fixtures and displays that highlight our logo and have
a performance-oriented, athletic look. We believe our in-store fixtures and displays, including our life-size athlete mannequins, are exciting and unique. These displays provide an easily identifiable place for consumers to look for our products and
are intended to reinforce the message that our brand is distinct from our competitors. We work with our retailers to establish optimal placement for our products and to have the brand represented in the many departments of our large national or
regional retail chains.

Customers

Our products are offered in over twenty three thousand retail stores worldwide, of which nearly sixteen thousand retail stores are in North America. We also sell our products directly to consumers through
our own factory house and specialty stores, website and catalogs.

Wholesale Distribution

In 2010, 73% of our net revenues were generated from wholesale distribution. Our principal customers located in the United States include
national and regional retail chains such as, in alphabetical order, Academy Sports and Outdoors, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Hibbett Sporting Goods, Modell’s Sporting Goods, and The Sports Authority; hunting and fishing, mountain sports and
outdoor retailers such as Bass Pro Shops and Cabela’s; and The Army and Air Force Exchange Service. Our principal customers located in Canada include national retail chains such as Sportchek International and Sportman International. In 2010,
our two largest customers were, in alphabetical order, Dick’s Sporting Goods and The Sports Authority. These two customers accounted for a total of 27% of our net revenues in 2010, and one of these customers individually accounted for at least
10% of our net revenues in 2010.



In 2010, approximately 75% of our wholesale distribution was derived from large format
national and regional retail chains. Additional wholesale distribution in 2010 was derived from independent and specialty retailers, institutional athletic departments, leagues and teams. The independent and specialty retailers are serviced by a
combination of in-house sales personnel and third-party commissioned manufacturer’s representatives and continue to represent an important part of our product distribution strategy and help build on the authenticity of our products. Our
independent sales include sales to military specialists, fitness specialists, outdoor retailers and other specialty channels. With the launch of our footwear, we expanded our distribution at the mall through national footwear retailers including
Finish Line and Foot Locker.

Direct to Consumer Sales

In 2010, 23% of our net revenues were generated through direct to consumer sales. Direct to consumer sales include discounted sales through our own factory house stores and sales through our specialty
stores, global website and catalog. As of December 31, 2010, we had 54 factory house stores, of which the majority are located at outlet centers on the East Coast of the United States. Through our specialty stores, consumers experience our
brand first-hand and have broader access to our performance products. These specialty stores are located near Annapolis, Maryland, Chicago, Illinois, Boston, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C.

Product Licensing

In addition to generating net revenues through wholesale distribution and direct to consumer sales, we generate net revenues from licensing arrangements to manufacture and distribute Under Armour branded
products. In order to maintain consistent quality and performance, we pre-approve all products manufactured and sold by our licensees, and our quality assurance team strives to ensure that the products meet the same quality and compliance standards
as the products that we sell directly. We have relationships with several licensees for socks, team uniforms, eyewear and custom-molded mouth guards, as well as the distribution of our products to college bookstores and golf pro shops. In addition,
we have a relationship with a Japanese licensee that has the exclusive rights to distribute our products in Japan. In 2010, license revenues accounted for 4% of our net revenues. We have developed our own headwear and bags, and beginning in 2011,
these products are being sold by us rather than by one of our licensees.

Net Revenues in Other Foreign Countries

Our net revenues in other foreign countries include net revenues generated in Western Europe, primarily in Austria,
France, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom. In addition, net revenues in other foreign countries include net revenues generated through third-party distributors primarily in Australia, Italy, Greece, New Zealand, Panama, Scandinavia and Spain,
along with license revenues from our licensee in Japan. We believe that the trend toward performance products is global, and we will continue to introduce our products and simple merchandising story to athletes throughout the world. In international
markets, we are introducing our performance apparel, footwear and accessories in a manner consistent with our past brand-building strategy, including selling our products directly to teams and individual athletes in these markets, thereby providing
us with product exposure to broad audiences of potential consumers.

Since 2002, we have had a license agreement with Dome
Corporation, which produces, markets and sells our branded products in Japan. We work closely with this licensee to develop variations of our products for the different sizes, sports interests and preferences of the Japanese consumer. Our branded
products are now sold in Japan to professional sports teams, including Omiya Ardija, a professional soccer club in Saitama, Japan, as well as baseball and other soccer teams, and to over two thousand independent specialty stores and large sporting
goods retailers, such as Alpen, Himaraya, The Sports Authority and Xebio. We made a minority equity investment in Dome Corporation effective January 2011.

In 2006, we opened our European headquarters in Amsterdam, The Netherlands from which our European sales, marketing and logistics functions are conducted. We sell our branded products to Premier League
Football



clubs and multiple running, golf and cricket clubs in the United Kingdom, soccer teams in France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Sweden, as well as First Division Rugby clubs in
France, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for consolidated net revenues for each of the last three years attributed to the United States and to other foreign countries.

We operate in the following geographic segments: North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia. Refer to
Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information on these segments.

Seasonality

Historically, we have recognized a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two
quarters of the year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of our higher priced COLDGEAR

®

line. Historically, a larger portion of our income from operations has been in the last two quarters of the year
partially due to the shift in the timing of marketing investments to the first two quarters of the year. The majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2010, 2009 and 2008. The level of our working capital
generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. We generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season.

Product Design and Development

Our products are manufactured with technical fabrications produced by third parties and developed in collaboration with our product development team. This approach enables us to select and create
superior, technically advanced fabrics, produced to our specifications, while focusing our product development efforts on design, fit, climate and product end use.

We seek to regularly upgrade and improve our products with the latest in innovative technology while broadening our product offerings. Our goal, to deliver superior performance in all our products,
provides our developers and licensees with a clear, overarching direction for the brand and helps them identify new opportunities to create performance products that meet the changing needs of athletes. We design products with “visible
technology,” utilizing color, texture and fabrication to enhance our customers’ perception and understanding of product use and benefits.

Our product development team has significant prior industry experience at leading fabric and other raw material suppliers and branded athletic apparel and footwear companies throughout the world. This
team works closely with our sports marketing and sales teams as well as professional and collegiate athletes to identify product trends and determine market needs. For example, these teams worked closely to identify the opportunity and market for
our Catalyst products, which are the cornerstone of the Under Armour Green Collection. The fabrics of the Catalyst products are made from recycled plastic bottles and, like many of our products, are designed to keep an athlete cool and dry and
protected from the sun’s harmful rays.

Sourcing, Manufacturing and Quality Assurance

Many of the specialty fabrics and other raw materials used in our products are technically advanced products developed by third parties
and may be available, in the short term, from a limited number of sources. The fabric and other raw materials used to manufacture our products are sourced by our manufacturers from a limited number of suppliers pre-approved by us. In 2010,
approximately 70% to 75% of the fabric used in our products came from eight suppliers. These fabric suppliers have locations in El Salvador, Mexico, Peru, Taiwan and the United States. We continue to seek new suppliers and believe, although there
can be no assurance, that this concentration will decrease over time. The fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are primarily synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum based products, that may be subject to price



fluctuations and shortages. Beginning in 2011 we are offering CHARGED COTTON™ products using primarily cotton fabrics that also may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages.

Substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers and, in 2010, six manufacturers produced
approximately 45% of our products. In 2010, our products were manufactured by 26 primary manufacturers, operating in 22 countries. During 2010, approximately 55% of our products were manufactured in Asia, 25% in Central and South America, 10% in
Mexico and 5% in the Middle East. All manufacturers are evaluated for quality systems, social compliance and financial strength by our quality assurance team prior to being selected and on an ongoing basis. Where appropriate, we strive to qualify
multiple manufacturers for particular product types and fabrications. We also seek out vendors that can perform multiple manufacturing stages, such as procuring raw materials and providing finished products, which helps us to control our cost of
goods sold. We enter into a variety of agreements with our manufacturers, including non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to a code of conduct regarding quality of manufacturing and
working conditions and other social concerns. We do not, however, have any long term agreements requiring us to utilize any manufacturer, and no manufacturer is required to produce our products in the long term. We have an office in Hong Kong to
support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for apparel and offices in Guangzhou, China to support our manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts for footwear.

We also manufacture a limited number of apparel products on-premises in our quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop located at one of our
distribution facilities in Maryland. Through this 17,000 square-foot shop, we are able to build and ship apparel products on tight deadlines for high-profile athletes, leagues and teams. While the apparel products manufactured in the quick turn,
Special Make-Up Shop represent an immaterial portion of our total net revenues, we believe the facility helps us to provide superior service to select customers.

Distribution and Inventory Management

We
package and distribute the majority of our products through two distribution facilities located approximately 15 miles from our Baltimore, Maryland headquarters. One facility is a high-bay facility built in 2000, in which we currently lease and
occupy approximately 359,000 square feet. The lease term expires in September 2011, with two options to extend the lease term for up to four years in total. The other facility is a high-bay facility built in 2003, in which we lease and occupy
approximately 308,000 square feet. The lease term expires in April 2013, with one option to extend the lease term for an additional five years. In addition, we distribute our products in North America through a third-party logistics provider with
primary locations in California and in Florida. The agreement with this provider continues until December 2012. In 2010, we began to distribute some of our international products through a third-party logistics provider in Hong Kong. We also
distribute our products in Europe through a third-party logistics provider based out of Venlo, The Netherlands. This agreement continues until April 2013. We believe our distribution facilities and space available at our third-party logistics
providers will be adequate to meet our short term needs. We expect to expand to additional facilities in the future.

Inventory management is important to the financial condition and operating results of our business. We manage our inventory levels based
on any existing orders, anticipated sales and the rapid-delivery requirements of our customers. Our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory efficiency over the long term by putting systems
and procedures in place to improve our inventory management. We expect to achieve this by being in stock in core product offerings, which includes products that we plan to have available for sale over the next twelve months and beyond at full price.
In addition, we expect to achieve our inventory strategy by ordering our seasonal products based on current bookings, shipping seasonal product at the start of the shipping window in order to maximize the productivity of floor space at our retailers
and earmarking any seasonal excess for sales through our factory house stores and liquidation sales to third parties.



Our practice, and the general practice in the apparel and footwear industries, is to offer
retail customers the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise. Because of long lead-times for design and production of our products, from time to time we commence production of new products before receiving orders for those
products. This affects our inventory levels for new products.

Intellectual Property

We believe we own the internally developed material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and
sale of all our products, both domestically and internationally, where our products are currently sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include the UA Logo and UNDER ARMOUR

®

, both of which are registered in the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan and several other foreign countries in which we sell or plan to sell our
products. We also own trademark registrations for UA

, and for other of our trademarks. In addition, we have applied to register numerous other trademarks including:
CHARGED COTTON™, GAMEDAY ARMOUR™, and MICRO G™. We also own internally developed domain names for our primary trademarks and hold copyright registrations for several commercials, as well as for certain artwork. We intend to continue
to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks and copyrights we utilize today and those we develop in the future. We will continue to aggressively police our trademarks and pursue those who infringe, both domestically
and internationally.

We believe the distinctive trademarks we use in connection with our products are important in building
our brand image and distinguishing our products from those of others. These trademarks are among our most valuable assets. In addition to our distinctive trademarks, we also place significant value on our trade dress, which is the overall image and
appearance of our products, and we believe our trade dress helps to distinguish our products in the marketplace.

The
intellectual property rights in much of the technology, materials and processes used to manufacture our products are often owned or controlled by our suppliers. However, we seek to protect certain innovative products and features that we believe to
be new, strategic and important to our business. In 2010, we filed several patent applications in connection with certain of our products and designs that we believe offer a unique utility or function. We will continue to file patent applications
where we deem appropriate to protect our inventions and designs, and we expect the number of applications to grow as our business grows and as we continue to innovate in a range of product categories.

Competition

The market for performance athletic apparel and footwear is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and
marketing of performance products. The fabrics and technology used in manufacturing our products are generally not unique to us, and we do not currently own any fabric or process patents. Many of our competitors are large apparel, footwear and
sporting goods companies with strong worldwide brand recognition and significantly greater resources than us, such as Nike and adidas. We also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel, and private label
offerings of certain retailers, including some of our customers.

In addition, we must compete with others for purchasing
decisions, as well as limited floor space at retailers. We believe we have been successful in this area because of the relationships we have developed and as a result of the strong sales of our products. However, if retailers earn greater margins
from our competitors’ products, they may favor the display and sale of those products.

We believe we have been able to
compete successfully because of our brand image and recognition, the performance and quality of our products and our selective distribution policies. We also believe our focused



gearline merchandising story differentiates us from our competition. In the future we expect to compete for consumer preferences and expect that we may face greater competition on pricing. This
may favor larger competitors with lower costs per unit of product produced that can spread the effect of price discounts across a larger array of products and across a larger customer base than ours. The purchasing decisions of consumers for our
products often reflect highly subjective preferences that can be influenced by many factors, including advertising, media, product sponsorships, product improvements and changing styles.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we had
approximately thirty nine hundred employees, including approximately twenty two hundred in our factory house and specialty stores and six hundred at our distribution facilities. Approximately two thousand of our employees were full-time. Most of our
employees are located in the United States and none of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related work stoppages, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

We will make available free of charge on or through our website at www.underarmour.com our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these

ITEM 1A.    RISK

FACTORS

Forward-Looking Statements

Some of the statements contained in this Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference constitute
forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts, such as
statements regarding our future financial condition or results of operations, our prospects and strategies for future growth, the development and introduction of new products, and the implementation of our marketing and branding strategies. In many
cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expects,” “plans,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,”
“predicts,” “outlook,” “potential” or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.

The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by reference reflect our current views about future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties,
assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause events or our actual activities or results to differ significantly from those expressed in any forward-looking statement. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the
forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future events, results, actions, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. A number of
important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those factors described in “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” These factors include without limitation:

•

changes in general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers;

•

our ability to effectively manage our growth and a more complex business;

•

our ability to effectively develop and launch new, innovative and updated products;

•

our ability to accurately forecast consumer demand for our products and manage our inventory in response to changing demands;

•

increased competition causing us to reduce the prices of our products or to increase significantly our marketing efforts in order to avoid losing
market share;

•

fluctuations in the costs of our products;

•

loss of key suppliers or manufacturers or failure of our suppliers or manufacturers to produce or deliver our products in a timely or cost-effective
manner;

•

changes in consumer preferences or the reduction in demand for performance apparel, footwear and other products;

•

our ability to accurately anticipate and respond to seasonal or quarterly fluctuations in our operating results;

•

our ability to effectively market and maintain a positive brand image;

•

the availability, integration and effective operation of management information systems and other technology; and

•

our ability to attract and maintain the services of our senior management and key employees.

The forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K reflect our views and assumptions only as of the date of this Form 10-K. We
undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.



Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by
numerous risks. You should carefully consider the risk factors detailed below in conjunction with the other information contained in this Form 10-K. Should any of these risks actually materialize, our business, financial condition and future
prospects could be negatively impacted.

During a downturn in the economy, consumer purchases of discretionary items are affected,
which could materially harm our sales, profitability and financial condition.

Many of our products may be considered
discretionary items for consumers. Factors affecting the level of consumer spending for such discretionary items include general economic conditions, the availability of consumer credit and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. Consumer
purchases of discretionary items tend to decline during recessionary periods when disposable income is lower. We have limited experience operating a business during a recessionary period and can therefore not predict the full impact of a downturn in
the economy on our sales and profitability, including how our business responds when the economy is recovering from a recession. A downturn in the economy in markets in which we sell our products may materially harm our sales, profitability and
financial condition.

If the financial condition of our retail customers declines, our financial condition and results of operations could
be adversely impacted.

We extend credit to our customers based on an assessment of a customer’s financial condition,
generally without requiring collateral. We face increased risk of order reduction or cancellation when dealing with financially ailing customers or customers struggling with economic uncertainty. A slowing economy in our key markets or a continued
decline in consumer purchases of sporting goods generally could have an adverse effect on the financial health of our retail customers, which could in turn have an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial
condition.

A decline in sales to, or the loss of, one or more of our key customers could result in a material loss of net revenues and
negatively impact our prospects for growth.

In 2010, approximately 27% of our net revenues were generated from sales to
our two largest customers in alphabetical order, Dick’s Sporting Goods and The Sports Authority. We currently do not enter into long term sales contracts with these or our other key customers, relying instead on our relationships with these
customers and on our position in the marketplace. As a result, we face the risk that one or more of these key customers may not increase their business with us as we expect, or may significantly decrease their business with us or terminate their
relationship with us. The failure to increase our sales to these customers as we anticipate would have a negative impact on our growth prospects and any decrease or loss of these key customers’ business could result in a material decrease in
our net revenues and net income.

If we continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may not be able to effectively manage our growth and the
increased complexity of our business and as a result our brand image, net revenues and profitability may decline.

We have
expanded our operations rapidly since our inception and our net revenues have increased to $1,063.9 million in 2010 from $430.7 million in 2006. If our operations continue to grow at a rapid pace, we may experience difficulties in obtaining
sufficient raw materials and manufacturing capacity to produce our products, as well as delays in production and shipments, as our products are subject to risks associated with overseas sourcing and manufacturing. We could be required to continue to
expand our sales and marketing, product development and distribution functions, to upgrade our management information systems and other processes and technology, and to obtain more space to support our expanding workforce. This expansion could
increase the strain on these and other resources, and we could experience serious operating difficulties, including difficulties



in hiring, training and managing an increasing number of employees. In addition, as our business becomes more complex through the introduction of more new products, such as new footwear, and the
expansion of our distribution channels, including additional specialty and factory house stores, and expanded international distribution, these operational strains and other difficulties could increase. These difficulties could result in the erosion
of our brand image and a decrease in net revenues and net income.

If we are unable to anticipate consumer preferences and successfully
develop and introduce new, innovative and updated products, we may not be able to maintain or increase our net revenues and profitability.

Our success depends on our ability to identify and originate product trends as well as to anticipate and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner. All of our products are subject to changing
consumer preferences that cannot be predicted with certainty. Our new products may not receive consumer acceptance as consumer preferences could shift rapidly to different types of performance or other sports products or away from these types of
products altogether, and our future success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these changes. Failure to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing consumer preferences could lead to, among other things, lower
sales and excess inventory levels.

Even if we are successful in anticipating consumer preferences, our ability to adequately
react to and address those preferences will in part depend upon our continued ability to develop and introduce innovative, high-quality products. The failure to effectively introduce new products and enter into new product categories that are
accepted by consumers could result in a decrease in net revenues and excess inventory levels, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.

Our results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.

To ensure adequate inventory supply, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our manufacturers before firm orders are placed by our customers. In addition, a significant portion of our net
revenues are generated by at-once orders for immediate delivery to customers, particularly during our historical peak season from August through November. If we fail to accurately forecast customer demand we may experience excess inventory levels or
a shortage of product to deliver to our customers.

Factors that could affect our ability to accurately forecast demand for
our products include:

•

an increase or decrease in consumer demand for our products;

•

our failure to accurately forecast consumer acceptance for our new products;

•

product introductions by competitors;

•

unanticipated changes in general market conditions or other factors, which may result in cancellations of advance orders or a reduction or increase in
the rate of reorders placed by retailers;

•

weakening of economic conditions or consumer confidence in future economic conditions, which could reduce demand for discretionary items, such as our
products; and

•

terrorism or acts of war, or the threat thereof, or political instability or unrest which could adversely affect consumer confidence and spending or
interrupt production and distribution of product and raw materials.

Inventory levels in excess of customer
demand may result in inventory write-downs or write-offs and the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices, which would have an adverse effect on gross margin. In addition, if we underestimate the demand for our products, our manufacturers may
not be able to produce products to meet our customer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of our products and our ability to recognize revenue, as well as damage to our reputation and customer relationships.



The difficulty in forecasting demand also makes it difficult to estimate our future results
of operations and financial condition from period to period. A failure to accurately predict the level of demand for our products could adversely impact our profitability.

Our revolving credit facility provides our lenders with a first-priority lien against substantially all of our assets and contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions, and it
could therefore limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition.

We have, from time
to time, financed our liquidity needs in part from borrowings made under a revolving credit facility. Our revolving credit facility provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to $200.0 million (based on the value of our qualified
domestic accounts receivable and inventory).

The agreement for our revolving credit facility contains a number of
restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, to:

•

use our accounts receivable, inventory, trademarks and most of our other assets as security in other borrowings or transactions;

•

incur additional indebtedness;

•

sell certain assets;

•

make certain investments;

•

guarantee certain obligations of third parties;

•

undergo a merger or consolidation; and

•

materially change our line of business.

Our revolving credit facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base, even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the revolving credit facility, upon a material
adverse change to our business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we must maintain a certain leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. Failure to comply with these
operating or financial covenants could result from, among other things, changes in our results of operations or general economic conditions. These covenants may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that would otherwise be in our best
interests. Failure to comply with any of the covenants under the credit agreement could result in a default. This could cause the lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and exercise their lien on essentially all of our assets, which would have
a material adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, because borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at variable interest rates, which we do not anticipate hedging against,
increases in interest rates would increase our cost of borrowing, resulting in a decline in our net income and cash flow. There were no amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2010.

We may need to raise additional capital required to grow our business, and we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all.

Growing and operating our business will require significant cash outlays and capital expenditures and commitments. If cash
on hand and cash generated from operations are not sufficient to meet our cash requirements, we will need to seek additional capital, potentially through debt or equity financings, to fund our growth. We may not be able to raise needed cash on terms
acceptable to us or at all. Financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders, and the prices at which new investors would be willing to purchase our securities may be lower than the current price per share of
our common stock. The holders of new securities may also have rights, preferences or privileges which are senior to those of existing holders of common stock. If new sources of financing are required, but are insufficient or unavailable, we will be



required to modify our growth and operating plans based on available funding, if any, which would harm our ability to grow our business.

We operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, resulting in a loss of our market share and a
decrease in our net revenues and gross profit.

The market for performance athletic apparel and footwear is highly
competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. Because we currently do not own any fabric or process patents, our current
and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. Many of our competitors are large apparel and footwear companies with strong worldwide brand recognition.
Because of the fragmented nature of the industry, we also compete with other manufacturers, including those specializing in outdoor apparel and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our retail customers. Many of our
competitors have significant competitive advantages, including greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, longer operating histories, better brand recognition among consumers, and greater economies of scale. In addition, our
competitors have long term relationships with our key retail customers that are potentially more important to those customers because of the significantly larger volume and product mix that our competitors sell to them. As a result, these
competitors may be better equipped than we are to influence consumer preferences or otherwise increase their market share by:

•

quickly adapting to changes in customer requirements;

•

readily taking advantage of acquisition and other opportunities;

•

discounting excess inventory that has been written down or written off;

•

devoting resources to the marketing and sale of their products, including significant advertising, media placement and product endorsement;

•

adopting aggressive pricing policies; and

•

engaging in lengthy and costly intellectual property and other disputes.

In addition, while one of our growth strategies is to increase floor space for our products in retail stores, retailers have limited
resources and floor space and we must compete with others to develop relationships with them. Increased competition by existing and future competitors could result in reductions in floor space in retail locations, reductions in sales or reductions
in the prices of our products, and if retailers earn greater margins from our competitors’ products, they may favor the display and sale of those products. Our inability to compete successfully against our competitors and maintain our gross
margin could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our profitability may decline
as a result of increasing pressure on margins.

Our industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many
factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products and changes in consumer demand. These factors may cause us to reduce our prices to retailers and consumers, which
could cause our profitability to decline if we are unable to offset price reductions with comparable reductions in our operating costs. This could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Fluctuations in the cost of products could negatively affect our operating results.

The fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are made of raw materials including petroleum-based products and, beginning in 2011,
cotton. Significant price fluctuations or shortages in petroleum or other raw materials can materially adversely affect our cost of goods sold, results of operations and financial condition.



We rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers to provide fabrics for and to produce our products,
and we have limited control over these suppliers and manufacturers and may not be able to obtain quality products on a timely basis or in sufficient quantity.

Many of the specialty fabrics used in our products are technically advanced textile products developed by third parties and may be available, in the short-term, from a very limited number of sources.
Substantially all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers, and, in 2010, six manufacturers produced approximately 45% of our products. We have no long term contracts with our suppliers or manufacturing sources, and we compete
with other companies for fabrics, raw materials, production and import quota capacity.

We may experience a significant
disruption in the supply of fabrics or raw materials from current sources or, in the event of a disruption, we may be unable to locate alternative materials suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all. In addition, our
unaffiliated manufacturers may not be able to fill our orders in a timely manner. If we experience significant increased demand, or we lose or need to replace an existing manufacturer or supplier as a result of adverse economic conditions or other
reasons, additional supplies of fabrics or raw materials or additional manufacturing capacity may not be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or suppliers or manufacturers may not be able to allocate sufficient
capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, even if we are able to expand existing or find new manufacturing or fabric sources, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our
suppliers and manufacturers in our methods, products and quality control standards. Any delays, interruption or increased costs in the supply of fabric or manufacture of our products could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet retail
customer and consumer demand for our products and result in lower net revenues and net income both in the short and long term.

We have occasionally received, and may in the future continue to receive, shipments of product that fail to conform to our quality
control standards. In that event, unless we are able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk the loss of net revenues resulting from the inability to sell those products and related increased administrative and shipping costs. In
addition, because we do not control our manufacturers, products that fail to meet our standards or other unauthorized products could end up in the marketplace without our knowledge, which could harm our brand and our reputation in the marketplace.

Labor disruptions at ports or our suppliers or manufacturers may adversely affect our business.

Our business depends on our ability to source and distribute products in a timely manner. As a result, we rely on the free flow of goods
through open and operational ports worldwide and on a consistent basis from our suppliers and manufacturers. Labor disputes at various ports, such as those experienced at western U.S. ports in 2002, or at our suppliers or manufacturers, create
significant risks for our business, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions during our peak importing or manufacturing seasons, and could have an adverse effect on our business, potentially
resulting in cancelled orders by customers, unanticipated inventory accumulation or shortages and reduced net revenues and net income.

Our
international operations and the operations of many of our manufacturers are subject to additional risks that are beyond our control and that could harm our business.

In 2010, our apparel and footwear were manufactured by 26 primary manufacturers, operating in 22 countries. Of these, six manufactured approximately 45% of our products, at locations in Honduras, Jordan,
Malaysia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam. In 2010, approximately 55% of our products were manufactured in Asia, 25% in Central and South America, 10% in Mexico and 5% in the Middle East. In addition, approximately 6% of our 2010
net revenues were generated through sales and licensing fees in other foreign countries. As a result of our international manufacturing and sales, we are subject to risks associated with doing business abroad, including:

•

political unrest, terrorism and economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries in which our products are
manufactured;



•

currency exchange fluctuations;

•

the imposition of new laws and regulations, including those relating to labor conditions, quality and safety standards, imports, duties, taxes and
other charges on imports, trade restrictions and restrictions on the transfer of funds, as well as rules and regulations regarding climate change;

•

reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;

•

understanding foreign consumer tastes and preferences that may differ from those in the United States;

•

complying with foreign laws and regulations that differ from country to country;

•

disruptions or delays in shipments; and

•

changes in local economic conditions in countries where our manufacturers, suppliers or customers are located.

Sales of performance athletic products may not continue to grow and this could adversely impact our ability to grow our business.

We believe continued growth in industry-wide sales of performance athletic products will be largely dependent on consumers continuing to
transition from traditional alternatives to performance athletic products. If consumers are not convinced these athletic products are a better choice than traditional alternatives, growth in the industry and our business could be adversely affected.
In addition, because performance athletic products are often more expensive than traditional alternatives, consumers who are convinced these athletic products provide a better alternative may still not be convinced they are worth the extra cost. If
industry-wide sales of performance athletic products do not grow, our ability to continue to grow our business and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely impacted.

Our operating results are subject to seasonal and quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income, which could adversely affect the price of
our Class A Common Stock.

We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, seasonal and
quarterly variations in our net revenues and net income. These variations are primarily related to increased sales of our products during the fall season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of sales of our higher
priced COLDGEAR

®

line. The majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of
2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly
as a result of a variety of other factors, including, among other things, the timing and introduction of advertising for new products and changes in our product mix. Variations in weather conditions may also have an adverse effect on our quarterly
results of operations. For example, warmer than normal weather conditions throughout the fall or winter may reduce sales of our COLDGEAR

®

line, leaving us with excess inventory and operating results below our expectations.

As a result of these seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, we believe that comparisons of our operating results between different quarters within a single year are not necessarily meaningful and that these
comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance. Any seasonal or quarterly fluctuations that we report in the future may not match the expectations of market analysts and investors. This could cause the price of our
Class A Common Stock to fluctuate significantly.

The value of our brand and sales of our products could be diminished if we are
associated with negative publicity.

We require our suppliers, independent manufacturers and licensees of our products to
operate their businesses in compliance with the laws and regulations that apply to them as well as the social and other



standards and policies we impose on them. We do not control these suppliers, manufacturers or licensees or their labor practices. A violation of our policies, labor laws or other laws by our
suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could interrupt or otherwise disrupt our sourcing or damage our brand image. Negative publicity regarding the production methods of any of our suppliers, manufacturers or licensees could adversely affect our
reputation and sales and force us to locate alternative suppliers, manufacturing sources or licensees.

In addition, we have
sponsorship contracts with a variety of athletes and feature those athletes in our advertising and marketing efforts, and many athletes and teams use our products, including those teams or leagues for which we are an official supplier. Actions taken
by athletes, teams or leagues associated with our products could harm the reputations of those athletes, teams or leagues. As a result, our brand image, net revenues and profitability could be adversely affected.

Sponsorships and designations as an official supplier may become more expensive and this could impact the value of our brand image.

A key element of our marketing strategy has been to create a link in the consumer market between our products and professional and
collegiate athletes. We previously gained significant publicity and brand name recognition from the perceived sponsorships associated with professional and collegiate athletes and sports programs using our products. The use of our products by
athletes and teams was frequently without our paying compensation or in exchange for our furnishing product at a reduced cost or without charge and without formal arrangements. We also have licensing agreements to be the official supplier of
performance apparel and footwear to a variety of sports teams and leagues at the collegiate and professional level as well as Olympic teams. However, as competition in the performance apparel and footwear industry has increased, the costs associated
with athlete sponsorships and official supplier licensing agreements have increased, including the costs associated with obtaining and retaining these sponsorships and agreements. If we are unable to maintain our current association with
professional and collegiate athletes, teams and leagues, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the on-field authenticity associated with our products, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments.
As a result, our brand image, net revenues, expenses and profitability could be materially adversely affected.

If we encounter problems
with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market could be adversely affected.

We rely on
our two distribution facilities in Glen Burnie, Maryland for the majority of our product distribution. Our distribution facilities utilize computer controlled and automated equipment, which means the operations are complicated and may be subject to
a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. In addition, because the majority of our products are distributed from two nearby locations, our
operations could also be interrupted by floods, fires or other natural disasters near our distribution facilities, as well as labor difficulties. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect us from the adverse
effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in our distribution facilities, such as the long term loss of customers or an erosion of our brand image. In addition, our distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of
services by third parties, including the shipping of product to and from our distribution facilities. If we encounter problems with our distribution facilities, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve
objectives for operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.

We rely significantly on information technology and any
failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate our business.

Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our inventory and internal reports, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis depends significantly on our enterprise resource
planning, warehouse management, and other information systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively or to



integrate with other systems, or a breach in security of these systems could cause delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and it could require significant capital
investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach.

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of
our senior management and other key employees.

Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of
our senior management and other key employees, particularly Kevin A. Plank, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. The loss of the services of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully
operate our business and achieve our business goals.

We also may be unable to retain existing management, product creation,
sales, marketing, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated recruitment and training costs.

If we are unable to attract and retain new team members, including senior management, we may not be able to achieve our business
objectives.

Our growth has largely been the result of significant contributions by our current senior management, product
design teams and other key employees. However, to be successful in continuing to grow our business, we will need to continue to attract, retain and motivate highly talented management and other employees with a range of skills and experience.
Competition for employees in our industry is intense and we have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future. If we
are unable to attract, assimilate and retain management and other employees with the necessary skills, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business.

Our failure to comply with trade and other regulations could lead to investigations or actions by government regulators and negative publicity.

The labeling, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal
agencies, including the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Product Safety Commission and state attorneys general in the U.S., as well as by various other federal, state, provincial, local and international regulatory authorities in the locations in
which our products are distributed or sold. If we fail to comply with those regulations, we could become subject to significant penalties or claims, which could harm our results of operations or our ability to conduct our business. In addition, the
adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretation of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may impair the marketing of our products, resulting in significant loss of net
revenues.

Our President and Chief Executive Officer controls the majority of the voting power of our common stock.

Our Class A Common Stock has one vote per share and our Class B Convertible Common Stock has 10 votes per share. Our President
and Chief Executive Officer, Kevin A. Plank, beneficially owns all outstanding shares of Class B Convertible Common Stock. As a result, Mr. Plank has the majority voting control and is able to direct the election of all of the members of our
Board of Directors and other matters we submit to a vote of our stockholders. This concentration of ownership may have various effects including, but not limited to, delaying or preventing a change of control.

Our fabrics and manufacturing technology are not patented and can be imitated by our competitors.

The intellectual property rights in the technology, fabrics and processes used to manufacture our products are generally owned or
controlled by our suppliers and are generally not unique to us. Our ability to obtain patent



protection for our products is limited and we currently own no fabric or process patents. As a result, our current and future competitors are able to manufacture and sell products with
performance characteristics and fabrications similar to our products. Because many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do, they may be able to manufacture and sell products
based on our fabrics and manufacturing technology at lower prices than we can. If our competitors do sell similar products to ours at lower prices, our net revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.

Our trademark and other proprietary rights could potentially conflict with the rights of others and we may be prevented from selling some of our
products.

Our success depends in large part on our brand image. We believe our registered and common law trademarks have
significant value and are important to identifying and differentiating our products from those of our competitors and creating and sustaining demand for our products. There may be obstacles that arise as we expand our product line and geographic
scope of our marketing. From time to time, we have received claims relating to intellectual property rights of others, and we expect third parties will continue to assert intellectual property claims against us, particularly as we expand our
business and the number of products we offer. Any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability or prevent us from selling
some of our products. In addition, resolution of claims may require us to redesign our products, license rights belonging to third parties or cease using those rights altogether. Any of these events could harm our business and have a material
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could
diminish the value of our brand, weaken our competitive position and reduce our net revenues.

We currently rely on a
combination of copyright, trademark and trade dress laws, patent laws, unfair competition laws, confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. The steps taken by us to protect our
proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent infringement of our trademarks and proprietary rights by others, including imitation of our products and misappropriation of our brand. In addition, intellectual property protection may be
unavailable or limited in some foreign countries where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States, and it may be more difficult for us to successfully challenge the use of our
proprietary rights by other parties in these countries. If we fail to protect and maintain our intellectual property rights, the value of our brand could be diminished and our competitive position may suffer.

From time to time, we discover unauthorized products in the marketplace that are either counterfeit reproductions of our products or
unauthorized irregulars that do not meet our quality control standards. If we are unsuccessful in challenging a third party’s products on the basis of trademark infringement, continued sales of their products could adversely impact our brand,
result in the shift of consumer preferences away from our products and adversely affect our business.

We have licensed in the
past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to third parties. These licensees may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or harm our reputation.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

Not applicable.



ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our principal executive
and administrative offices are located at an office complex in Baltimore, Maryland. We believe that our current location will be sufficient for the operation of our business over the next twelve months. We have two primary distribution facilities in
Glen Burnie, Maryland. We believe our distribution facilities and space available through our third-party logistics providers will be adequate to meet our short term needs. We expect to expand to additional distribution facilities in the future.

The location, general use, approximate size and lease term of our properties as of December 31, 2010, none of which is
currently owned by us, are set forth below:

(1)

Includes various lease obligations with options to renew beginning February 2012 through October 2015.

(2)

Includes a 359,000 square foot facility with an option to renew in September 2011 and a 308,000 square foot facility with an option to renew in May 2013.

(3)

Includes fifty seven factory house and specialty stores located in the United States with lease end dates of April 2011 through July 2020. We also have an additional
factory house store which is included in the Glen Burnie, Maryland location in the table above. Excluded in the table above are executed lease agreements for factory house stores that we did not yet occupy as of December 31, 2010. We anticipate
that we will be able to extend these leases that expire in the near future on satisfactory terms or relocate to other locations.

In November 2010 we entered into an agreement to purchase 400,000 square feet of office space at our current office complex. Subject to certain conditions, we expect the transaction to close in early
2011. As of February 2011, we lease approximately 170,000 square feet of the available space in this part of the complex, and we anticipate taking additional space over time.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

From time to time, we have been involved in various legal proceedings. We believe all such litigation is routine in nature and incidental to the conduct of our business, and we believe no such litigation
will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

The information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes
and the information contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K under the captions “Risk Factors,” “Selected Financial Data,” and “Business.”

Overview

We are a leading developer, marketer and distributor of branded
performance apparel, footwear and accessories. The brand’s moisture-wicking fabrications are engineered in many different designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. Our
products are sold



worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional, on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles.

Our net revenues grew to $1,063.9 million in 2010 from $430.7 million in 2006. We believe that our growth in net revenues has been driven
by a growing interest in performance products and the strength of the Under Armour brand in the marketplace relative to our competitors, as evidenced by the increases in our sales of our products. We plan to continue to increase our net revenues
over the long term by increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets. Our direct to consumer sales channel
includes sales through our factory house and specialty stores, website, and catalog. New product offerings for 2010 included basketball footwear which had a limited introduction in the United States and Canada.

Our products are currently offered in over twenty three thousand retail stores worldwide. A large majority of our products are sold in
North America; however we believe our products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. Internationally, our products are offered primarily in Austria, France, Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom, as well as in
Japan through a third-party licensee, and through distributors located in other foreign countries.

We believe there is an
increasing recognition of the health benefits of an active lifestyle. We believe this trend provides us with an expanding consumer base for our products. We also believe there is a continuing shift in consumer demand from traditional non-performance
products to our performance products, which are intended to provide better performance by wicking perspiration away from the skin, helping to regulate body temperature and enhancing comfort. We believe that these shifts in consumer preferences and
lifestyles are not unique to the United States, but are occurring in a number of markets globally, thereby increasing our opportunities to introduce our performance products to new consumers.

Although we believe these trends will facilitate our growth, we also face potential challenges that could limit our ability to take
advantage of these opportunities, including, among others, the risk of general economic or market conditions that could affect consumer spending and the financial health of our retail customers. In addition, we may not be able to effectively manage
our growth and a more complex business. We may not consistently be able to anticipate consumer preferences and develop new and innovative products in a timely manner that meets changing preferences. Furthermore, our industry is very competitive, and
competition pressures could cause us to reduce the prices of our products or otherwise affect our profitability. We also rely on third-party suppliers and manufacturers outside the U.S. to provide fabrics and to produce our products, and disruptions
to our supply chain could harm our business. For a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, refer to “Risk Factors.”

General

Net revenues comprise both net sales and license revenues. Net
sales comprise sales from our primary product categories, which are apparel, footwear and accessories. Our license revenues consist of fees paid to us by our licensees in exchange for the use of our trademarks on core products of socks, headwear,
bags, eyewear, custom-molded mouth guards, other accessories and team uniforms, as well as the distribution of our products in Japan. We have developed our own headwear and bags, and beginning in 2011, these products are being sold by us rather than
by one of our licensees. We expect our net revenues to increase by approximately $60 million from 2010 to 2011 as a result of this change, which includes an increase in accessories revenues and a decrease in our license revenues in 2011. In
addition we expect the related cost of goods sold to increase.

Cost of goods sold consists primarily of product costs,
inbound freight and duty costs, outbound freight costs, handling costs to make products floor-ready to customer specifications, royalty payments to endorsers based on a predetermined percentage of sales of selected products and write downs for
inventory obsolescence. The fabrics in many of our products are made of petroleum-based synthetic materials. Therefore our product



costs, as well as our inbound and outbound freight costs, could be affected by long term pricing trends of oil. In general, as a percentage of net revenues, we expect cost of goods sold
associated with our footwear to be higher than the cost of goods sold associated with our apparel. No cost of goods sold is associated with license revenues.

We include outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as cost of goods sold; however, we include the majority of outbound handling costs as a component of selling, general and
administrative expenses. As a result, our gross profit may not be comparable to that of other companies that include outbound handling costs in their cost of goods sold. Outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship
to customers and certain costs to operate our distribution facilities. These costs were $14.7 million, $12.2 million and $10.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of costs related to marketing, selling, product innovation and supply chain and
corporate services. Personnel costs are included in these categories based on the employees’ function. Personnel costs include salaries, benefits and incentive and stock-based compensation expense related to the employee. Our marketing costs
are an important driver of our growth. Marketing costs consist primarily of commercials, print ads, league, team, player and event sponsorships, amortization of footwear promotional rights and depreciation expense specific to our in-store fixture
program. In addition, marketing costs include costs associated with our Special Make-Up Shop (“SMU Shop”) located at one of our distribution facilities where we manufacture a limited number of products primarily for our league, team,
player and event sponsorships. Selling costs consist primarily of costs relating to sales through our wholesale channel, the majority of our direct to consumer sales channel costs, along with commissions paid to third parties. Product innovation and
supply chain costs include our apparel, footwear and accessories product innovation, sourcing and development costs, distribution facility operating costs, and costs relating to our Hong Kong and Guangzhou, China offices which help support
manufacturing, quality assurance and sourcing efforts. Corporate services primarily consist of corporate facility operating costs and company-wide administrative expenses.

Other expense, net consists of unrealized and realized gains and losses on our derivative financial instruments and unrealized and realized gains and losses on adjustments that arise from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions generated by our international subsidiaries.

Reclassifications

Outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods of $9.2 million and $7.0 million included in selling, general and administrative
expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were reclassified to cost of goods sold to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, costs of $6.3 million and $5.1 million
associated with our sourcing offices and SMU Shop included in cost of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were reclassified to selling, general and administrative expenses to conform to the presentation for
the year ended December 31, 2010. We believe these changes were appropriate given our view that cost of goods sold should primarily include product costs which are variable in nature. In addition, these reclassifications more closely align with
the way we manage our business.



Results of Operations

The following table sets forth key components of our results of operations for the periods indicated, both in dollars and as a percentage of net revenues:

Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009

Net revenues

increased $207.5 million, or 24.2%, to $1,063.9 million in 2010 from $856.4 million in 2009.

Net revenues by geographic region

are summarized below:

Net revenues in North America increased $189.8 million to $997.8 million in 2010 from $808.0 million in 2009
primarily due to increased net sales in apparel as discussed below. Net revenues in other foreign countries increased by $17.7 million to $66.1 million in 2010 from $48.4 million in 2009 primarily due to increased apparel sales in our Europe, Middle
East and Africa (“EMEA”) operating segment and increased product distribution by our licensee in Japan.



Net revenues by product category

are summarized below:

Net sales

increased $201.5 million, or 24.5%, to $1,024.6 million in 2010 from $823.1 million in
2009 as noted in the table above. The increase in net sales primarily reflects:

•

$88.9 million, or 56.8%, increase in direct to consumer sales, which includes 19 additional stores in 2010; and

•

unit growth driven by increased distribution and new offerings in multiple product categories, most significantly in our training, base layer,
mountain, golf and underwear categories; partially offset by

•

$9.0 million decrease in footwear sales driven primarily by a decline in running and training footwear sales.

License revenues

increased $6.1 million, or 18.1%, to $39.4 million in 2010 from $33.3 million in 2009. This increase in license
revenues was primarily a result of increased sales by our licensees due to increased distribution and continued unit volume growth. We have developed our own headwear and bags, and beginning in 2011, these products are being sold by us rather than
by one of our licensees.

Gross profit

increased $120.4 million to $530.5 million in 2010 from $410.1 million in
2009. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, increased 200 basis points to 49.9% in 2010 compared to 47.9% in 2009. The increase in gross margin percentage was primarily driven by the following:

•

increased direct to consumer higher margin sales, accounting for an approximate 100 basis point increase;

•

decreased sales markdowns and returns, primarily due to improved sell-through rates at retail, accounting for an approximate 50 basis point increase;
and

•

decreased inventory reserves, partially offset by increased lower margin third party liquidation sales, accounting for an approximate 50 basis point
increase.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased $93.3 million to $418.2 million in
2010 from $324.9 million in 2009. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 39.3% in 2010 from 37.9% in 2009. These changes were primarily attributable to the following:

•

Marketing costs increased $19.3 million to $128.2 million in 2010 from $108.9 million in 2009 primarily due to an increase in sponsorship of events and
collegiate and professional teams and athletes, increased television and digital campaign costs, including media campaigns for specific customers and additional personnel costs. In addition, we incurred increased expenses for our performance
incentive plan as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of net revenues, marketing costs decreased to 12.0% in 2010 from 12.7% in 2009 primarily due to decreased marketing costs for specific customers.

•

Selling costs increased $25.0 million to $94.6 million in 2010 from $69.6 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher personnel and
other costs incurred for the continued expansion of



our direct to consumer distribution channel and higher selling personnel costs, including increased expenses for our performance incentive plan as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of
net revenues, selling costs increased to 8.9% in 2010 from 8.1% in 2009 primarily due to higher personnel and other costs incurred for the continued expansion of our factory house stores.

•

Product innovation and supply chain costs increased $25.0 million to $96.8 million in 2010 from $71.8 million in 2009 primarily due to higher personnel
costs for the design and sourcing of our expanding apparel, footwear and accessories lines and higher distribution facilities operating and personnel costs as compared to the prior year to support our growth in net revenues. In addition, we incurred
higher expenses for our performance incentive plan as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of net revenues, product innovation and supply chain costs increased to 9.1% in 2010 from 8.4% in 2009 primarily due to the items noted above.

•

Corporate services costs increased $24.0 million to $98.6 million in 2010 from $74.6 million in 2009. This increase was attributable primarily to
higher corporate facility costs, information technology initiatives and corporate personnel costs, including increased expenses for our performance incentive plan as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of net revenues, corporate services
costs increased to 9.3% in 2010 from 8.7% in 2009 primarily due to the items noted above.

Income from
operations

increased $27.1 million, or 31.8%, to $112.4 million in 2010 from $85.3 million in 2009. Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues increased to 10.6% in 2010 from 10.0% in 2009. This increase was a result of the
items discussed above.

Interest expense, net

remained unchanged at $2.3 million in 2010 and 2009.

Other expense, net

increased $0.7 million to $1.2 million in 2010 from $0.5 million in 2009. The increase in 2010 was
due to higher net losses on the combined foreign currency exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in the Euro and Canadian dollar and our derivative financial instruments as compared to 2009.

Provision for income taxes

increased $4.8 million to $40.4 million in 2010 from $35.6 million in 2009. Our effective
tax rate was 37.1% in 2010 compared to 43.2% in 2009, primarily due to tax planning strategies and federal and state tax credits reducing the effective tax rate, partially offset by a valuation allowance recorded against our foreign net operating
loss carryforward.

Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008

Net revenues

increased $131.2 million, or 18.1%, to $856.4 million in 2009 from $725.2 million in 2008.

Net revenues by geographic region

are summarized below:

Net revenues in North America increased $115.6 million to $808.0 million in 2009 from $692.4 million in 2008
primarily due to increased net sales in apparel and footwear as discussed below. Net revenues in other foreign countries increased by $15.5 million to $48.4 million in 2009 from $32.9 million in 2008 primarily due to increased apparel sales in our
EMEA operating segment.



Net revenues by product category

are summarized below:

Net sales

increased $127.8 million, or 18.4%, to $823.1 million in 2009 from $695.3 million
in 2008 as noted in the table above. The increase in net sales primarily reflects:

•

$51.4 million increase in footwear sales driven primarily by our running footwear launch during the first quarter of 2009;

•

$51.8 million increase in direct to consumer sales growth, including the impact of footwear; and

•

apparel unit growth driven by increased distribution and new offerings in multiple product categories, most significantly in our training, fitness,
running and underwear categories.

License revenues

increased $3.3
million, or 11.2%, to $33.3 million in 2009 from $30.0 million in 2008. This increase in license revenues was a result of increased sales by our licensees due to increased distribution and continued unit volume growth, along with new license
agreements for team uniforms and custom-molded mouth guards.

Gross profit

increased $57.1 million
to $410.1 million in 2009 from $353.0 million in 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues, or gross margin, decreased 80 basis points to 47.9% in 2009 compared to 48.7% in 2008. The decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily driven
by the following:

•

increased footwear and apparel liquidations to third parties, accounting for an approximate 40 basis point decrease;

•

less favorable footwear and apparel product mix relative to margins, accounting for an approximate 40 basis point decrease; and

•

increased footwear and accessory inventory reserves, accounting for an approximate 20 basis point decrease; partially offset by

•

increased direct to consumer higher margin sales, accounting for an approximate 30 basis point increase.

Selling, general and administrative expenses

increased $48.8 million, or 17.7%, to $324.9 million in 2009 from $276.1 million in
2008. As a percentage of net revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased slightly to 37.9% in 2009 from 38.1% in 2008. These changes were primarily attributable to the following:

•

Marketing costs increased $12.8 million to $108.9 million in 2009 from $96.1 million in 2008 primarily due to increased sponsorships of collegiate and
professional teams and new events, including the National Football League Scouting Combine, and increased marketing costs for specific customers, including our in-store brand campaign supporting the introduction of our performance running footwear.
These increases were partially offset by lower media and print expenditures in 2009. As a



percentage of net revenues, marketing costs decreased to 12.7% in 2009 from 13.3% in 2008 primarily due to lower media and print expenditures costs in 2009, partially offset by the other items
noted above.

•

Selling costs increased $13.5 million to $69.6 million in 2009 from $56.1 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to costs incurred for the
continued expansion of our direct to consumer sales channel and higher personnel costs, including increased expenses for our performance incentive plan as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of net revenues, selling costs increased to 8.1%
in 2009 from 7.7% in 2008 due to increased costs incurred for the continued expansion of our factory house stores, partially offset by decreased apparel selling personnel costs as a percentage of net revenues.

•

Product innovation and supply chain costs increased $13.4 million to $71.8 million in 2009 from $58.4 million in 2008 primarily due to higher personnel
costs for the design and sourcing of our expanding apparel and footwear lines, including increased expenses for our performance incentive plan as compared to the prior year. In addition, this increase was due to higher distribution facilities
operating and personnel costs to support our growth. As a percentage of net revenues, product innovation and supply chain costs increased to 8.4% in 2009 from 8.1% in 2008 due to the items noted above.

•

Corporate services costs increased $9.1 million to $74.6 million in 2009 from $65.5 million in 2008. This increase was attributable primarily to higher
personnel costs for additional corporate personnel necessary to support our growth, including increased expenses for our performance incentive plan as compared to the prior year. In addition, this increase was due to higher company-wide stock-based
compensation and increased investments in consumer insight research. These increases were partially offset by decreased allowances for bad debts during 2009. As a percentage of net revenues, corporate services costs increased to 8.7% in 2009 from
9.0% in 2008 due to the items noted above.

Income from operations

increased $8.4 million, or 10.9%,
to $85.3 million in 2009 from $76.9 million in 2008. Income from operations as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 10.0% in 2009 from 10.6% in 2008. This decrease was a result of a decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net
revenues as discussed above.

Interest expense, net

increased $1.4 million to $2.3 million in 2009 from $0.9 million in
2008. This increase was primarily due to the write-off of deferred financing costs related to our prior revolving credit facility and increased costs for our revolving credit facility during 2009.

Other expense, net

decreased $5.7 million to $0.5 million in 2009 from $6.2 million in 2008. This change was primarily
due to our expanded foreign currency exchange hedging strategy in 2009 that reduced our exposure associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations primarily on intercompany transactions for our European subsidiary in 2009 as compared to
the prior year.

Provision for income taxes

increased $3.9 million to $35.6 million in 2009 from $31.7 million in 2008.
Our effective tax rate was 43.2% in 2009 compared to 45.3% in 2008. The effective tax rate in 2009 was lower than the effective tax rate in 2008 primarily due to decreased losses in our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax planning strategies
implemented during 2009.

Seasonality

Historically, we have recognized a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall
selling season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of our higher priced
COLDGEAR

®

line. Historically, a larger portion of our income from operations has been in the last two quarters
of the year partially due to the shift in the timing of marketing investments to the first two quarters of the year. The majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2010, 2009 and 2008. The level of our
working capital generally reflects the seasonality and growth in our business. We generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season.



The following table sets forth certain financial information for the periods indicated. The
data is prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. All recurring, necessary adjustments are reflected in the data below.

Financial Position, Capital Resources
and Liquidity

Our cash requirements have principally been for working capital and capital expenditures. Working capital is
primarily funded from cash flows provided by operating activities and cash and cash equivalents on hand. Our working capital requirements generally reflect the seasonality and growth in our business as we recognize the majority of our net revenues
in the back half of the year. We fund our working capital, primarily inventory, and capital investments from cash flows provided by operating activities, cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowings primarily available under our long term debt
facilities. Our capital investments have included expanding our in-store fixture and branded concept shop program, improvements and expansion of our distribution and corporate facilities to support our growth, leasehold improvements to our new
factory house and specialty stores, and investment and improvements in information technology systems. In 2011, our capital expenditures are expected to include the purchase, subject to certain closing conditions, of part of our corporate office
complex for $60.5 million. We intend to fund this purchase through additional debt.

Our focus remains on inventory management
including improving our planning capabilities, managing our inventory purchases, reducing our production lead times and selling excess inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. However, we do expect several factors
to contribute to inventory growth in excess of sales growth in the first half of 2011. We are increasing our safety stock in core product offerings and seasonal products to better meet consumer demand. Core product offerings are products that we
generally plan to have available for sale for at least the next twelve months at full price. In addition, beginning in 2011, headwear and bags are being sold by us rather than by one of our licensees, which will also contribute to our expected year
over year inventory growth.

We believe our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash from operations and borrowings available
to us under our revolving credit and long term debt facilities will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months. We may require additional capital to meet our longer term
liquidity and future growth needs. Although we believe we have adequate sources of liquidity over the long term, a prolonged economic recession or a slow recovery could adversely affect our business and liquidity (refer to the “Risk
Factors” section included in Item 1A). In addition, instability in or tightening of the capital markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional capital to grow our business and will affect the cost and terms of such
capital.



Cash Flows

The following table presents the major components of net cash flows used in and provided by operating, investing and financing activities for the periods presented:

Operating Activities

Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items. Adjustments to net income for non-cash items include depreciation and amortization, unrealized foreign currency
exchange rate gains and losses, losses on disposals of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, deferred income taxes and changes in reserves and allowances. In addition, operating cash flows include the effect of changes in operating
assets and liabilities, principally inventories, accounts receivable, income taxes payable and receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses.

Cash provided by operating activities decreased $68.9 million to $50.1 million in 2010 from $119.0 million in 2009. The decrease in cash
provided by operating activities was due to decreased net cash flows from operating assets and liabilities of $99.1 million, partially offset by an increase in net income of $21.7 million and adjustments to net income for non-cash items which
increased $8.5 million year over year. The decrease in net cash flows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities period over period was primarily driven by the following:

•

an increase in net inventory investments of $98.2 million, partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of $20.5 million. In line with our prior
guidance, inventory grew in the fourth quarter of 2010 at a rate higher than net sales growth due to increased safety stock, primarily ColdGear, to better meet anticipated consumer demand, investments around new products in 2011 including headwear,
bags and Charged Cotton, and continued increases in our made-for strategy across our factory house store base. In 2009, operational initiatives were put in place to improve our inventory management which assisted in the decrease of inventory for
that period; and

•

an increase in accounts receivable during 2010 primarily due to a 36.9% increase in net sales during the fourth quarter of 2010; partially offset by

•

higher income taxes payable in 2010 as compared to 2009.

Adjustments to net income for non-cash items increased in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to unrealized foreign currency exchange rate losses in 2010 as compared to unrealized foreign currency
exchange rate gains in 2009.

Cash provided by operating activities increased $49.5 million to $119.0 million in 2009 from
cash provided by operating activities of $69.5 million in 2008. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due to increased net cash inflows from operating assets and liabilities of $49.7 million and an increase in net income of $8.6
million, partially offset by lower adjustments to net income for non-cash items which decreased $8.8 million



year over year. The increase in net cash inflows related to changes in operating assets and liabilities period over period was primarily driven by the following:

•

a decrease in inventory of $52.5 million, primarily driven by the operational initiatives put in place to improve our inventory management, increased
liquidation sales to third parties and a larger percentage of products shipped directly from our suppliers to our customers, partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable of $21.3 million; and

•

an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of $17.0 million in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to lower performance incentive plan
payouts in 2009 as compared to 2008, as well as higher accruals to account for increased expenses for our performance incentive plan as of December 31, 2009 as compared to December 31, 2008.

Adjustments to net income for non-cash items decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily due to unrealized foreign currency exchange
rate gains in 2009 as compared to unrealized foreign currency exchange rate losses in 2008.

Investing Activities

Cash used in investing activities increased $21.9 million to $41.8 million in 2010 from $19.9 million in 2009. This increase in cash used
in investing activities was primarily due to increased investments in new factory house stores and corporate and distribution facilities, partially offset by lower investments in our in-store fixture program and branded concept shops. In addition,
cash used in investing activities increased due to a deposit made in late December 2010 for a minority equity investment completed in early 2011 in Dome Corporation, our Japanese licensee.

Cash used in investing activities decreased $22.2 million to $19.9 million in 2009 from $42.1 million in 2008. This decrease in cash used
in investing activities was primarily due to lower investments in our direct to consumer sales channel, our in-store fixture program and branded concept shops, our distribution facilities and our information technology initiatives. In addition, cash
used in investing activities decreased due to the lower purchase of trust owned life insurance policies.

Total capital
expenditures were $33.1 million, $24.6 million and $41.1 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Total capital expenditures in 2010, 2009 and 2008 included non-cash transactions of $2.9 million, $4.8 million and $2.5 million, respectively
(refer to non-cash investing activities included on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows). Because we receive certain capital expenditures prior to transmitting payment for these capital investments, total capital expenditures exceed capital
investments included in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Capital expenditures for 2011 are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million, in addition to $60.5 million relating to the purchase of part of our corporate office
complex.

Financing Activities

Cash provided by financing activities increased $23.7 million to $7.2 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $16.5 million in 2009. This increase was primarily due to the final payment
made on our prior revolving credit facility that was terminated during 2009.

Cash used in financing activities increased
$51.9 million to $16.5 million in 2009 from cash provided by financing activities of $35.4 million in 2008. This increase was primarily due to additional net payments made on our revolving credit and long term debt facilities in 2009 as compared to
2008.

Revolving Credit Facility

We have a revolving credit facility with certain lending institutions. The revolving credit facility has a term of three years, expiring in January 2012, and provides for a committed revolving credit line
of up to $200.0 million based on our qualified domestic inventory and accounts receivable balances. The commitment amount



under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $50.0 million, subject to certain conditions and approvals under the credit agreement.

The revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. It is collateralized by substantially all
of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries (other than our trademarks), and by a pledge of 65% of the equity interests of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Up to $5.0 million of the revolving credit facility may be used to support
letters of credit, of which no amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2010. We must maintain a certain leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance
with these financial covenants. The revolving credit facility also provides our lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base, even if we are in compliance with all conditions of the revolving credit facility, upon a material adverse change
to our business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations. The revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit our ability, among other things, and subject to certain limited exceptions, to incur
additional indebtedness, pledge our assets as security, guaranty obligations of third parties, make investments, undergo a merger or consolidation, dispose of assets, or materially change our line of business. In addition, the revolving credit
facility includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other debt obligations, as defined in the credit agreement, will be considered an event of default under this credit agreement.

Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest based on the daily balance outstanding at a LIBOR rate option (with LIBOR
subject to a rate floor of 1.25%) plus an applicable margin (varying from 2.0% to 2.5%) or, in certain cases at our discretion, a base rate option (based on the prime rate or as otherwise specified in the credit agreement, with the base rate subject
to a rate floor of 2.25%) plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.0% to 1.5%). The revolving credit facility also carries a commitment fee varying from 0.38% to 0.5% of the committed line amount less outstanding borrowings and letters of credit.
The applicable margins are calculated quarterly and vary based on our leverage ratio as set forth in the credit agreement.

Prior to entering the revolving credit facility in January 2009, we terminated our prior $100.0 million revolving credit facility. In
conjunction with the termination of the prior revolving credit facility, we repaid the then outstanding balance of $25.0 million. The prior revolving credit facility was also collateralized by substantially all of our assets, other than our
trademarks, and included covenants, conditions and other terms similar to our current revolving credit facility.

As of
December 31, 2010, borrowings under our $200 million revolving credit facility were limited to approximately $151.5 million based on our eligible domestic inventory and accounts receivable balances. The weighted average interest rate on the
balances outstanding under the prior revolving credit facility was 1.4% and 3.7% during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. No balances were outstanding under the current revolving credit facility during the years ended
December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Long Term Debt

We have long term debt agreements with various lenders to finance the acquisition of or lease of qualifying capital investments. Loans under these agreements are collateralized by a first lien on the
related assets acquired. As these agreements are not committed facilities, each advance is subject to approval by the lenders. Additionally, these agreements include a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other debt obligations,
including our revolving credit facility, will be considered an event of default under these agreements. In addition, these agreements require a prepayment fee if we pay outstanding amounts ahead of the scheduled terms. The terms of our revolving
credit facility limit the total amount of additional financing under these agreements to $35.0 million, of which $22.1 million was remaining as of December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding principal balance under
these agreements was $15.9 million and $20.1 million, respectively. Currently, advances under these agreements bear interest rates which are fixed at the time of each advance. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 5.3%,
5.9% and 6.1% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



We monitor the financial health and stability of our lenders under the revolving credit and
long term debt facilities, however continuing significant instability in the credit markets could negatively impact lenders and their ability to perform under their facilities.

Contractual Commitments and Contingencies

We lease warehouse space, office
facilities, space for our factory house and specialty stores and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating and capital leases. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, excluding extensions at our option, and contain various provisions
for rental adjustments. In addition, this table includes executed lease agreements for factory house stores that we did not yet occupy as of December 31, 2010. The operating leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of
time. Our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2010 are summarized in the following table:

(1)

Excludes a total of $1.1 million in interest payments on long term debt obligations.

(2)

Includes the minimum payments for operating lease obligations. The operating lease obligations do not include any contingent rent expense we may incur at our factory
house stores based on future sales above a specified minimum or payments made for maintenance, insurance and real estate taxes.

(3)

We generally place orders with our manufacturers at least three to four months in advance of expected future sales. The amounts listed for product purchase obligations
primarily represent our open production purchase orders for our apparel, footwear and accessories, including expected inbound freight, duties and other costs. These open purchase orders specify fixed or minimum quantities of products at determinable
prices. The reported amounts exclude product purchase liabilities included in accounts payable as of December 31, 2010.

(4)

Includes footwear promotional rights fees, sponsorships of individual athletes, sports teams and athletic events and other marketing commitments in order to promote our
brand. Some of these sponsorship agreements provide for additional performance incentives and product supply obligations. It is not possible to determine how much we will spend on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally
do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products. The amount of product provided to these sponsorships depends on many factors including general playing conditions, the number of sporting events in which they participate and our
decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar
costs incurred for products sold to customers. In addition, it is not possible to determine the amounts we may be required to pay under these agreements as they are primarily subject to certain performance based variables. The amounts listed above
are the fixed minimum amounts required to be paid under these agreements.

The table above excludes a $6.4
million liability for uncertain tax positions, including the related interest and penalties, recorded in accordance with applicable accounting guidance, as we are unable to reasonably estimate the timing of settlement. Refer to Note 10 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of our uncertain tax positions.



In addition, the table above excludes the expected purchase of part of our corporate office
complex of $60.5 million. The purchase is subject to certain closing conditions. We expect the transaction to close in early 2011. We expect this transaction to have minimal impact on cash flows both from a purchase perspective and on a go-forward
operational basis, as we intend to fund this purchase through additional debt.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

In connection with various contracts and agreements, we have agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party claims
relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items. Generally, such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which our counterparties are grossly negligent, engage in willful misconduct, or act in bad
faith. Based on our historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, we have determined the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to our financial position or results of operations.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. To prepare these financial statements, we must make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be significantly different from these estimates. We
believe the following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results.

Revenue Recognition

Net revenues consist of both net sales and license
revenues. Net sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. Transfer of title and risk of loss are based upon shipment under free on board shipping
point for most goods or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. In some instances, transfer of title and risk of loss take place at the point of sale, for example at our factory house
and specialty stores. We may also ship product directly from our supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. License revenues are recognized based upon shipment of licensed products
sold by our licensees.

Sales Returns, Allowances, Markdowns and Discounts

We record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. We base our estimates on historical
rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns, markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by us. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances, which is inherently
uncertain, may differ from our estimates. If we determine that actual or expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves we established, we would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the
period in which we make such a determination. Provisions for customer specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers.

Reserves for returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts are recorded as an offset to accounts receivable as settlements are made through offsets to outstanding customer invoices. Prior to 2010, the
majority of reserves for customer markdowns and discounts were recorded as accrued expenses as settlements were made through cash disbursements. As of December 31, 2010, there were $8.3 million in customer markdowns and discounts recorded as
offsets to accounts receivable, and no amounts were recorded as accrued expenses. As of



December 31, 2009, there were no significant customer markdowns or discounts recorded as offsets to accounts receivable, and $6.9 million was recorded as accrued expenses.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

We make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. In
determining the amount of the reserve, we consider our historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail environment that could impact the ability of our customers to pay outstanding balances and make
judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our
estimates. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate, we would
record a benefit or charge to selling, general and administrative expenses in the period in which we made such a determination.

Inventory
Valuation and Reserves

We value our inventory at standard cost which approximates our landed cost, using the first-in,
first-out method of cost determination. Market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions. If we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of such
inventory, we provide a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or market. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us, further adjustments may be required that would increase our cost of goods sold in
the period in which we make such a determination.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

We continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long-lived
assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. These factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash flows. When factors indicate that
an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, we review long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. Impairments are recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds
fair value. No material impairments were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for
temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by
valuation allowances when necessary.

Assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. We
consider all available positive and negative evidence, including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and
therefore can be uncertain. To the extent we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against our deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in
the period when such a determination is made.

Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax
position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or obtaining new
information on particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income.



Stock-Based Compensation

We account for stock-based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires all stock-based compensation awards granted to employees and directors to be measured at fair value and
recognized as an expense in the financial statements. Historically, we recognized expense for stock-based compensation awards granted prior to our initial filing of our S-1 Registration Statement in accordance with accounting guidance that allows
the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method, stock-based compensation expense of fixed stock options is based on the difference, if any, between the fair value of our stock on the grant date and the exercise price of the option. The
stock-based compensation expense for these awards was fully amortized in 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we had $19.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense, excluding performance-based stock options, expected to be recognized over a
weighted average period of 2.0 years. In addition, we had $16.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense related to performance-based stock options, expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years if all combined
operating income targets would be reached.

Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of
stock-based compensation awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected life of the stock-based compensation awards, stock price volatility and estimated forfeiture rates. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation awards. The assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation awards represent management’s best estimates, but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties
and the application of management judgment. In addition, compensation expense for performance-based awards is recorded over the related service period when achievement of the performance target is deemed probable, which requires management judgment.
As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Refer to Note 2 and Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion on
stock-based compensation.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure
requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). This amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a VIE. The amendment also requires an
enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a VIE. Finally, an enterprise will be required to disclose significant judgments and assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a VIE. This amendment is effective for
financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within the first annual period. The adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

Foreign Currency Exchange and Foreign Currency Risk Management and Derivatives

We currently generate a small amount of our consolidated net revenues in Canada and Europe. The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the U.S. dollar. To date, net revenues
generated outside of the United States have not been significant. However, as our net revenues generated outside of the United States increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For
example, if we recognize foreign revenues in local foreign currencies (as we currently do in Canada and Europe) and if the U.S. dollar strengthens, it could have a negative impact on our foreign revenues upon translation of those results into the
U.S. dollar upon consolidation of our financial statements. In addition, we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions generated by our foreign subsidiaries in currencies other than
their local currencies. These gains and losses are primarily driven by inter-company transactions. These exposures are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income.



When deemed necessary, we have used foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk
from exchange rate fluctuations on inter-company transactions and projected inventory purchases for our European and Canadian subsidiaries. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Based on the foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2010, we receive US Dollars in exchange for Canadian
Dollars at a weighted average contractual forward foreign currency exchange rate of 1.00 CAD per $1.00 and US Dollars in exchange for Euros at a weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rate of 0.76 EUR per $1.00. As of
December 31, 2010, the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward contracts for our Canadian subsidiary was $17.6 million with contract maturities of 1 month, and the notional value of our outstanding foreign currency forward
contracts for our European subsidiary was $34.8 million with contract maturities of 1 month. The foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in other expense,
net on the consolidated statements of income. The fair values of our foreign currency forward contracts were liabilities of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2010, and were included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair
values of our foreign currency forward contracts were assets of $0.3 million as of December 31, 2009, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 9 for a discussion of the fair
value measurements. Included in other expense, net were the following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts:

Although we have entered
into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize some of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on future cash flows, we cannot be assured that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not have a material adverse impact
on our financial condition and results of operations.

Inflation

Inflationary factors such as increases in the cost of our product and overhead costs may adversely affect our operating results. Although
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations to date, a high rate of inflation in the future may have an adverse effect on our ability to maintain current levels of gross margin and
selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues if the selling prices of our products do not increase with these increased costs.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company. We
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
(COSO). This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on our evaluation, we have
concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2010.

The effectiveness of
our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.

Dated: February 24, 2011



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Under Armour, Inc.:

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(1) present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of Under Armour, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company) at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2010 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In addition, in our opinion, the financial statement schedule listed in the index appearing under Item 15(a)(2) presents fairly,
in all material respects, the information set forth therein when read in conjunction with the related consolidated financial statements. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). The Company’s management is
responsible for these financial statements and financial statement schedule, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in
the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements, on the financial statement schedule, and on the Company’s internal control over
financial reporting based on our integrated audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those
policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Notes to the Audited Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Description of the Business

Under Armour, Inc. is a developer, marketer and distributor of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. These products are sold worldwide and worn by athletes at all levels, from youth
to professional on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
include the accounts of Under Armour, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. The accompanying consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at date of inception to be cash and
cash equivalents. Included in interest expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was interest income of $48.7 thousand, $102.8 thousand and $636.5 thousand, respectively, related to cash and cash equivalents.

Concentration of Credit Risk

Financial instruments that subject the Company to significant concentration of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. The majority of the Company’s accounts receivable are due from
large sporting goods retailers. Credit is extended based on an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and collateral is not required. The most significant customers that accounted for a large portion of net revenues and accounts
receivable are as follows:

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company makes ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for
estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. In determining the amount of the reserve, the Company considers historical levels of credit losses and significant economic developments within the retail
environment that could impact the ability of its customers to pay outstanding balances and makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. Because the Company cannot predict future changes in
the financial stability of its customers,



actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from estimates. If the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger
reserve might be required. In the event the Company determines a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, it would record a benefit or charge to selling, general and administrative expense in the period in which such a determination was made. As of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the allowance for doubtful accounts was $4.9 million and $5.2 million, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories consist of finished goods, raw materials and work-in-process. Costs of finished goods inventories include all
costs incurred to bring inventory to its current condition, including inbound freight, duties and other costs. The Company values its inventory at standard cost which approximates landed cost, using the first-in, first-out method of cost
determination. Market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions. If the Company determines that the estimated market value of its inventory is less than the carrying value of such inventory, it
provides a charge to cost of goods sold to reflect the lower of cost or market. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by the Company, further adjustments may be required that would increase the cost of goods sold in the
period in which such a determination was made.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are established for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax
basis of the Company’s assets and liabilities at tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled. Deferred income tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances when necessary.

Assessing whether deferred tax assets are realizable requires significant judgment. The Company considers all available positive and
negative evidence, including historical operating performance and expectations of future operating performance. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is often dependent upon future taxable income and therefore can be uncertain. To the
extent the Company believes it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, valuation allowances are established against the Company’s deferred tax assets, which increase income tax expense in the period
when such a determination is made.

Income taxes include the largest amount of tax benefit for an uncertain tax position that
is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. Settlements with tax authorities, the expiration of statutes of limitations for particular tax positions, or obtaining new information on
particular tax positions may cause a change to the effective tax rate. The Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment are stated at cost, including the cost of internal labor for software customized for internal use, less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets: 3 to 7 years for furniture, office equipment, software and plant equipment. Leasehold improvements are
amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets. The cost of in-store apparel and footwear fixtures and displays are capitalized, included in furniture, fixtures and displays, and depreciated over 3 to
5 years.

The Company capitalizes the cost of interest for long term property and equipment projects based on the
Company’s weighted average borrowing rates in place while the projects are in progress. Capitalized interest was $0.7 million and $0.4 million as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.



Upon retirement or disposition of property and equipment, the cost and accumulated
depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in selling, general and administrative expenses for that period. Major additions and betterments are capitalized to the asset accounts while maintenance and
repairs, which do not improve or extend the lives of assets, are expensed as incurred.

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets

The Company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of
long-lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable. These factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results, changes in business plans, or changes in anticipated cash flows. When factors
indicate that an asset should be evaluated for possible impairment, the Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability from future operations using undiscounted cash flows. If future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying
value, an impairment is recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value. No material impairments were recorded in the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Accrued Expenses

At
December 31, 2010, accrued expenses primarily included $31.0 million and $7.8 million of accrued compensation and benefits and marketing expenses, respectively. At December 31, 2009, accrued expenses primarily included $14.5 million, $6.9
million and $5.2 million of accrued compensation and benefits, certain customer markdowns and discounts and marketing expenses, respectively.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transactions

The functional currency for each of the Company’s wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is generally the applicable local currency. The translation of foreign currencies into U.S. dollars is performed
for assets and liabilities using current foreign currency exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and for revenue and expense accounts using average foreign currency exchange rates during the period. Capital accounts are translated at
historical foreign currency exchange rates. Translation gains and losses are included in stockholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Adjustments that arise from foreign currency exchange rate changes on
transactions, primarily driven by intercompany transactions, denominated in a currency other than the local currency are included in other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income.

Derivatives

The Company
uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The Company accounts for derivative financial instruments pursuant to
applicable accounting guidance. This guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments and requires all derivatives to be recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and to be measured
at fair value. Unrealized derivative gain positions are recorded as other current assets or other non-current assets, and unrealized derivative loss positions are recorded as accrued expenses or other long term liabilities, depending on the
derivative financial instrument’s maturity date.

Currently, the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts are
not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded to other expense, net on the consolidated statements of income. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading
purposes.



Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards. Net revenues consist of both net sales and license revenues. Net sales are recognized upon transfer of ownership, including
passage of title to the customer and transfer of risk of loss related to those goods. Transfer of title and risk of loss is based upon shipment under free on board shipping point for most goods or upon receipt by the customer depending on the
country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. In some instances, transfer of title and risk of loss takes place at the point of sale, for example, at the Company’s retail stores. The Company may also ship product directly from its
supplier to the customer and recognize revenue when the product is delivered to and accepted by the customer. License revenues are recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by the Company’s licensees. Sales taxes imposed on the
Company’s revenues from product sales are presented on a net basis on the consolidated statements of income and therefore do not impact net revenues or costs of goods sold.

Sales Returns, Allowances, Markdowns and Discounts

The Company records
reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns, allowances, markdowns and discounts. The Company bases its estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns,
markdowns and allowances that have not yet been received by the Company. The actual amount of customer returns and allowances, which is inherently uncertain, may differ from the Company’s estimates. If the Company determines that actual or
expected returns or allowances are significantly higher or lower than the reserves it established, it would record a reduction or increase, as appropriate, to net sales in the period in which it makes such a determination. Provisions for customer
specific discounts are based on contractual obligations with certain major customers.

Reserves for returns, allowances,
markdowns and discounts are recorded as an offset to accounts receivable as settlements are made through offsets to outstanding customer invoices. Prior to 2010, the majority of reserves for customer markdowns and discounts were recorded as accrued
expenses as settlements were made through cash disbursements. As of December 31, 2010, there were $8.3 million in customer markdowns and discounts recorded as offsets to accounts receivable, and no amounts were recorded as accrued expenses. As
of December 31, 2009, there were no significant customer markdowns or discounts recorded as offsets to accounts receivable, and $6.9 million was recorded as accrued expenses.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are charged to selling, general and
administrative expenses. Advertising production costs are expensed the first time an advertisement related to such production costs is run. Media (television, print and radio) placement costs are expensed in the month during which the advertisement
appears. In addition, advertising costs include sponsorship expenses. Accounting for sponsorship payments is based upon specific contract provisions and the payments are generally expensed uniformly over the term of the contract after giving
recognition to periodic performance compliance provisions of the contracts. Advertising expense, including amortization of in-store marketing fixtures and displays, was $128.2 million, $108.9 million and $96.1 million for the years ended
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, prepaid advertising costs were $3.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively.

Shipping and Handling Costs

The Company charges certain customers shipping
and handling fees. These fees are recorded in net revenues. The Company includes outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods to customers as a component of cost of goods sold. The Company includes the majority of outbound handling costs as
a component of selling, general and administrative expenses. Outbound handling costs include costs associated with preparing goods to ship to customers and certain costs to operate the Company’s distribution facilities. These costs, included
within selling, general and administrative expenses, were $14.7 million, $12.2 million and $10.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



Earnings per Share

Basic earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Any
stock-based compensation awards that are determined to be participating securities are included in the calculation of basic earnings per share using the two class method. Diluted earnings per common share is computed by dividing net income available
to common stockholders for the period by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution from common shares issuable through stock options, warrants, restricted
stock units and other equity awards. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of earnings per share.

Stock-Based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with accounting guidance that requires all stock-based
compensation awards granted to employees and directors to be measured at fair value and recognized as an expense in the financial statements. In addition, this guidance requires that excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation awards be
reflected as financing cash flows.

The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair market value
of stock-based compensation awards. As the Company does not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected life due to the limited period of time its shares of Class A Common Stock
have been publicly traded, it uses the “simplified method” as permitted by accounting guidance. The “simplified method” calculates the expected life of a stock option equal to the time from grant to the midpoint between the
vesting date and contractual term, taking into account all vesting tranches. The risk free interest rate is based on the yield for the U.S. Treasury bill with a maturity equal to the expected life of the stock option. Expected volatility is based on
an average for a peer group of companies similar in terms of type of business, industry, stage of life cycle and size. Compensation expense is recognized net of forfeitures on a straight-line basis over the total vesting period, which is the implied
requisite service period. Compensation expense for performance-based awards is recorded over the implied requisite service period when achievement of the performance target is deemed probable. The forfeiture rate is estimated at the date of grant
based on historical rates.

In addition, the Company recognized expense for stock-based compensation awards granted prior to
the Company’s initial filing of its S-1 Registration Statement in accordance with accounting guidance that allows the intrinsic value method. Under the intrinsic value method, stock-based compensation expense of fixed stock options is based on
the difference, if any, between the fair value of the company’s stock on the grant date and the exercise price of the option. The stock-based compensation expense for these awards was fully amortized in 2010. Had the Company elected to account
for all stock-based compensation awards at fair value, net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 would have been reported as set forth in the following table:



The Company issues new shares of Class A Common Stock upon exercise of stock options,
grant of restricted stock or share unit conversion. Refer to Note 12 for further details on stock-based compensation.

Management Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates, including estimates relating to assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts shown for the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short term maturity of those instruments. The
fair value of the long term debt approximates its carrying value based on the variable nature of interest rates and current market rates available to the Company.

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards

In June 2009, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable interest entities (“VIEs”). This amendment requires an enterprise to perform a qualitative
analysis when determining whether or not it must consolidate a VIE. The amendment also requires an enterprise to continuously reassess whether it must consolidate a VIE. Finally, an enterprise will be required to disclose significant judgments and
assumptions used to determine whether or not to consolidate a VIE. This amendment was effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after November 15, 2009, and for interim periods within the first annual period. The
adoption of this amendment did not have any impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Reclassifications

Outbound freight costs associated with shipping goods of $9.2 million and $7.0 million included in selling, general and
administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were reclassified to cost of goods sold to conform to the presentation for the year ended December 31, 2010. In addition, costs of $6.3 million and $5.1
million associated with the Company’s sourcing offices and Special Make-Up Shop included in cost of goods sold for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively, were reclassified to selling, general and administrative expenses
to conform to the presentation for the years ended December 31, 2010. The Company believes these changes were appropriate given its view that cost of goods sold should primarily include product costs which are variable in nature. In addition,
these reclassifications more closely align with the way the Company manages its business.



3. Inventories

Inventories consisted of the following:

4. Property and Equipment, Net

Property and equipment consisted of the following:

Construction in progress primarily includes costs incurred for software systems, leasehold improvements and
in-store fixtures and displays not yet placed in use.

Depreciation and amortization expense related to property and equipment
was $28.7 million, $25.3 million and $19.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

5. Intangible Assets, Net

The following table summarizes the Company’s intangible assets as of the periods indicated:

Intangible assets are amortized using estimated useful lives of 55 months to 89 months with no residual
value. Amortization expense, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, was $2.0 million, $1.9 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The estimated amortization
expense of the Company’s intangible assets is $2.1 million, $1.0 million and $0.6 million for the years ending December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, and $0.1 million for each of the years ending December 31, 2014 and 2015.



6. Revolving Credit Facility and Long Term Debt

Revolving Credit Facility

The Company has a revolving credit facility with
certain lending institutions. The revolving credit facility has a term of three years, expiring in January 2012, and provides for a committed revolving credit line of up to $200.0 million based on the Company’s qualified domestic inventory and
accounts receivable balances. The commitment amount under the revolving credit facility may be increased by an additional $50.0 million, subject to certain conditions and approvals under the credit agreement.

The revolving credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. It is collateralized by substantially all
of the assets of the Company and its domestic subsidiaries (other than the Company’s trademarks), and by a pledge of 65% of the equity interests of certain of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries. Up to $5.0 million of the revolving credit
facility may be used to support letters of credit, of which no amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2010. The Company must maintain a certain leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement. As of
December 31, 2010, the Company was in compliance with these financial covenants. The revolving credit facility also provides the lenders with the ability to reduce the borrowing base, even if the Company is in compliance with all conditions of
the revolving credit facility, upon a material adverse change to the business, properties, assets, financial condition or results of operations of the Company. The revolving credit facility contains a number of restrictions that limit the
Company’s ability, among other things, and subject to certain limited exceptions, to incur additional indebtedness, pledge its assets as security, guaranty obligations of third parties, make investments, undergo a merger or consolidation,
dispose of assets, or materially change its line of business. In addition, the revolving credit facility includes a cross default provision whereby an event of default under other debt obligations, as defined in the credit agreement, will be
considered an event of default under this credit agreement.

Borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest
based on the daily balance outstanding at a LIBOR rate option (with LIBOR subject to a rate floor of 1.25%) plus an applicable margin (varying from 2.0% to 2.5%) or, in certain cases at the Company’s discretion, a base rate option (based on the
prime rate or as otherwise specified in the credit agreement, with the base rate subject to a rate floor of 2.25%) plus an applicable margin (varying from 1.0% to 1.5%). The revolving credit facility also carries a commitment fee varying from 0.38%
to 0.5% of the committed line amount less outstanding borrowings and letters of credit. The applicable margins are calculated quarterly and vary based on the Company’s leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement.

Prior to entering into the revolving credit facility in January 2009, the Company terminated its prior $100.0 million revolving credit
facility. In conjunction with the termination of the prior revolving credit facility, the Company repaid the then outstanding balance of $25.0 million. The prior revolving credit facility was also collateralized by substantially all of the
Company’s assets, other than its trademarks, and included covenants, conditions and other terms similar to the Company’s current revolving credit facility.

As of December 31, 2010, borrowings under the $200 million revolving credit facility were limited to approximately $151.5 million based on the Company’s eligible domestic inventory and accounts
receivable balances. The weighted average interest rates on the balances outstanding under the prior revolving credit facility were 1.4% and 3.7% during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No balances were outstanding
under the current revolving credit facility during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009.

Long Term Debt

The Company has long term debt agreements with various lenders to finance the acquisition or lease of qualifying capital investments.
Loans under these agreements are collateralized by a first lien on the related assets acquired. As these agreements are not committed facilities, each advance is subject to approval by the lenders. Additionally, these agreements include a cross
default provision whereby an event of default under other



debt obligations, including the Company’s revolving credit facility, will be considered an event of default under these agreements. These agreements require a prepayment fee if the Company
pays outstanding amounts ahead of the scheduled terms. The terms of the revolving credit facility limit the total amount of additional financing under these agreements to $35.0 million, of which $22.1 million was remaining as of December 31,
2010. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding principal balance under these agreements was $15.9 million and $20.1 million, respectively. Currently, advances under these agreements bear interest rates which are fixed at the time of each
advance. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings was 5.3%, 5.9% and 6.1% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The following is a schedule of future principal payments on long term debt as of December 31, 2010:

The Company monitors the financial health and stability of its lenders under the revolving credit and long
term debt facilities, however continued significant instability in the credit markets could negatively impact lenders and their ability to perform under their facilities.

Interest expense, net includes interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs of $2.3 million, $2.4 million and $1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

7. Commitments and Contingencies

Obligations Under Operating and Capital Leases

The Company leases
warehouse space, office facilities, space for its retail stores and certain equipment under non-cancelable operating and capital leases. The leases expire at various dates through 2021, excluding extensions at the Company’s option, and include
provisions for rental adjustments. The table below includes executed lease agreements for factory house stores that the Company did not yet occupy as of December 31, 2010. The following is a schedule of future minimum lease payments for
non-cancelable operating leases as of December 31, 2010:

Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $19.3 million, $14.1 million and
$12.9 million, respectively, under non-cancelable operating lease agreements. Included in these amounts was contingent rent expense of $2.0 million, $0.6 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.



The Company had no outstanding capital lease agreements as of December 31, 2010 and no
significant outstanding capital lease agreements as of December 31, 2009.

Sponsorships and Other Marketing Commitments

Within the normal course of business, the Company enters into contractual commitments in order to promote the
Company’s brand and products. These commitments include sponsorship agreements with teams and athletes on the collegiate and professional levels, official supplier agreements, athletic event sponsorships and other marketing commitments. The
following is a schedule of the Company’s future minimum payments under its sponsorship and other marketing agreements as of December 31, 2010:

The amounts listed above are the minimum obligations required to be paid under the Company’s
sponsorship and other marketing agreements. The amounts listed above do not include additional performance incentives and product supply obligations provided under certain agreements. It is not possible to determine how much the Company will spend
on product supply obligations on an annual basis as contracts generally do not stipulate specific cash amounts to be spent on products. The amount of product provided to the sponsorships depends on many factors including general playing conditions,
the number of sporting events in which they participate and the Company’s decisions regarding product and marketing initiatives. In addition, the costs to design, develop, source and purchase the products furnished to the endorsers are incurred
over a period of time and are not necessarily tracked separately from similar costs incurred for products sold to customers.

Other

The Company is, from time to time, involved in routine legal matters incidental to its business. The Company believes that
the ultimate resolution of any such current proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In connection with various contracts and agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify counterparties against certain third party
claims relating to the infringement of intellectual property rights and other items. Generally, such indemnification obligations do not apply in situations in which the counterparties are grossly negligent, engage in willful misconduct, or act in
bad faith. Based on the Company’s historical experience and the estimated probability of future loss, the Company has determined that the fair value of such indemnifications is not material to its consolidated financial position or results of
operations.

8. Stockholders’ Equity

The Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock have an authorized number of shares of 100.0 million shares and 12.5 million shares, respectively, and each have
a par value of $0.0003 1/3 per share. Holders of Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock have identical rights, except that the holders of Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share and holders of Class
B Convertible Common Stock are entitled to 10 votes per share on all matters submitted to a stockholder vote. Class B Convertible Common Stock may only be held by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), or a related party of
the CEO, as defined in the Company’s charter. As a result, the Company’s CEO has a majority voting control over the Company. Upon the transfer of shares of Class B Convertible Stock to a person



other than the Company’s CEO or a related party of the CEO, the shares automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. In addition, all of the
outstanding shares of Class B Convertible Common Stock will automatically convert into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis on the date upon which the shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock
beneficially owned by the Company’s CEO is less than 15% of the total shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Convertible Common Stock outstanding. Holders of the Company’s common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if
authorized and declared out of assets legally available for the payment of dividends.

9. Fair Value Measurements

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (an exit price).
The fair value accounting guidance outlines a valuation framework, creates a fair value hierarchy in order to increase the consistency and comparability of fair value measurements and the related disclosures and prioritizes the inputs used in
measuring fair value as follows:

Financial assets and (liabilities) measured at fair value as of December 31, 2010 are set forth in the table below:

The foreign currency forward contracts represent gains and losses on derivative contracts, which is the net difference between the U.S. dollars to be received or paid at the contracts’ settlement date and the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
currency to be sold or purchased at the current forward exchange rate. The fair value of the TOLI held by the Rabbi Trust is based on the cash-surrender value of the life insurance policies, which are invested primarily in mutual funds and a
separately managed fixed income fund. These investments are in the same funds and purchased in substantially the same amounts as the selected investments of participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan, which represent the underlying liabilities
to participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan. Liabilities under the Deferred Compensation Plan are recorded at amounts due to participants, based on the fair value of participants’ selected investments.

10. Provision for Income Taxes

Income (loss) before income taxes is as follows:



The components of the provision for income taxes consisted of the following:

A reconciliation from the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate is as
follows:

The decrease in the 2010 full year effective income tax rate, as compared to 2009, is primarily attributable
to certain tax planning strategies and federal and state tax credits reducing the effective tax rate for the period. This reduction was partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance recorded against a portion of the Company’s
deferred tax assets and additional unrecognized tax benefits.



Deferred tax assets and liabilities consisted of the following:

As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $10.9 million in deferred tax assets associated with foreign
net operating loss carryforwards which will begin to expire in 5 to 9 years. As of December 31, 2010, the Company believed certain deferred tax assets associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards would expire unused based on updated
forward-looking financial information. Therefore, a valuation allowance of $1.5 million and $1.8 million was recorded against the Company’s net deferred tax assets as of September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010, respectively. The
valuation allowance resulted in an increase to income tax expense of $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Although realization of the remaining foreign net operating loss carryforwards is not assured, the Company believes it is
more likely than not that the remaining $9.1 million will be realized. This realizable amount could be increased or decreased if future taxable income during the carryforward periods is increased or reduced.

As of December 31, 2010, withholding and U.S. taxes have not been provided on approximately $37.3 million of cumulative
undistributed earnings of the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries because the Company intends to indefinitely reinvest these earnings in its non-U.S. subsidiaries.



As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits,
including related interest and penalties, was approximately $6.4 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The following table represents a reconciliation of the Company’s total unrecognized tax benefits balances, excluding interest and
penalties, for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008:

As of December 31, 2010, $4.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties,
would impact the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized.

As of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the liability
for unrecognized tax benefits included $1.3 million, $0.9 million and $0.8 million for the accrual of interest and penalties, respectively. For each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company recorded $0.3 million, $0.2
million and $0.2 million for the accrual of interest and penalties in its consolidated statement of income.

The Company files
income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The majority of the Company’s returns for years before 2006 are no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local or foreign income tax
examinations by tax authorities. The Company may incur a decrease in the total unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months as a result of the possible expiration of certain statutes of limitations for particular tax positions.



11. Earnings per Share

The Company adopted accounting guidance during 2009 requiring any stock-based compensation awards that entitle their holders to receive dividends prior to vesting to be considered participating securities
and to be included in the calculation of basic earnings per share using the two class method. Historically, these stock-based compensation awards were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share using the treasury stock method. The
Company determined that all outstanding restricted stock awards meet the definition of participating securities and should be included in basic earnings per share using the two class method. The Company included outstanding restricted stock awards
in the calculation of basic earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 and adjusted prior period earnings per share calculations. The application of this accounting guidance decreased basic and diluted earnings per share
presented for the year ended December 31, 2008 by $0.01. The calculation of earnings per share for common stock shown below excludes the income attributable to outstanding restricted stock awards from the numerator and excludes the impact of
these awards from the denominator. The following is a reconciliation of basic earnings per share to diluted earnings per share:

Effects of potentially
dilutive securities are presented only in periods in which they are dilutive. Stock options, restricted stock units and warrants representing 0.9 million, 1.1 million and 1.0 million shares of common stock were outstanding for each of
the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, but were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect would be anti-dilutive.

12. Stock-Based Compensation

Stock Compensation Plans

The Under Armour, Inc. Amended and Restated 2005
Omnibus Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2005 Plan”) provides for the issuance of stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and other equity awards to officers, directors, key employees and other persons. In 2009, stockholders
approved amendments to the 2005 Plan, including an increase in the maximum number of shares available for issuance under the 2005 Plan from 2.7 million shares to 10.0 million shares, as well as limiting the number of stock options awarded
in any calendar year to 1.0 million for any one participant. Stock options and restricted stock awards under the 2005 Plan generally vest ratably over a four to five year period. The exercise period for stock options is generally ten years from
the date of grant. The Company generally receives a tax deduction for any ordinary income recognized by a participant in respect to an award under the 2005 Plan. The 2005 Plan terminates in 2015. As of December 31, 2010, 5.9 million shares
are available for future grants of awards under the 2005 Plan.



The Company’s 2000 Stock Option Plan (the “2000 Plan”) provided for the
issuance of stock options, restricted stock and other equity awards to officers, directors, key employees and other persons. The 2000 Plan was terminated and superseded by the 2005 Plan upon the Company’s initial public offering in November
2005. No further awards may be granted under the 2000 Plan. Stock options and restricted stock awards under the 2000 Plan generally vest ratably over a four to five year period. The exercise period for stock options generally does not exceed five
years from the date of grant. The Company generally receives a tax deduction for any ordinary income recognized by a participant in respect to an award under the 2000 Plan.

Total stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $16.2 million, $12.9 million and $8.5 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2010, the Company
had $19.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense, excluding performance-based stock options, expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.0 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Company’s Employee Stock
Purchase Plan (the “ESPP”) allows for the purchase of Class A Common Stock by all eligible employees at a 15% discount from fair market value subject to certain limits as defined in the ESPP. The maximum number of shares available
under the ESPP is 1.0 million shares. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, 39.6 thousand, 59.8 thousand and 46.6 thousand shares were purchased under the ESPP, respectively

.

2006 Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan and Deferred Stock Unit Plan

The Company’s Non-Employee Director Compensation Plan (the “Director Compensation Plan”) provides for cash compensation and equity awards to non-employee directors of the Company under the
2005 Plan. Non-employee directors have the option to defer the value of their annual cash retainers as deferred stock units in accordance with the Under Armour, Inc. 2006 Non-Employee Deferred Stock Unit Plan (the “DSU Plan”). Each new
non-employee director receives an award of restricted stock units upon the initial election to the Board of Directors, with the units covering stock valued at $0.1 million on the grant date and vesting in three equal annual installments. In
addition, each non-employee director receives, following each annual stockholders’ meeting, a grant under the 2005 Plan of restricted stock units covering stock valued at $75.0 thousand on the grant date. Each award vests 100% on the date of
the next annual stockholders’ meeting following the grant date.

The receipt of the shares otherwise deliverable upon
vesting of the restricted stock units automatically defers into deferred stock units under the DSU Plan. Under the DSU Plan each deferred stock unit represents the Company’s obligation to issue one share of the Company’s Class A
Common Stock with the shares delivered six months following the termination of the director’s service.

Stock Options

The weighted average fair value of a stock option granted for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $16.71, $7.79 and
$19.48, respectively. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted average assumptions:



A summary of the Company’s stock options as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
and changes during the years then ended is presented below:

The intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008
was $7.6 million, $14.8 million and $6.7 million, respectively.

The following table summarizes information about stock
options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2010:

Included in the
tables above are 1.1 million and 1.3 million performance-based stock options granted to officers and key employees under the 2005 Plan during the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. These performance-based stock
options have a weighted average exercise price of $20.75, and a term of ten years. These performance-based options have vestings that are tied to the achievement of certain combined annual operating income targets. Upon the achievement of each of
the combined operating income targets, 50% of the options will vest and the remaining 50% will vest one year later. If certain lower levels of combined operating income are achieved, fewer or no options will vest at that time and one year later, and
the remaining stock options will be forfeited. At this time, the combined operating income targets related to the 1.3 million performance-based stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2009 have been met, and the options
will vest 50% on February 15, 2011 and the remaining 50% will vest on February 15, 2012, subject to continued employment.

The weighted average fair value of these performance-based stock options is $11.66, and was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model consistent with the weighted average assumptions included
in the table above. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Company recorded $6.2 million and $2.9 million, respectively, in stock-based compensation expense for these performance-based stock options. As of December 31,
2010, the Company had $16.0 million of unrecognized compensation expense expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.5 years if all combined operating income targets would be reached.



Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units

A summary of the Company’s restricted stock and restricted stock units as of December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, and changes
during the years then ended is presented below:

Warrants

On August 3, 2006, the Company issued fully vested and non-forfeitable warrants to purchase 480.0 thousand shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock to NFL Properties as partial
consideration for footwear promotional rights which were recorded as an intangible asset (refer to Note 5). With the assistance of an independent third party valuation firm, the Company assessed the fair value of the warrants using various fair
value models. Using these measures, the Company concluded that the fair value of the warrants was $8.5 million. The warrants have a term of 12 years from the date of issuance and an exercise price of $36.99 per share, which was the closing price of
the Company’s Class A Common Stock on August 2, 2006. As of December 31, 2010, all outstanding warrants were exercisable, and no warrants have been exercised.

13. Other Employee Benefits

The Company offers a 401(k) Deferred Compensation Plan for the benefit of eligible employees. Employee contributions are voluntary and subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations. The Company matches
a portion of the participant’s contribution and recorded expense of $1.2 million, $1.3 million and $1.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Shares of the Company’s Class A Common Stock
are not an investment option in this plan.

In addition, the Company offers the Under Armour, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan
(the “Deferred Compensation Plan”) which allows a select group of management or highly compensated employees, as approved by the Compensation Committee, to make an annual base salary and/or bonus deferral for each year. As of
December 31, 2010 and 2009, the Deferred Compensation Plan obligations were $3.6 million and $2.7 million, respectively, and were included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.

The Company established a rabbi trust (the “Rabbi Trust”) to fund obligations to participants in the Deferred Compensation
Plan. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, the assets held in the Rabbi Trust were trust owned life insurance policies (“TOLI”) with cash-surrender values of $3.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively. These assets are consolidated as
allowed by accounting guidance, and are included in other non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 9 for a discussion of the fair value measurements of the assets held in the Rabbi Trust and the Deferred Compensation Plan
obligations.

14. Foreign Currency Risk Management and Derivatives

The Company is exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to transactions
generated by its international subsidiaries in currencies other than their local currencies. These gains and losses are primarily driven by intercompany transactions. When deemed necessary, the



Company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany transactions and projected inventory
purchases for its European and Canadian subsidiaries.

As of December 31, 2010, the notional value of the Company’s
outstanding foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its Canadian subsidiary’s intercompany transactions was $17.6 million with contract maturities of 1 month. As of
December 31, 2010, the notional value of the Company’s outstanding foreign currency forward contracts used to mitigate the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on its European subsidiary’s intercompany transactions was $34.8
million with contract maturities of 1 month. The foreign currency forward contracts are not designated as cash flow hedges, and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings. The fair values of the Company’s foreign currency
forward contracts were liabilities of $0.6 million as of December 31, 2010, and were included in accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheet. The fair values of the Company’s foreign currency forward contracts were assets of $0.3
million as of December 31, 2009, and were included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 9 for a discussion of the fair value measurements. Included in other expense, net were the
following amounts related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and derivative foreign currency forward contracts:

The Company enters into
foreign currency forward contracts with major financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings and is exposed to credit losses in the event of non-performance by these financial institutions. This credit risk is generally limited to the
unrealized gains in the foreign currency forward contracts. However, the Company monitors the credit quality of these financial institutions and considers the risk of counterparty default to be minimal.

15. Related Party Transactions

The Company has an agreement to license a software system with a vendor whose Co-CEO is a director of the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, the Company paid $1.5
million, $2.0 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in licensing fees and related support services to this vendor. There were no amounts payable to this related party as of December 31, 2010. Amounts payable to this related party as of
December 31, 2009 were $0.1 million.

The Company has an operating lease agreement with an entity controlled by the
Company’s CEO to lease an aircraft for business purposes. The Company paid $1.0 million in usage fees to this entity for its use of the aircraft during the year ended December 31, 2010, and $0.6 million during each of the years ended
December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. No amounts were payable to this related party as of December 31, 2010. Amounts payable to this related party as of December 31, 2009 were $0.1 million. The Company determined the usage fees
charged are at or below market.

16. Segment Data and Related Information

The Company historically operated within one operating and reportable segment based on how the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) managed the business. During 2010, the Company’s
operating segments changed to reflect how the CODM makes decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance. In order to make these decisions, the CODM receives discrete financial information by geographic region based on



the Company’s strategy to become a global brand. These geographic regions include North America; Latin America; Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia. The
Company’s new operating segments are based on these geographic regions. Each geographic segment operates exclusively in one industry: the development, marketing and distribution of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories. As the
Latin America, EMEA and Asia operating segments did not meet the quantitative thresholds for individual disclosure as reportable segments, they were combined into other foreign countries.

The geographic distribution of the Company’s net revenues, operating income and total assets are summarized in the following tables
based on the location of its customers and operations. Net revenues represent sales to external customers for each segment. In addition to net revenues, operating income is a primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of
each segment. Intercompany balances were eliminated for separate disclosure and corporate expenses have not been allocated to other foreign countries. Prior period data included below was reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.

Net revenues by product category are as follows:



During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, substantially all of the
Company’s long-lived assets were located in the United States. Net revenues in the United States were $952.9 million, $771.2 million and $660.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

17. Unaudited Quarterly Financial Data

18. Subsequent Events

Long Term Investment

In December 2010, the Company advanced $11.1 million
to Dome Corporation (“Dome”), its Japanese licensee, in order to make a minority equity investment in Dome which closed in January 2011. In February 2011, the Company purchased an additional $3.7 million of equity from existing Dome
shareholders.

Stockholders’ Equity

In February 2011, 312.5 thousand shares of Class B Convertible Common Stock were converted into shares of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis in connection with a stock sale.

Stock-Based Compensation

In February 2011, 0.3 million performance-based restricted stock units were awarded to certain officers and key employees under the
2005 Plan. The performance-based restricted stock units have vesting that is tied to the achievement of a certain combined annual operating income target for 2012 and 2013. Upon the achievement of the combined operating income target, 50% of the
restricted stock units will vest on February 15, 2014 and the remaining 50% will vest on February 15, 2015. If certain lower levels of combined operating income for 2012 and 2013 are achieved, fewer or no restricted stock units will vest
at that time and one year later, and the remaining restricted stock units will be forfeited.

In addition, 0.2 million
shares of restricted stock were awarded to a certain executive in February 2011. These shares of restricted stock have a vesting term of ten years.
