PART I

Item 1. Business.

General Description

The St. Paul Companies, Inc. ("The St. Paul") is incorporated as a general business corporation under the laws of the State of Minnesota. The St. Paul and
its subsidiaries constitute one of the oldest insurance organizations in the United States, dating back to 1853. We are a management company principally engaged, through our subsidiaries, in providing
commercial property-liability insurance and nonlife reinsurance products and services worldwide. We also have a presence in the asset management industry through our 77% majority ownership of The John
Nuveen Company ("Nuveen"). As a management company, we oversee the operations of our subsidiaries and provide them with capital, management and administrative services. At March 1, 2002, The
St. Paul and its subsidiaries employed approximately 10,200 persons. Based on total revenues, we ranked No. 222 on the 2000

Fortune 500

list of
the largest companies in the United States.

Our
consolidated $1.4 billion pretax loss from continuing operations in 2001 was driven by $941 million of pretax losses from the September 11 terrorist attack and
pretax provisions to strengthen prior-year insurance loss reserves in our Health Care underwriting segment totaling $735 million. In addition, realized investment losses of
$94 million, goodwill write-downs totaling $73 million and restructuring charges of $62 million contributed to our pretax loss in 2001.

Property-liability
results in all three years in the table benefited from the aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties described on page 11 of this report.
Excluding the impact of those reinsurance treaties, net written premiums totaled $7.89 billion in 2001, 24% higher than comparable 2000 premium volume of $6.36 billion. The increase was
driven by price increases throughout our underwriting operations, and new business in many of those operations. Price increases in our U.S. underwriting operations averaged over 16% in 2001, and those
increases accelerated further in the fourth quarter in the aftermath of the terrorist attack.

Our
asset management subsidiary, Nuveen, posted its seventh consecutive year of record earnings on the strength of record-high product sales and a strategic acquisition that
expanded its product offerings for institutional investors.

The
following discussion summarizes the major events and transactions that impacted our results in 2001.


September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack.

On Sept. 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked four
commercial passenger jets in the United States. Two of the jets were flown into the World Trade Center towers in New York, N.Y., causing their collapse. The third jet was flown into the Pentagon
building in Washington, D.C., and the fourth jet crashed in rural Pennsylvania. The terrorist attack caused significant loss of life and resulted in unprecedented losses for the property-liability
insurance industry, including $941 million in net pretax losses for The St. Paul. Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements on page 50 of our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders,
which includes additional information regarding the terrorist attack, is incorporated herein by reference.

Withdrawal from Certain Lines of Business and Related Goodwill Write-Down.

In
December 2001, we announced a series of strategic actions designed to improve our profitability, summarized as follows:

•

We
will exit, on a global basis, all business underwritten in our Health Care segment, through the cessation of new business and the non-renewal
of business upon policy expiration, in accordance with regulatory requirements.

•

We
will narrow the product offerings and geographic presence of our reinsurance operations. We will no longer underwrite aviation or bond and credit
reinsurance, or offer certain financial risk and capital
markets reinsurance products. We will also substantially reduce the North American reinsurance business we underwrite in London. Our reinsurance operation will focus on certain coverages, including
property catastrophe reinsurance, excess-of-loss casualty reinsurance, and marine and traditional finite reinsurance.

•

In
our operations at Lloyd's, we will exit most of our casualty insurance and reinsurance business, in addition to U.S. surplus lines and certain
non-marine reinsurance lines of business. We will continue to underwrite aviation, marine, financial and professional services, property insurance, kidnap and ransom, accident and health,
creditor and other personal specialty products.

•

We
will exit those countries where we have determined that it is unlikely we will achieve competitive scale, and we are pursuing the sale of certain of these
international operations. We will no longer underwrite business in Germany, France, the Netherlands, Argentina, Mexico (excluding surety business, which will continue), Spain, Australia, New Zealand,
Botswana and South Africa. We will continue to underwrite business through our offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, and Ireland.

The
businesses we are exiting have been placed in "runoff," meaning that we have ceased or plan to cease underwriting business in these operations as soon as possible. The operations
placed in runoff collectively accounted for $1.61 billion, or 22%, of our net earned premiums and $1.5 billion of underwriting losses in 2001. In connection with these strategic actions,
we wrote off $73 million of goodwill in 2001 related to the businesses to be exited.

2001 Restructuring Charge.

In December 2001, in connection with our announced intention to
withdraw from the foregoing businesses and as part of our overall effort to reduce company-wide expenses, we announced plans to eliminate approximately 1,200 employee positions and reduce
the amount of office space we lease. We recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $62 million in 2001 related to these plans. Note 16 on pages 67 and 68 of our 2001 Annual Report to
Shareholders, which includes additional information about the components of the restructuring charge, is incorporated herein by reference.

Elimination of One-Quarter Reporting Lag.

In 2001, we eliminated the
one-quarter reporting lag for our primary underwriting operations in foreign countries (not including our operations at Lloyd's), and now report the results of those operations on a
current basis. The incremental impact on our property-liability operations of eliminating the reporting lag, which consisted of the results of these operations for the three months ended
Dec. 31, 2001, increased our net written premiums by $71 million, net earned premiums by $86 million, GAAP underwriting losses by $45 million, net investment income by
$14 million, and our pretax loss from continuing operations by $31 million.


Sale of Life Insurance Operations.

In September 2001, we sold Fidelity and Guaranty Life
Insurance Company ("F&G Life") to Old Mutual plc, a London-based international financial services company, for $335 million in cash and Old Mutual common shares with a value of
$300 million on the closing date. We recorded an after-tax loss of $73 million on the sale of F&G Life. Also in September 2001, we
sold American Continental Life Insurance Company to CNA Financial Corporation, recording an after-tax loss of $1 million on cash sale proceeds of $21 million. Notes 14 and 15
on pages 64 through 67 of our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which provide more information regarding the terms of, and contingent liabilities related to, the sale of these operations, are
incorporated herein by reference.

Repurchase of Common Shares.

In 2001, we repurchased and retired approximately 13 million of
our common shares for a total cost of $589 million. The shares repurchased represented 6% of our total shares outstanding at the beginning of the year. The repurchases were financed through a
combination of internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper debt.

Issuance of Preferred Securities.

In November 2001, we issued $575 million of Trust
Preferred Securities through St. Paul Capital Trust I, which was formed for the sole purpose of issuing these securities. The securities pay a quarterly distribution at an annual rate of 7.6% and
mature on Oct. 15, 2050. In December 2001, $500 million of the proceeds from the issuance of these securities was contributed to the policyholders' surplus of our largest primary
insurance underwriting subsidiary in the United States.

Business Segments

The following table summarizes the sources of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations for each of the years 1999 through 2001. Following the table is
a narrative description of each of our business segments. Additional financial information about our business segments is set forth in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements on pages
70 through 72 of our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference. Also included in Note 19 is a discussion of the new segment reporting structure we
implemented in 2001 after an extensive strategic review of our property-liability insurance underwriting operations. All data for 2000 and 1999 in the following table are presented on a basis

Narrative Description of Business

Property-Liability Insurance

Our property-liability insurance operations consist of five business segments that underwrite primary insurance

("Primary Insurance
Operations

"), a reinsurance segment ("

St. Paul Re

"), and an investment segment responsible for administering and overseeing our
property-liability investment portfolio. Our Primary Insurance Operations underwrite property and liability insurance and provide insurance-related products and services to commercial and professional
customers throughout the United States and in selected international markets. In the United States, our largest primary insurance underwriting subsidiary is St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company
("Fire and Marine").

The
primary sources of property-liability revenues are premiums earned from insurance policies and reinsurance contracts, income earned from the investment portfolio and gains from sales
of investments. According to the most recent industry statistics published in "Best's Review" with respect to property-liability insurers doing business in the United States, our property-liability
underwriting operations ranked 15

th

on the basis of 2000 written premiums.

Principal Departments and Products.

The "Underwriting Results by Segment" table included in "Management's Discussion and
Analysis" on page 21 of our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which summarizes written premiums, underwriting results, statutory combined ratios and adjusted combined ratios (as described in the
footnote to the table) for each of our underwriting segments for the last three years, is incorporated herein by reference. The following discussion provides more information about the structure of,
and products offered by, our property-liability insurance underwriting segments.

Primary Insurance Operations

Our Primary Insurance Operations consist of the following five business segments:

Specialty Commercial.

This segment consists of 11 business centers that we have designated specialty commercial operations
because each provides dedicated underwriting, claim and risk control services that require specialized expertise, and each business center focuses exclusively on the respective customer group that it
serves. These business centers, which collectively generated $2.1 billion of net
written premiums in 2001, are as follows:

Technology

offers a comprehensive portfolio of specialty products and services to companies involved in
telecommunications, information technology, medical technology, biotechnology, and electronics manufacturing.

Financial and Professional Services

provides coverages for financial institutions, including property, liability, professional liability and management liability coverages. This business center also provides financial products coverages
for corporations and nonprofit organizations, and errors and omissions coverages for a variety of professionals such as lawyers, insurance agents, real estate agents and appraisers.

Public Sector Services

markets insurance products and services, including professional liability coverages, to cities, counties, townships and special
governmental districts.

Discover Re

underwrites primary insurance and reinsurance and provides related services to self-insured companies
and insurance pools, in addition to ceding to and reinsuring captive insurers, all within the alternative risk transfer market. Through alternative risk transfer, a company self-insures,
or insures through a captive insurer, the portion of its own losses which are predictable and purchases insurance for the less predictable, high-severity losses that could have a major
financial impact on the company.

Catastrophe Risk

underwrites property coverages for major U.S. corporations and personal property coverages in certain
states exposed to earthquakes and hurricanes.

Ocean Marine

provides a variety of property-liability insurance coverage internationally for ocean and inland waterways traffic, including
cargo and hull property protection.

Umbrella

/

Excess & Surplus Lines

underwrites umbrella and
excess liability coverages, as well as property and liability insurance for high-risk classes of business and unique, sometimes one-of-a-kind risks that
standard insurance markets generally avoid.

Oil & Gas

provides specialized insurance products for customers involved in the exploration and
production of oil and gas, including operators, drillers and oil servicing contractors.

Transportation

offers a broad range of coverage options for the
trucking industry.

National Programs

underwrites comprehensive insurance programs that are national in scope. The

International
Specialty

business center is comprised of specialty insurance business in several foreign countries that is managed on a regional basis.


Commercial Lines Group.

The Commercial Lines Group underwrites general liability and casualty, property, workers'
compensation, commercial auto, inland marine, umbrella and excess liability, and package coverages in the United States. This segment, which generated $1.6 billion of net written premiums in
2001, includes the following business centers:

Small Commercial

provides coverages to small businesses such as retailers, wholesalers, service
companies, professional offices, manufacturers and contractors.

Middle Market Commercial

provides comprehensive property and liability insurance and
risk management services for a wide variety of commercial manufacturing, distributing, retailing and property ownership enterprises where annual insurance costs range from $75,000 to
$1 million. The

Large Accounts

business center serves larger commercial entities that are willing to share in their insurance risk through
significant deductibles and self-insured retentions.

Results
from our participation in insurance pools and associations, which provide specialized underwriting skills and risk management services for the classes of business that they
write, are also included in the Commercial Lines Group segment. These pools and associations serve to increase the underwriting capacity of participating companies for insurance policies where the
concentration of risk is so high or the amount so large that a single company could not prudently accept the entire risk. We limit our participation in these pools and associations.

Surety and Construction.

These operations, which accounted for $991 million of net written premium volume in 2001, are
included in the same segment because of their shared customer based and executive management, as well as the similarity in expertise required to underwrite these coverages. Our Surety operation
underwrites surety bonds, which are agreements under which one party, the surety, guarantees to another party, the owner or obligee, that a third party, the contractor or principal, will perform in
accordance with contractual obligations. The

Contract Surety

business center specializes in providing bid, performance and payment bonds, domestically
and internationally, to a broad spectrum of clients specializing in general contracting, highway and bridge construction, asphalt paving, underground and pipeline construction, manufacturing, civil
and heavy engineering, and mechanical and electrical construction. Bid bonds provide financial assurance that a bid has been submitted in good faith and that the contractor intends to enter into the
contract at the price bid and provide the required performance and payment bonds. Performance bonds protect the obligee from financial loss should the contractor fail to perform the contract in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the contract documents. Payment bonds guarantee that the contractor will pay certain subcontractor, labor and material bills associated with a project. The

Commercial Surety and
Fidelity

business center offers license and permit bonds, court bonds, public official bonds and other miscellaneous bonds. Our
Construction operation provides traditional insurance, and financial and risk management solutions, to a broad range of contractors and owners of construction projects.

According
to data published by the Surety Association of America, our domestic Surety operations were the largest in North America based on 2000 net written premiums, accounting for
approximately 11% of the domestic market. Our Surety operation also includes Afianzadora Insurgentes, the leading surety underwriter in Mexico.

Health Care.

Our Health Care segment, which generated $770 million in net written premium volume in 2001, underwrites
professional liability, property and general liability insurance throughout the entire healthcare delivery system. Products include coverages for healthcare professionals (physicians and surgeons,
dental professionals and nurses); individual healthcare facilities (including hospitals, long-term care facilities and other facilities such as laboratories); and entire systems, such as
hospital networks and managed care systems. Our Health Care segment historically has been one of the leading medical liability insurers in the United States. In the fourth quarter of 2001, after a
strategic review of our Health Care segment led us to conclude that prospects for future profitability were minimal, we announced our intention to exit the medical liability insurance market, subject
to applicable regulatory requirements. We anticipate that net written premium volume in this segment in 2002 will total approximately $400 million, half of which is expected to result from
reporting endorsements. Of the $73 million goodwill write-down that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, $56 million related to goodwill recorded upon our
April 2000 acquisition of MMI Companies, Inc. ("MMI"), an international health care risk services company.

Lloyd's and Other.

Our Lloyd's and Other business segment, which accounted for $608 million of net written premiums in
2001, consists of our operations at Lloyd's, where we provide capital to five underwriting syndicates and own a managing agency; our participation in the insuring of the Lloyd's Central Fund, which is
utilized if an individual member of


Lloyd's
were to be unable to pay its share of a syndicate's losses; and results from MMI's London-based insurance operation, Unionamerica, where the only new business we are underwriting is that which
we are contractually obligated to underwrite through 2004 in two syndicates at Lloyd's. As discussed in more detail on page 3 of this report, at the end of 2001 we announced that we would cease
underwriting certain business through Lloyd's in 2002 and would, when current contractual commitments expire in 2003, end our involvement in the insuring of the Lloyd's Central Fund. We are continuing
to review the role of our operations at Lloyd's in our long-term corporate strategy.

Reinsurance.

Our Reinsurance segment, which generated $1.7 billion of net written premium
volume in 2001, primarily operates under the name "St. Paul Re," which underwrites traditional treaty and facultative reinsurance for property, liability, ocean marine, surety, health and certain
specialty classes of coverages. St. Paul Re also underwrites certain types of "non-traditional" reinsurance, which combines elements of traditional underwriting risk with financial risk
protection to meet specific financial objectives of corporate customers. Reinsurance is an agreement by which an insurance company will pay a premium to transfer, or "cede," a portion of the risk it
has underwritten to a reinsurer. A large portion of reinsurance is effected automatically under general reinsurance contracts known as treaties. In some instances, reinsurance is effected by
negotiation on individual risks, which is referred to as facultative reinsurance. St. Paul Re underwrites traditional reinsurance for leading property, liability and other non-life
insurance companies worldwide, with clients in North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. As discussed in more detail on page 3 of this
report, at the end of 2001 we announced that in 2002 we would narrow the product offerings and geographic presence of our reinsurance operations. We are continuing to review the role of our
reinsurance operations in our long-term corporate strategy.

According
to the most recent data published by the Reinsurance Association of America, St. Paul Re's written premium volume through the first nine months of 2001 ranked it as the
5th-largest reinsurer in the United States. According to data published by Standard & Poor's, St. Paul Re was ranked as the 14th-largest reinsurance group in the world, based on 2000 written
premiums.

Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

Our Primary Insurance Operations in the United States are licensed to transact business in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the
Virgin Islands. At least five percent of our 2001 U.S. property-liability written premiums were produced in each of Illinois, California, Texas and New York.

Our
primary insurance business in the United States is produced primarily through over 5,000 independent insurance agencies and insurance brokers. The needs of agents, brokers and
policyholders are addressed through approximately 160 offices located throughout the United States. Discover Re, a component of our Specialty Commercial segment, underwrites alternative risk transfer
business from its Farmington, CT headquarters, from regional U.S. offices in Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Dallas, Minneapolis and San Francisco, and from a correspondent office in London.

Our
International operations are headquartered in London and, in 2001, underwrote insurance primarily through domestic operations in 14 markets outside the United States (Argentina,
Australia,
Botswana, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Lesotho, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom). As discussed on page 3 of this report, we announced in the
fourth quarter of 2001 that we would cease underwriting primary insurance business in all foreign locations except Canada, the United Kingdom and Ireland in 2002. We will also continue to underwrite
surety business in Mexico.

Through
our involvement at Lloyd's, we have access to insurance markets in virtually every country in the world. At Lloyd's, our managing agency, operating under the name St. Paul
Syndicate Management Ltd., underwrites business for five syndicates in which we are investors, collectively representing approximately 4% of Lloyd's total capacity.

St.
Paul Re underwrites business through brokers and, for certain types of reinsurance and in certain markets, on a direct basis. In 2001, St. Paul Re produced reinsurance business from
its New York headquarters, as well as from offices in London, Brussels, Chicago, Hong Kong, Miami, Morristown NJ, Munich, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. As part of our effort to narrow the geographic
presence of our reinsurance operations, we have ceased underwriting at or intend to close the following offices in 2002: Brussels, Hong Kong, Munich, Singapore and Sydney.


Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

General Information.

When claims are made by or against policyholders, any amounts that our underwriting operations pay or
expect to pay to the claimant are referred to as losses. The costs of investigating, resolving and processing these claims are referred to as loss adjustment expenses ("LAE"). We establish reserves
that reflect the estimated unpaid total cost of these two items. The reserves for unpaid losses and LAE at Dec. 31, 2001 cover claims that were incurred not only in 2001 but also in prior
years. They include estimates of the total cost of claims that have already been reported but not yet settled ("case" reserves), and those that have been incurred but not yet reported ("IBNR"
reserves). Loss reserves are reduced for estimates of salvage and subrogation.

Loss
reserves for tabular workers' compensation business and certain assumed reinsurance contracts are discounted to present value. Additional information about these discounted
liabilities is set forth in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements on pages 45 through 49 of our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, and is incorporated herein by reference. During
2001, $22.2 million of discount was amortized and $3.8 million of additional discount was accrued.

Because
many of the coverages we offer involve claims that may not ultimately be settled for many years after they are incurred, subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to
losses are an integral and necessary component of our loss reserving process. We record our reserves by considering a range
of estimates bounded by a high and low point. Within that range, we record our best estimate. We continually review our reserves, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze
current claim costs, frequency and severity data, and prevailing economic, social and legal factors. We adjust reserves established in prior years as loss experience develops and new information
becomes available. Adjustments to previously estimated reserves are reflected in results in the year in which they are made.

While
our reported reserves make a reasonable provision for all of our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations, it should be noted that the process of estimating required
reserves does, by its very nature, involve uncertainty. The level of uncertainty can be influenced by such factors as the existence of coverages with long duration payment patterns and changes in
claim handling practices. Many of the insurance subsidiaries within The St. Paul's group have written coverages with long duration payment patterns such as medical professional liability, large
deductible workers' compensation and assumed reinsurance. In addition, claim handling practices change and evolve over the years. For example, new initiatives are commenced, claim offices are
reorganized and relocated, claim handling responsibilities of individual adjusters are changed, use of a call center is increased, use of technology is increased, caseload issues and case reserving
practices are monitored more frequently, etc. However, these are sources of uncertainty that we have recognized in establishing our reserves.

Ten-year Development.

The table on page 10 presents a development of net loss and LAE reserve liabilities and
payments for the years 1991 through 2001. The top line on the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE, net of reinsurance recoverables, recorded at the balance sheet date for
each of the years indicated.

The
table excludes the reserves and activity of Economy Fire and Casualty Company and its subsidiaries ("Economy"), which were included in the sale of our standard personal insurance
operations to Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company ("Metropolitan") in 1999. The table does, however, include reserves and activity for the non-Economy standard personal
insurance business that was sold to Metropolitan, since we remain liable for claims on non-Economy standard personal insurance policies that result from losses occurring prior to
Sept. 30, 1999 (the closing date of the sale). Also excluded from the table are the reserves and activity for our nonstandard auto business, which we sold to Prudential Insurance Company of
America in the second quarter of 2000. Notes 9 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements on page 55, and pages 64 through 66, respectively, of our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which
include additional information regarding the sale of these operations and the related reserves, are incorporated herein by reference.

In
1997, we changed the method by which we assign loss activity to a particular year for assumed reinsurance written by our U.K.-based reinsurance operation. Prior to 1997, that loss
activity was assigned to the year in which the underlying reinsurance contract was written. In 1997, our analysis indicated that an excess amount of loss activity was being assigned to


prior
years because of this practice. As a result, we implemented an improved procedure in 1997 that more accurately assigns loss activity for this business to the year in which it occurred. This
change had the impact of increasing favorable development on previously established reserves by approximately $110 million in 1997. There was no net impact on total incurred losses, however,
because there was a corresponding increase in the provision for current year loss activity in 1997. Development data for individual years prior to 1997 in this table were not restated to reflect this
new procedure because reliable data to do so was not available.

The
upper portion of the table, which shows the re-estimated amounts relating to the previously recorded liabilities, is based upon experience as of the end of each
succeeding year. These estimates are either increased or decreased as further information becomes known about individual claims and as changes in the trend of claim frequency and severity become
apparent.

The
"Cumulative redundancy (deficiency)" line on the table for any given year represents the aggregate change in the estimates for all years subsequent to the year the reserves were
initially established. For example, the 1992 net reserve of $13,195 million developed to $12,574 million, or a $621 million redundancy, by the end of 1994. By the end of 2001, the
1992 reserve had developed a redundancy of $1,800 million. The changes in the estimate of 1992 loss reserves were reflected in operations during the past nine years. Likewise, the deficiency
that developed with respect to year-end 2000 reserves (primarily related to our medical liability business) was reflected in our results of operations for 2001.

In
1993, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 113, "Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts." This statement required,
among other things, that reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and LAE be shown as an asset, instead of the prior practice of netting this amount against insurance reserves for balance sheet
reporting purposes.

The
middle portion of the table, which includes data for only those periods impacted since the adoption of SFAS No. 113 (the years 1992 through 2001), represents a reconciliation
between the net reserve liability as shown on the top line of the table and the gross reserve liability as shown on our balance sheet. This portion of the table also presents the gross
re-estimated reserve liability as of the end of the latest re-estimation period (Dec. 31, 2001) and the related re-estimated reinsurance recoverable. We did
not restate data for years prior to 1992 in this table for presentation on a gross basis due to the impracticality of determining such gross data on a reliable basis for our foreign underwriting
operations.

The
lower portion of the table presents the cumulative amounts paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. For example, as of
Dec. 31, 2001, $9,242 million of the currently estimated $11,395 million of net losses and LAE that have been incurred for the years up to and including 1992 have been paid. Thus,
as of Dec. 31, 2001, it is estimated that $2,153 million of net incurred losses and LAE have yet to be paid for the years up to and including 1992.

Caution
should be exercised in evaluating the information shown in this table. It should be noted that each amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods. For
example, the portion of the development shown for year-end 1996 reserves that relates to 1991 losses is included in the cumulative redundancy (deficiency) for the years 1991 through 1996.

In
addition, the table presents calendar year data. It does not present accident or policy year development data, which some readers may be more accustomed to analyzing. The social,
economic and legal conditions and other trends which have had an impact on the changes in the estimated liability in the past are not necessarily indicative of the future. Accordingly, readers are
cautioned against extrapolating any conclusions about future results from the information presented in this table.

Ceded Reinsurance.

Through ceded reinsurance, other insurers and reinsurers agree to share certain risks that
our subsidiaries have underwritten. The purpose of reinsurance is to limit a ceding insurer's maximum net loss arising from large risks or catastrophes. Reinsurance also serves to increase the direct
writing capacity of the ceding insurer. Amounts recoverable on ceded losses are recorded as an asset. In addition, through aggregate excess-of-loss treaties, reinsurance can
serve to reduce the volatility often associated with the results of primary property-liability insurance underwriting entities.

The
collectibility of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of reinsurers. Our Reinsurance Credit Risk Committee, which has established financial standards to determine qualified,
financially secure reinsurers, guides the placement of ceded reinsurance. Generally, uncollectible reinsurance recoverables have not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations,
liquidity or financial position; however, we increased our provision for uncollectible reinsurance by $47 million subsequent to the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attack.

Our
reported results in 2001, 2000 and 1999 included the impact of separate aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties that we entered into effective
January 1 of each year (the "corporate program"). In addition, our Reinsurance segment results in each year benefited from separate aggregate excess-of-loss
reinsurance treaties, unrelated to the corporate program. The combined impact of these treaties on our reported results was as follows:

Property—Liability Investment Operations

Objectives.

Our board of directors approves the overall investment plan for the companies within The St. Paul's
property-liability operations. Each subsidiary develops its own specific investment policy tailored to comply with domestic laws and regulations and the overall corporate investment plan. The primary
objectives of those plans are as follows:

1)

to
maintain a widely diversified fixed maturity portfolio structured to maximize investment returns while generating sufficient liquidity to fund operational cash requirements;

2)

to
minimize credit risk through investments in high-quality instruments; and

3)

to
provide for long-term growth in the market value of the investment portfolio and enhance shareholder value through investments in certain other investment classes, such
as equity securities, venture capital and real estate.

The
following discussion provides more information on each of our invested asset classes.

Fixed Maturities.

Fixed maturities constituted 73% (at cost) of our property-liability insurance operations' investment
portfolio at Dec. 31, 2001. The portfolio is primarily composed of high-quality, intermediate-term taxable U.S. government corporate and mortgage-backed bonds, and
tax-exempt U.S. municipal bonds. The table on the following page presents information about the fixed maturity portfolio for the years 1999 through 2001 (dollars in millions).

We
determine the mix of our taxable and tax-exempt investment purchases based on current and projected corporate tax considerations, and the relationship
between taxable and tax-exempt investment yields at the time of purchase. Taxable, intermediate-term, investment-grade securities accounted for the majority of new bond
purchases in each of the years 2001, 2000 and 1999. We carry our fixed maturities on our balance sheet at their estimated fair value, with unrealized appreciation and depreciation (net of taxes)
recorded in common shareholders' equity.

We
manage our bond portfolio conservatively to provide reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risks. Approximately 95% of the fixed maturities portfolio is rated at investment
grade levels (BBB- or better). The remaining 5% of the portfolio is split between nonrated and non-investment grade (high-yield) securities. We believe the nonrated
securities would be considered investment-grade in quality if rated.

Equities.

Equity securities comprised 5% of the property-liability operations' investments (at cost) at Dec. 31, 2001,
and consist of a diversified portfolio of common stocks, which are held with the primary objective of achieving capital appreciation. Sales of equities generated pretax realized investment losses of
$4 million in 2001, and dividend income totaled $15 million. Equity markets in the United States in 2001 suffered from an economic slowdown and the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. The
portfolio's carrying value at year-end 2001 of $1.1 billion included $52 million of pretax unrealized appreciation.

Real Estate and Mortgage Loans.

Our real estate holdings consist of a diversified portfolio of commercial office and
warehouse properties that we own directly or have partial interest in through joint ventures. The properties are geographically distributed throughout the United States and had an overall occupancy
rate of 95% at Dec. 31, 2001. We also have a portfolio of real estate mortgage investments acquired in our merger with USF&G Corporation in 1998. The real estate and mortgage loan portfolio
produced $115 million of pretax investment income in 2001 and generated $4 million of pretax realized gains.

Venture Capital.

Securities of small- to medium-sized companies spanning a variety of industries comprise our venture capital
holdings, which accounted for 4% of property-liability investments (at cost) at Dec. 31, 2001. These investments are in the form of limited partnership interests or direct
equity investments. Venture capital investments generated pretax realized investment losses of $43 million in 2001. The carrying value of venture capital investments at Dec. 31, 2001
included $93 million of pretax unrealized appreciation.

Securities on Loan.

We participate in a securities lending program whereby certain fixed maturities from our portfolio are
loaned to other institutions for short periods of time. We receive a fee from the borrower in return. We require collateral equal to 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities, and we record the
collateral as a liability. The collateral is invested in short-term securities and reported as such on our balance sheet. At Dec. 31, 2001, collateral invested totaled
$775 million, representing approximately 4% of our total property-liability investments. We retain full ownership of the loaned securities and are indemnified by the lending agent in the event
a borrower becomes insolvent or fails to return the securities.

Short-Term and Other Investments.

Our portfolio also includes short-term securities and other
miscellaneous investments, which in the aggregate comprised 10% of property-liability investments at Dec. 31, 2001.


Derivatives.

Our property-liability investment operations have had limited involvement with derivative financial instruments,
primarily for purposes of hedging against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Effective Jan. 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS)
No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, which required the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance
sheet. Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, which provides more information regarding the impact of adopting SFAS No. 133,
is incorporated herein by reference.

In
addition to Note 8, Notes 1, 6 and 7 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders, also provide additional information
about our investment portfolio and are incorporated herein by reference. The "Investment Operations" and "Exposures to Market Risk" sections of "Management's Discussion and Analysis" in said Annual
Report are also incorporated herein by reference.

Asset Management

The John Nuveen Company ("Nuveen") is our asset management subsidiary. The St. Paul and its largest property-liability insurance subsidiary, St. Paul Fire and
Marine Insurance Company ("Fire and Marine") hold a combined 77% interest in Nuveen.

Nuveen's
principal businesses are asset management and the development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for the affluent,
high-net-worth and institutional market segments. Nuveen distributes its investment products and services, including mutual funds (open-end funds), exchange-traded
funds (closed-end funds), defined portfolios and individual managed accounts to the affluent and high-net-worth market segments through unaffiliated intermediary
firms, broker-dealers, commercial banks, affiliates of insurance providers, financial planners, accountants, consultants and investment advisors. Nuveen also provides investment products and services
to institutional markets.

Nuveen's
primary business activities generate three principal sources of revenue: (1) ongoing advisory fees earned on assets under management, including individually managed
accounts, mutual funds and exchange-traded funds; (2) distribution revenues earned upon the sale of certain investment products; and (3) fees earned on certain institutional accounts
based on the performance of such accounts.

Nuveen's
operations are organized around nine subsidiaries, including Nuveen Investments, a registered broker and dealer in securities under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and six
investment advisory subsidiaries registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The six investment advisory subsidiaries are Nuveen Advisory Corp. ("NAC"), Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp.
("NIAC"), Nuveen Asset Management Inc. ("NAM"), Rittenhouse Financial Services, Inc. ("Rittenhouse"), Nuveen Senior Loan Asset Management, Inc. ("NSLAM") and Symphony Asset
Management LLC ("Symphony"). Nuveen Investments provides investment product distribution and related services for Nuveen's managed funds and defined portfolios. NAC, NIAC and NSLAM provide investment
management services for and administer the business affairs of the Nuveen managed funds. Rittenhouse and NAM provide investment management services for individually managed accounts, and Rittenhouse
also acts as sub-adviser and portfolio manager for a mutual fund managed by NIAC. Symphony, acquired in July 2001 for a total cost of approximately $208 million, provides
managed accounts and investment funds designed to reduce risk through market-neutral and other strategies in several equity and fixed-income asset classes for institutional investors. The other two
subsidiaries are not registered broker-dealers or investment advisors.

At
Dec. 31, 2001, Nuveen's assets under management totaled $68.5 billion, consisting of $32.0 billion of exchange-traded funds, $24.7 billion of managed
accounts, and $11.8 billion of mutual funds. Municipal securities accounted for approximately 70% of the underlying managed assets.


Competition and Regulation

The financial services industry in general continues to be affected by an intensifying competitive environment, as demonstrated by consolidation through mergers
and acquisitions and competition from new entrants, as well as established competitors using new technologies, including the Internet, to establish or expand their businesses. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act, passed in 1999, which repealed U.S. laws that separated commercial banking, investment banking and insurance activities, together with
changes to the industry resulting from previous reforms, has increased the number of companies competing for a similar customer base.

Property-Liability Insurance.

Our domestic and international underwriting subsidiaries compete with a large number of other
insurers and reinsurers. In addition, many large commercial customers self-insure their risks or utilize large deductibles on purchased insurance. Our subsidiaries compete principally by
attempting to offer a combination of superior products, underwriting expertise and services at a competitive, yet profitable, price. The combination of products, services, pricing and other methods of
competition varies by line of insurance and by coverage within each line of insurance.

The
St. Paul and our underwriting subsidiaries are subject to regulation by certain states as an insurance holding company system. Such regulation generally provides that transactions
between companies within the holding company system must be fair and equitable. Transfers of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from underwriting subsidiaries and
certain material transactions between companies within the system may be subject to prior notice to, or prior approval by, state regulatory authorities. During 2001, we received dividends in the form
of cash and securities of $827 million from our U.S. underwriting subsidiaries. Although $414 million will be available for dividends in 2002, business and regulatory considerations may
impact the amount of dividends actually paid. We do not anticipate the receipt of any dividends from our U.S. underwriting subsidiaries in 2002. We have sufficient resources available at the parent
company to fund common and preferred shareholder dividends, interest payments and distributions on preferred securities, respectively, and other administrative expenses.

Any
change of control (generally presumed by the holding company laws to occur with the acquisition of 10% or more of an insurance holding company's voting securities) of The St. Paul
and its underwriting subsidiaries is subject to prior approval by regulators.

Our
underwriting subsidiaries are subject to licensing and supervision by government regulatory agencies in the jurisdictions in which they do business. The nature and extent of such
regulation vary but generally have their source in statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to insurance regulators, which in the U.S. are state authorities. Such
regulation, supervision and administration of the underwriting subsidiaries may relate, among other things, to the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and
their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; restrictions on the size of risk which may be insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;
regulation of policy forms and premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for
other purposes; requirements regarding reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other matters; the nature of and limitations on dividends to policyholders and shareholders; the nature and extent of
required participation in insurance guaranty funds; and the involuntary assumption of hard-to-place or high-risk insurance business, primarily in workers'
compensation insurance lines. In addition, the terms and conditions of our plan to exit the medical liability insurance market in 2002 are subject to regulatory approval in several states.

Loss
ratio trends in property-liability insurance underwriting experience may be improved by, among other things, changing the kinds of coverages provided by policies, providing loss
prevention and risk management services, increasing premium rates, purchasing reinsurance or by a combination of these
factors. The ability of our insurance underwriting subsidiaries to meet emerging adverse underwriting trends may be delayed, from time to time, by the effects of laws which require prior approval by
insurance regulatory authorities of changes in policy forms and premium rates. Our U.S. underwriting operations do business in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the
U.S. Virgin Islands. Many of these jurisdictions require prior approval of most or all premium rates.


Our
insurance underwriting business in the United Kingdom is regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The FSA's principal objectives are to ensure that insurance companies
are responsibly managed, that they have adequate funds to meet liabilities to policyholders and that they maintain required levels of solvency. In Canada, the conduct of insurance business is
regulated under provisions of the Insurance Companies Act of 1992, which requires insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on the type and amount of insurance policies in
force. The Lloyd's operation is currently regulated by the Council of Lloyd's, a self-regulatory organization, which will in due course be regulated by the FSA. We are also subject to
regulations in the other countries and jurisdictions in which we underwrite insurance business. The terms and conditions of our plans to cease underwriting operations in selected foreign countries are
subject to regulatory approval in several of those countries.

Asset Management.

Nuveen is subject to substantial competition in all aspects of its business. Investment products are sold
to the public and institutions by broker-dealers, banks, insurance companies and others. Nuveen competes with other providers of products primarily on the basis of the range of products offered, the
investment performance of such products, quality of service, fees charged, the level and type of broker compensation, the manner in which such products are marketed and distributed, and the services
provided to investors.

Nuveen
is a publicly-traded company registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and listed on the New York Stock Exchange. One of its subsidiaries, Nuveen Investments, is a
broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and is subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
and other federal and state agencies and self-regulatory organizations. It is also subject to net capital requirements that restrict its ability to pay dividends. Six of Nuveen's other
subsidiaries are investment advisers registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. As such, they are subject to regulation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Paul International Insurance Company Ltd. owns a building in London, England, which houses a portion of its operations. We retained ownership of another building in London
subsequent to the sale of Minet Holdings plc to Aon Corporation in 1997, which is being leased to an outside party. In a transaction completed in March 2001, we sold a 50% interest in this
building.

Fire
and Marine and its subsidiary, St. Paul Properties, Inc., own a portfolio of income-producing properties in various locations across the United States that they have
purchased for investment.

Our
operating subsidiaries rent or lease office space in most cities in which they operate.

Management
considers the currently owned and leased office facilities of The St. Paul and its subsidiaries adequate for the current and anticipated future level of operations.

Item 3. Legal Proceedings.

The information set forth in the "Legal Matters" section of Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements, and the "Environmental and Asbestos Claims"
section of "Management's Discussion and
Analysis," which are included in our 2001 Annual Report to Shareholders on pages 66 and 67, and 31 and 32, respectively, are incorporated herein by reference.

In
1990, at the direction of the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), five insurance underwriting subsidiaries of London United Investments PLC (LUI) suspended underwriting new
insurance business. At the same time, four of those subsidiaries, being insolvent, suspended payment of claims and have since been placed in provisional liquidation. The fifth subsidiary, Walbrook
Insurance Company, continued paying claims until May of 1992 but has now also been placed in provisional insolvent liquidation. Weavers Underwriting Agency (Weavers), an LUI subsidiary, managed these
insurers. Minet, a former insurance brokerage subsidiary of ours, had brokered business to and from Weavers for many years. From 1973 through 1980, our UK-based underwriting operations,
now called St. Paul International Insurance Company Ltd. (SPI), had accepted business from Weavers. A portion of that business was ceded by SPI to reinsurers. Certain of those reinsurers have
challenged the validity of certain reinsurance contracts (or the amount of recovery thereunder) relating to the Weavers pool, of which SPI was a member, in an attempt to avoid liability under those
contracts. SPI and other members of the Weavers pool are seeking enforcement of the reinsurance contracts. Minet may also become the subject of legal proceedings arising from its role as one of the
major brokers for Weavers. When we sold Minet in May 1997, we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for most of Minet's then existing liabilities, including liabilities relating to the Weavers
matter. We will vigorously contest any proceedings relating to the Weavers matter. We recognize that the final outcome of these proceedings, if adverse to us, may materially impact the results of
operations in the period in which that outcome occurs. We believe that such an adverse outcome, however, will not have a materially adverse effect on our liquidity or overall financial position.

Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security Holders.

No matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2001.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS' REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES

The Board of Directors and Shareholders

The St. Paul Companies, Inc.:

Under
date of January 23, 2002, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of The St. Paul Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders' equity, comprehensive income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2001,
as contained in the 2001 annual report to shareholders. These consolidated financial statements and our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the annual report on
Form 10-K for the year 2001. In connection with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements we also have audited the related financial statement schedules I
through V, as listed in the index in Item 14(a)2 of said Form 10-K. These financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on these financial statement schedules based on our audits.

In

fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As
discussed in Notes 1 and 8 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the Company adopted the provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities" and, as also described in Note 1, in 1999 the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Position No. 97-3,
