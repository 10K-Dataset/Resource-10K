PART I

Item 1.

Business.

General Description

The St. Paul Companies,
Inc. (“The St. Paul”) is incorporated as a general business corporation under
the laws of the State of Minnesota.  The
St. Paul and its subsidiaries constitute one of the oldest insurance
organizations in the United States, dating back to 1853.  We are a management company principally
engaged, through our subsidiaries, in providing commercial property-liability
insurance products and services.  We
also have a presence in the asset management industry through our 79% majority
ownership of Nuveen Investments, Inc. 
As a management company, we oversee the operations of our subsidiaries
and provide them with capital, management and administrative services.  At March 1, 2003, The St. Paul and its
subsidiaries employed approximately 9,700 persons.  Based on total revenues in 2001, we ranked No. 218 on the

Fortune 500

list of the largest companies in the United States.  Our Internet website address is stpaul.com.  We make available, free of charge, on or
through our website, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form
10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or
furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such
material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Our website address is an inactive textual
reference only and the contents of the website are not part of this report.

Summary of Results

The following table
summarizes The St. Paul’s consolidated results for each of the years in the
three-year period ended December 31, 2002.

Our pretax income from
continuing operations of $176 million in 2002 included a $472 million loss
provision, net of reinsurance, related to a settlement agreement we entered
into with respect to the Western MacArthur asbestos litigation (described in
more detail on page 4 of this report). 
In 2001, our pretax loss of $1.43 billion was dominated by $941 million
of pretax losses resulting from the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack and
pretax provisions totaling $735 million to strengthen prior-year loss reserves
in our Health Care segment.  Excluding
the Western MacArthur loss, the losses from the terrorist attack and the 2001 loss
provision in the Health Care segment, our pretax income in 2002 of $648 million
was significantly better than 2001 pretax income of $245 million, primarily due
to strong improvement in underwriting results in our ongoing property-liability
business segments.  Our majority-owned
asset management subsidiary, Nuveen Investments, Inc., achieved another year of
record results, driven by strong product sales and recent strategic
acquisitions.  The pretax loss in the
“Parent company and other operations” category (which primarily consists of
management, administrative and debt service expenses at the holding company
level) exceeded the comparable loss in 2001 primarily due to an increase in
distributions related to preferred securities issued in the fourth quarter of
2001.


In the fourth quarter of
2002, we revised our segment reporting structure in our property-liability
underwriting operations.  Our ongoing
operations are now reported in four segments, and the operations we consider to
be in runoff are reported in three segments. 
In our ongoing segments, written premium volume of $5.89 billion in 2002
grew 22% over comparable 2001 volume of $4.84 billion, driven by strong price
increases throughout these segments in addition to new business in many of
those operations.  In our runoff
segments, premium volume of $1.16 billion in 2002 was 60% less than 2001
written premiums of $2.93 billion, reflecting the impact of our decision to
exit those operations.

The following discussion
summarizes major transactions or events that occurred in 2002.

Transfer of Ongoing Reinsurance Operations to Platinum
Underwriters Holdings, Ltd.

In November 2002, we
completed the transfer of our ongoing reinsurance business (previously
operating under the name “St. Paul Re”) to Platinum Underwriters Holdings, Ltd.
(“Platinum”), a newly formed Bermuda company that underwrites property and
casualty reinsurance on a worldwide basis. 
As part of this transaction, we contributed $122 million of cash
to Platinum and transferred $349 million in assets relating to the insurance
reserves that we also transferred.  In
exchange, we acquired six million common shares, representing a 14% equity
ownership interest in Platinum, and a ten-year option to buy up to six million
additional common shares at an exercise price of $27 per share, which
represents 120% of the initial public offering price of Platinum’s shares.  The transaction resulted in a pretax gain of
$29 million and an after-tax loss of $54 million.  The after-tax loss was driven by the write-off of approximately
$73 million in deferred tax assets associated with previously incurred losses
related to St. Paul Re’s United Kingdom-based operations, as well as
approximately $10 million in taxes associated with the pretax gain.  The “Transfer of Ongoing Reinsurance
Operations to Platinum Underwriters Holdings, Ltd.” section of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis on page 24 of our 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders
contains further information about the Platinum transaction and is incorporated
herein by reference.

Asbestos Settlement Agreement

.  On June 3, 2002, we announced that we and
certain of our subsidiaries had entered into an agreement settling all existing
and future claims arising from any insuring relationship of United States
Fidelity and Guaranty Company (“USF&G”), St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance
Company (“Fire and Marine”) and their affiliates and subsidiaries, including
us, with any of MacArthur Company, Western MacArthur Company (“Western
MacArthur”), and Western Asbestos Company (“Western Asbestos”) (together, the
“MacArthur Companies”).  The pretax
impact on our 2002 results, net of expected reinsurance recoveries and the
re-evaluation and application of asbestos and environmental reserves, was
approximately $472 million ($307 million after-tax).  We made payments of $235 million in June 2002 and $740 million in
January 2003 related to the settlement agreement.  The “Asbestos Settlement Agreement” section of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis on pages 27 and 28 of our 2002 Annual Report to
Shareholders contains further details about this settlement agreement and is
incorporated herein by reference.

Issuance of Common Stock and Equity Units.

In July 2002, we sold 17.8 million of our
common shares in a public offering for gross consideration of $431 million, or
$24.20 per share.  In a separate
concurrent public offering, we sold 8.9 million equity units, each having a
stated amount of $50, for gross consideration of $443 million.  Each equity unit initially consists of a
three-year forward purchase contract for our common stock and our unsecured $50
senior note due in August 2007.  Total
annual distributions on the equity units are at the rate of 9.00%, consisting
of interest on the note at a rate of 5.25% and fee payments under the forward
contract of 3.75%.  The forward contract
requires the investor to purchase, for $50, a variable number of shares of our
common stock on the settlement date of August 16, 2005.  The $46 million present value of the forward
contract fee payments was recorded as a reduction to our reported common
shareholders’ equity.  The number of
shares to be purchased will be determined based on a formula that considers the
average trading price of the stock immediately prior to the time of settlement
in relation to the $24.20 per share price at the time of the offering.  Had the settlement date been December 31,
2002, we would have issued approximately 15 million common shares based on the
average trading price of our common stock immediately prior to that date.

The combined net proceeds
of these offerings, after underwriting commissions and other fees and expenses,
were approximately $842 million, of which $750 million was contributed as
capital to our insurance underwriting subsidiaries.


Consolidated Revenues

The following table
summarizes the sources of our consolidated revenues from continuing operations
for each of the years 2000 through 2002. 
Following the table is a narrative description of each of our business
segments.  Additional financial
information about revenues and pretax income or losses attributable to each of
our business segments is set forth in Note 21 to our consolidated financial
statements included on pages 86 through 88 of our 2002 Annual Report to
Shareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.  All data for 2001 and 2000 in the following
table are presented on a basis consistent with our new segment reporting
structure implemented in the fourth quarter of 2002 and described in more
detail following the table.

Narrative Description of Business

Property-Liability Insurance

In the fourth quarter of
2002, we revised our property-liability business segment reporting structure to
reflect the manner in which those businesses are currently managed, including
in recognition of certain operations being separately managed as runoff
operations.

As of December 31, 2002,
our property-liability underwriting operations consisted of four segments
constituting our ongoing operations, and three segments comprising our runoff
operations.  We retained the concept of
a “specialty commercial” business center, which is an operation possessing
dedicated underwriting, claims and risk control services requiring specialized
expertise and focusing exclusively on the customers it serves.  Eleven of those business centers comprise
our

Specialty Commercial

reportable segment.  In addition to our
underwriting segments, we have an investment operations segment responsible for
administering and overseeing our property-liability investment portfolio.


The following is a
summary of the changes made to our reporting segments at the end of 2002.

•

In
our

Specialty Commercial

segment,
all international specialty business that had either been included in
respective business centers, or had been included in the separate

International Specialty

business center,
was reclassified to the newly formed

International
& Lloyd’s

segment (for ongoing operations) or our

Other

segment (for international
operations considered to be in runoff).

•

All
international health care business, previously included in the

Health Care

segment, was reclassified to
the newly formed

Other

segment.

•

The

International & Lloyd’s

segment was formed, comprised of our ongoing operations at Lloyd’s, ongoing
specialty commercial business underwritten outside the United States (currently
consisting of operations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the Republic of
Ireland), including our Global Accounts business center.  All operations in this segment are under
common management.

•

The
new runoff segment

Other

was
formed, comprised of all of our international and Lloyd’s business considered
to be in runoff (including our involvement in insuring the Lloyd’s Central
Fund), as well as Unionamerica, the U.K.-based underwriting entity we acquired
in our purchase of MMI Companies, Inc. in 2000.

•

Our

Catastrophe Risk

business center,
previously included in the

Specialty
Commercial

segment in its entirety, was split into two operations,
with

Personal Catastrophe Risk

remaining in the

Specialty Commercial

segment and

Commercial Catastrophe Risk

moving
to the

Commercial Lines

segment
as part of the

Property Solutions

business center.

Our business segments
underwrite property and liability insurance and provide insurance-related
products and services to commercial and professional customers throughout the
United States and in selected international markets.  In the United States, our largest primary insurance underwriting
subsidiary is Fire and Marine.  The
primary sources of property-liability revenues are premiums earned from
insurance policies and reinsurance contracts, income earned from the investment
portfolio and gains from sales of investments. 
According to the most recent industry statistics published in “Best’s
Review” with respect to commercial lines property-liability insurers doing
business in the United States, our property-liability underwriting operations
ranked as the fourth-largest on the basis of 2001 direct written premiums.

Principal Departments and Products

In general, our property-liability
insurance operations underwrite the following types, or “lines,” of property
and liability coverages.

•

general
liability, which provides coverage for liability exposures including personal
injury and property damage arising from general business operations, products
sold and completed work;

•

liability
coverages for corporations and nonprofit organizations, including their
directors and officers, and for a variety of professionals such as lawyers,
insurance agents and real estate agents;

•

property
insurance, which insures tangible property for loss, damage or loss of use;

•

commercial
multi-peril, which provides a combination of property coverage (for damages
such as those caused by fire, wind, hail, water, theft, and vandalism) and
liability coverage (for third-party liability from accidents occurring on the
insureds’ premises or arising out of their operations);

•

commercial
auto, which provides coverage for businesses against losses resulting from
their ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks, including losses
resulting from bodily injury to third parties, physical damage to an insured’s
vehicle and property damage to other vehicles and other property;


•

workers’
compensation, which provides coverage for employers for specified benefits payable
under state or federal law for workplace injuries, disabilities or death to
employees, without regard to fault;

•

inland
marine, which provides coverage for property which is generally mobile in
nature, such as contractors’ equipment or cargo being shipped by truck or rail,
as well as instrumentalities of transportation or communication such as
bridges, tunnels and computers, and certain property risks such as builders’
risk;

•

contract
surety bonds and commercial surety bonds; and

•

umbrella
coverages, which provide specified layers of coverage on accounts where we do
not provide the primary liability coverage.

Further information about
these lines of business, including types of coverage that are specific to an
operating segment, are included in the segment descriptions that follow this
section.

Through one or more lines
underwritten by our business segments, including property and general
liability, we are exposed to losses from environmental claims and mold
claims.  Environmental claims include
claims of liability for alleged damage from hazardous or toxic materials.  The majority of our general liability
policies include an absolute pollution exclusion; however, in several business
centers, particularly

Oil and Gas

and

Umbrella/Excess & Surplus Lines

in
our Specialty Commercial segment, we continue to underwrite new business with
limited pollution coverage.  Under
certain policies we underwrite, we are exposed to losses from claims of mold
and moisture infiltration, which can cause personal injury and damage to
property.  Certain policyholders have
submitted claims to us under their property and general liability polices that
include damages related to the presence of mold.  Predominantly, these mold claims are for property damage
submitted under a first-party property policy, or for construction defect
third-party liability submitted under a general liability policy.  Few personal injury claims related to mold
under workers’ compensation or general liability policies have been submitted
to us.  The cause and type of damage of
each property damage or bodily injury incident involving mold determines
whether the claim may be a covered loss under a property policy or if there is
a duty to defend and/or indemnify an insured in a third-party claim.

In
addition, we have exposure to claims arising from the use of asbestos in
building materials and construction. . 
The “Environmental and Asbestos Claims” section of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis included on pages 48 and 49 of our 2002 Annual Report to
Shareholders, which includes a discussion of our historical exposure to and
losses from asbestos and environmental claims, is incorporated herein by
reference.

The “Underwriting Results
by Segment” table in Management’s Discussion and Analysis included on page 36
of our 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders, which summarizes written premiums,
underwriting results, statutory combined ratios and adjusted combined ratios
(as described in the footnote to the table) for each of our underwriting
segments for the last three years, is incorporated herein by reference.  The following discussion provides more
information about the structure of, and products offered by, our
property-liability insurance underwriting segments.

Ongoing
Business Segments

Specialty Commercial

.

This segment consists of business centers that we have designated
specialty commercial operations because each provides dedicated underwriting,
claim and risk control services that require specialized expertise, and each
focuses exclusively on the respective customers it serves.  Insurance coverage is often provided on
proprietary insurance forms.  Those
business centers, which collectively generated $1.99 billion of net written
premiums in 2002 (accounting for 34% of our ongoing segments’ premium volume
and 28% of our consolidated written premium volume) and operate exclusively in
the United States, are as follows.

Financial
& Professional Services

provides property and liability
coverages for financial institutions, professional liability and management
liability coverages for corporations and nonprofit organizations against losses
caused by the negligence or misconduct of named directors and officers, and
errors and omissions coverages for a variety of professionals such as lawyers,
insurance agents and real estate agents for liability from errors and omissions


committed in the course
of professional conduct or practice. 
Although we have not observed any notable increase in directors and
officers claims in this business center, in view of recent allegations of
corporate malfeasance and professional misconduct, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (and regulations issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to that law), and the general decline in the securities markets, the frequency
and severity of such claims could increase.

Technology

offers a portfolio of specialty products and services to companies involved in
telecommunications, information technology, health sciences and electronics
manufacturing.   These products include
property, commercial auto, general liability, workers’ compensation, umbrella,
Internet liability, and technology errors and omissions coverages.  The services provided by this business
center include dedicated underwriting, risk control and specialized claim
handling.

Umbrella/Excess & Surplus Lines

consists
of three distinct business units.  The

Specialty Excess and Umbrella

unit focuses
on umbrella and excess liability business for retail agents and brokers, where
other insurance companies are providing the primary coverage.  The coverages underwritten are typically
commercial auto, general liability and product liability.  Umbrella coverage may also be underwritten
over a company that retains risk or has a self-insured retention, instead of a
scheduled underlying policy.  The

Excess & Surplus Lines

unit
underwrites non-admitted individual risk business for established wholesale
distributors.  The coverages typically
underwritten include commercial auto, general liability and product
liability.  The

E&S Underwriting Facilities

unit
underwrites liability and property facilities produced by wholesalers and
managing general agents, which are licensed insurance agents that manage all or
part of an insurer’s customers with unique requirements - primarily those with
moderate to high hazard exposures requiring expertise in the surplus lines
marketplace and the ability to use policy forms not subject to regulatory
requirements.  Coverages include
property, commercial auto, general liability and a small amount of umbrella.

Public
Sector Services

markets insurance products and services to
municipalities, counties, Indian Nation gaming and selected special government
districts, including water and sewer utilities, and non-rail transit
authorities.  The policies written by
this business center typically cover property, commercial auto, general
liability, workers’ compensation and errors and omissions exposures.

Discover Re

, which principally provides
commercial auto liability, general liability, workers’ compensation, and
property coverages, serves retail brokers and insureds that are committed to
the alternative risk transfer (ART) market. 
Alternative risk transfer techniques are typically utilized by
sophisticated insureds that are financially able to assume a substantial
portion of their own losses.

Discover Re

is organized in two underwriting units, each of which underwrites primary
insurance in connection with arrangements that involve the client or a captive
insurer agreeing to bear much of the covered risk.  The individual risk unit markets products to individual insureds
that are comfortable retaining the more predictable layer of their expected
losses, whether it be a large deductible or a true self-insured retention.  Under a large deductible structure we are
exposed not only to the risk of loss under the policy but also to the risk of
the insured’s inability or unwillingness to pay its obligations under the terms
of the agreement.  We mitigate the
latter risk by collateralizing all or a portion of the expected losses in the
insured’s retained layer.  The second
underwriting unit is the captive/program unit, which focuses on captive
business.  Similar to the individual
risk accounts, the captives retain the more predictable frequency layer of
expected losses, with

Discover Re

providing excess coverage
above the captives’ retention.  In some
instances the captive/program unit may retain little or no risk, but earns
revenues primarily from fees collected for providing access to policies from an
admitted insurance company.


Specialty
Programs

underwrites insurance programs for selected
industries that are national in scope and have similar risk characteristics,
including franchises and associations in the entertainment, rental, propane,
and rural electric industries.  Specific
lines of insurance written by these business centers include property,
commercial auto, general liability, workers’ compensation, inland marine, errors
and omissions, umbrella and fidelity. 
Underwriting guidelines, premiums and policy forms issued by this
business segment vary by program and by jurisdiction because of local market
conditions and legal requirements. 
Coverage may be on a primary or an excess basis, depending on how the
coverage is structured for a particular insured.  Because of the national scope of the programs written by this
business center, we may be exposed to unusually large losses if a single
industry whose members are insured through an association is adversely affected
by a major event or development, to the extent that the event or development
causes losses throughout the industry.

Oil and Gas

provides specialized property and liability products for customers involved in
the exploration and production of oil and gas including operators, drillers and
servicing contractors.  The policies
written by this business center insure drilling rigs, natural gas facilities,
pipelines, production and gathering platforms, and cover risks including
physical damage, liability and business interruption.

Ocean
Marine

underwrites a diverse portfolio of coverages for all
forms of marine transportation and the companies that serve them, as well as
other businesses involved in international trade.  Our product offerings fall under four main coverage
categories:  marine liability; cargo;
hull and machinery, protection and indemnity; and marine property-liability.

Personal
Catastrophe Risk

underwrites personal property coverages in
certain states exposed to earthquakes and hurricanes, including principally
California and Florida.  As with our
commercial catastrophe risk coverages underwritten in our Commercial Lines
segment, a single loss event may produce heavy losses under a number of
policies.  We attempt to manage the risk
to which we are exposed through natural catastrophe reinsurance coverage.  The “Natural Catastrophe Risk Management”
section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis included on page 26 of our 2002
Annual Report to Shareholders, which includes a discussion of our natural
catastrophe risk management procedures, is incorporated herein by reference.

Commercial Lines

.

This segment generated $1.83 billion of net written premiums in
2002 (accounting for 31% of our ongoing segments’ premium volume and 26% of our
consolidated written premium volume).

The Commercial Lines
segment includes our

Small Commercial

,

Middle Market Commercial

and

Property Solutions

business centers, as
well as the results of our limited involvement in insurance pools.

Small
Commercial

services commercial firms that typically have between one
and fifty employees through its proprietary St. Paul Mainstreet

(SM)

and
St. Paul Advantage

(SM)

products, with a particular focus on offices,
wholesalers, retailers, artisan contractors and other service risks.

The

Middle Market Commercial

business center
offers insurance coverages for a wide variety of manufacturing, wholesale,
service and retail enterprises for which annual insurance costs typically range
from $75,000 to $1 million.  This
business center also offers loss-sensitive casualty programs, including
significant deductible and self-insured retention options, for the higher end
of the middle market sector.

The

Property
Solutions

business center combines our Large Account Property
business with the commercial portion of our catastrophe risk business and
allows us to take a unified approach to large commercial property risks.  Large Accounts are typically those with
property premiums greater than $100,000. 
This business center focuses on underwriting property coverages for real
properties exposed to light to moderate hazards, such as hotels and office
buildings, rather than high hazard properties such as petrochemical, mining and
other basic process industries.  Many of
the products underwritten by this business center are structured products, in
which we write coverage for a specified layer of risk and other insurers
underwrite other layers.  Because this
business center includes our previous commercial catastrophe risk business,
some of the policies underwritten by it expose us to catastrophe risk,
principally earthquake and hurricane, in which a single loss event can produce
heavy losses under a number of policies. 
The structuring, or layering, of risk as described above results in our
being less exposed (before the effect of reinsurance) to such


catastrophe risk than if we wrote traditional full
limits property policies.  To further
manage our risk, we purchase reinsurance coverage for catastrophe
exposures.  Our efforts to manage the
risk to which we are exposed from natural catastrophe coverage, which are
described in the “Natural Catastrophe Risk Management” section of Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, is incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K at Item
7.  In November 2002, President Bush
signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002.  A description of the provisions of this Act,
and their potential impact on us, is included in the “Terrorism Risk and
Legislation” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis included on pages
25 and 26 of our 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

Results from our
participation in insurance pools and associations, which provide specialized
underwriting skills and risk management services for the classes of business
that they underwrite, are also included in the Commercial Lines segment. These
pools and associations serve to increase the underwriting capacity of participating
companies for insurance policies where the concen­tration of risk is so high or
the amount at risk is so large that a single company could not prudently accept
the entire risk. We limit our participation in these pools and associations.

Surety & Construction

.  We consider our Surety & Construction
segment a specialty operation, because each business requires specialized
underwriting, risk management and claim expertise.  These operations, which accounted for $1.27 billion of net
written premium volume in 2002 (accounting for 22% of our ongoing segments’
premium volume and 18% of our consolidated written premium volume), are
included in the same segment because of their shared customer base and
executive management, as well as the similarity in expertise required to
underwrite these coverages.

According to data
published by the Surety Association of America, our domestic surety operations
were the second largest in the United States based on 2001 direct premiums
written.  In addition to its U.S. operations,
our Surety business center also includes Afianzadora Insurgentes, the leading
surety underwriter in Mexico, and our Canadian operations, St. Paul Guarantee
and Northern Indemnity, which, on a combined basis, make us the largest surety
bond underwriter in Canada.

Our

Surety

business center underwrites surety
bonds, which are agreements under which one party (the surety) guarantees to
another party (the owner or obligee) that a third party (the contractor or
principal) will perform in accordance with contractual or legal
obligations.  The surety is responsible
for evaluating the risk to be covered and for determining if the principal
meets the underwriting requirements for the bond.  The premium charged will reflect the size and type of the
obligation.  By offering a bond, the
surety is offering assurance that its customer will meet its obligations as
specified under the bond.

Our surety business
center was expanded by our March 2002 acquisition of St. Paul Guarantee in
Canada (formerly London Guarantee), and our acquisition in late 2001 of the
right to seek to renew surety business previously underwritten by Fireman’s
Fund Insurance Company.

For

Contract Surety

, we provide bid,
performance and payment bonds to a broad spectrum of clients specializing in
general contracting, highway and bridge construction, asphalt paving,
underground and pipeline construction, manufacturing, civil and heavy
engineering, and mechanical and electrical construction.  Bid bonds provide financial assurance that
bids have been submitted in good faith and that the contractor intends to enter
into the contract at the price bid and provide the required performance and
payment bonds.  Performance bonds
require us to fulfill the contractor’s obligations to the obligee should the contractor
fail to perform under the contract. 
Payment bonds guarantee that the contractor will pay certain
subcontractor, labor and material bills associated with a project.

For

Commercial Surety

, which comprises bonds
covering obligations often required by law, the bonds that we currently
underwrite are as follows.

•

license
and permit bonds, which are required by statutes or regulations for a number of
purposes, including guaranteeing the payment of certain taxes and fees and
providing consumer protection as a condition to granting licenses related to
selling real estate, including tax and customs bonds;

•

reclamation
bonds, which cover reclamation costs for mining and other industrial companies;


•

fiduciary
bonds, which are required by statutes, courts or contracts for the protection
of those on whose behalf a fiduciary (such as an executor of an estate or a
guardian of a minor) acts, including probate bonds and depository bonds;

•

court
bonds, which are bonds that may be required of either a plaintiff or a
defendant in a lawsuit;

•

public
official bonds, which are required by statutes and regulations to guarantee the
lawful and faithful performance of the duties of office by public officials;

•

indemnity
bonds, which are obligations to hold a third party harmless of damages related
to an underlying obligation to perform, maintain or pay;

•

workers’
compensation self-insurer bonds, which are required by statutes and regulations
to guarantee the payment of workers’ compensation benefits to injured workers
of companies that wish to self-insure those obligations;

•

transfer
agent indemnity bonds, which protect the issuer of securities and the transfer
agent against the possibility that a lost share certificate may be presented
later by an innocent purchaser for value; and

•

other
miscellaneous bonds.

Like contract surety
bonds, commercial surety bonds expose us to the risk that the principal - e.g.,
the fiduciary in a fiduciary bond or the mining company in a reclamation bond -
will not perform the duties required by the contract, applicable law or
regulation.  Accordingly, we underwrite
and price these products by analyzing, among other things, the principal’s
creditworthiness and ability to perform.

Certain sectors of our
commercial surety business tend to be characterized by low frequency but
potentially high severity losses.  In
October 2000, we made a strategic decision to significantly reduce the
exposures in these sectors.  Since that
time, we had reduced our total commercial surety gross open bond exposure by
over 40% by December 31, 2002.

Within these sectors of
our commercial surety business, we have exposures related to a small number of
accounts, which are in various stages of bankruptcy proceedings.  In addition, certain other accounts have
experienced deterioration in creditworthiness since we issued bonds to
them.  Given the current economic
climate and its impact on these companies, we may experience an increase in
claims and, possibly, incur high severity losses.  Such losses would be recognized in the period in which the claims
are filed and determined to be a valid loss under the provisions of the surety
bond issued.


We continue with our
intention to exit the segments of the commercial surety market discussed above
that are characterized by low frequency but potentially high severity bonds by
ceasing to write new business and, where possible, terminating the outstanding
bonds.  We continue to be a market for
traditional commercial surety business, which includes low-limit business such
as license and permit, probate, public official, and customs bonds.

Our

Construction

business center offers a
variety of products and services, including traditional insurance, consisting
of workers’ compensation, general liability and commercial auto coverages, and
other risk management solutions, to a broad range of contractors and parties
responsible for construction projects.

International & Lloyd’s

.

Following the realignment of our business
segments in the fourth quarter of 2002, our

International
& Lloyd’s

segment, which accounted for $808 million of net
written premium volume in 2002 (accounting for 14% of our ongoing segments’
premium volume and 11% of our consolidated written premium volume), consists of
our ongoing operations at Lloyd’s, and our ongoing specialty commercial
operations outside of the United States, including our

Global Underwriting

business center
(collectively referred to hereafter as “international specialties”).

Lloyd’s is a subscription
insurance market in which member individuals and firms participate to provide
insurance to customers seeking coverage for a variety of risks.  The members of Lloyd’s are organized into
“syndicates” consisting of one or more members.  The members provide underwriting capacity with which the
syndicate makes coverage available to particular customers.  Syndicates are operated by managing agencies
that receive fees in respect of the services they provide in both underwriting
and claims administration.  Coverage is
placed by insurance brokers acting on behalf of insureds.

Through a single
wholly-owned syndicate at Lloyd’s established in 1996 as Syndicate 1211 and
re-branded as Syndicate 5000 in November 2002, we underwrite insurance in four
principal lines of business:

aviation,
marine, global property

and

personal lines

.

Aviation

underwrites a broad spectrum of
international airline, manufacturer, airport and general aviation
business.

Marine

underwrites energy, cargo and hull coverages.

Global
property

underwrites property coverages worldwide.

Personal
lines

provides specialized accident and health coverages for
international clients, including personal accident, kidnap and ransom, and
payment protection insurance.  Prior to
2003, the aviation and personal lines businesses were underwritten through
other syndicates that we managed and in which we participated with other
members of Lloyd’s.  We do not provide
Syndicate 5000 with direct capital contributions but rather obtain bank letters
of credit to support the syndicate’s insurance exposure.  We are liable, however, if these letters of
credit are insufficient to cover the syndicate’s losses and must reimburse the
banks that issue the letters of credit for any amounts they paid on our behalf.

In addition to the
property-liability business we underwrite at Lloyd’s, we also manage, and have
made a commitment to provide 13% of the capacity of, Syndicate 779 at Lloyd’s,
which underwrites specialty term life insurance to individuals primarily in the
United Kingdom and other European countries.

Our ongoing international
specialties are located in the United Kingdom, Canada and the Republic of
Ireland, where we offer specialized insurance and risk management services to a
variety of industry sectors.  Our
ongoing international operations primarily underwrite employers’ liability
(similar to workers’ compensation coverage in the U.S.), public and product
liability (the equivalent of general liability), professional indemnity
(similar to directors and officers or errors and omissions coverage) and
property.  The

Global Underwriting

business center
underwrites “home-foreign” business, representing coverage for a U.S.
organization’s property-liability exposures in a foreign country, and
“reverse-flow” business, which involves coverage of a foreign organization’s
property or liability exposures located in the country of the insurer’s
domicile, as part of a global program.


Runoff
Business Segments

Health Care.

The

Health
Care

segment, which generated $173 million in net written premiums
in 2002 (accounting for 15% of our runoff segments’ premium volume and 3% of
our consolidated written premium volume), historically provided a wide range of
medical liability insurance products and services for health care providers
throughout the entire health care delivery system, including individual
physicians, physician groups, hospitals, managed care organizations and
long-term care facilities, as well as certain traditional medical care
coverages.  Products include coverages
for healthcare professionals (physicians and surgeons, dental professionals and
nurses); individual healthcare facilities (including hospitals, long-term care
facilities and other facilities such as laboratories); and entire systems, such
as hospital networks and managed care systems. 
Typically the

Health Care

segment underwrote coverages on the basis of an entire clinic, hospital or
other organization, so that we are exposed to losses from the malpractice of
any one practitioner on the staff of, or with privileges at, the
organization.  Policies written by this
segment are subject to high severity of claims.  In the fourth quarter of 2001, we announced our intention to exit
the medical liability insurance market, subject to applicable regulatory
requirements.  Accordingly, this segment
was considered to be in runoff in 2002. 
As part of the fourth-quarter 2002 revision of our segment reporting
structure, the international business previously included in this segment was
reclassified to the “Other” segment.

Reinsurance.

Our

Reinsurance

segment (formerly known as “St. Paul Re”) generated $751 million of net written
premiums in 2002 (accounting for 65% of our runoff segments’ premium volume and
11% of our consolidated written premium volume).  In the years prior to 2002, our

Reinsurance

segment generally underwrote treaty and facultative reinsurance for property,
liability, ocean marine, surety, certain specialty classes of coverage, and
“nontraditional” reinsurance, which provided limited traditional underwriting
risk protection combined with financial risk protection.

In late 2001, we
announced our intention to cease underwriting certain types of reinsurance
coverages and narrow our geographic presence in 2002.  In November 2002, we transferred our ongoing reinsurance
operations to Platinum Underwriters Holdings, Ltd. (“Platinum”) while retaining
liabilities generally for reinsurance contracts incepting prior to January 1,
2002, as well as all liabilities relating to the flooding in Europe in August
2002.  Note 2 to our consolidated
financial statements included on pages 67 and 68 of our 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders
contains more information about the transfer of business to Platinum and is
incorporated herein by reference.

Our remaining in-force
pre-2002 exposures are principally in the following areas:

•

North
American Casualty, which offered customers with exposures in the United States
and Canada the following types of casualty reinsurance coverages: general,
workers’ compensation, auto, medical professional, non-medical professional,
directors and officers, employment practices, surplus lines, umbrella and
environmental impairment as well as accident and health reinsurance coverages;

•

International,
which underwrote property and casualty reinsurance for customers domiciled
outside of North America and marine and aerospace reinsurance for customers
located throughout the world;

•

Finite
Risk, which underwrote non-traditional reinsurance treaties including
multi-year excess-of-loss treaties, aggregate stop loss treaties, finite quota
share treaties, loss portfolio transfers, and adverse loss development covers;
and

•

Certain
bond, credit and financial risk coverages.

Other

.

Our

Other

business segment, which accounted for $235 million of net written premiums in
2002 (accounting for 20% of our runoff segments’ premium volume and 3% of our
consolidated written premiums), was formed in the fourth quarter of 2002 upon
the revision of our segment reporting structure and is considered to be
entirely in runoff.  We have a
management team in place for these operations whose goal is to ensure that our
outstanding claim obligations are settled in an expeditious and economical
manner.  This segment includes the
results of the following international insurance operations.


•

Runoff operations at Lloyd’s

, primarily
consisting of the following lines of business written through seven syndicates,
in which our ownership ranged from 32% to 100% as of December 31, 2002, and
comprising both U.S. and non-U.S. coverages: casualty insurance and
reinsurance, non-marine reinsurance, professional liability insurance (particularly
for financial customers, and directors’ and officers’ liability insurance) and
our participation in the insuring of the Lloyd’s Central Fund.

•

Unionamerica

, the London-based
underwriting unit acquired as part of our purchase of MMI in 2000.  Unionamerica underwrote liability and
property coverages, including medical malpractice and other professional
liability and directors’ and officers’ liability, both inside and outside of
Lloyd’s, on both an insurance and excess-of-loss reinsurance basis; and

•

All
other international runoff lines of business we decided to exit at the end of
2001, consisting of health care business in the United Kingdom, Canada and
Ireland, as well as our underwriting operations in Germany, France, the
Netherlands, Argentina, Mexico (excluding surety business), Spain, Australia,
New Zealand, Botswana and South Africa. 
In December 2002, we sold our operations in Argentina, Mexico (excluding
our surety operations) and Spain.

Product
Information

The following table
summarizes our net written premiums by product line for each of the years ended
December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000.

Principal
Markets and Methods of Distribution

Our insurance operations
in the United States are licensed to transact business in all 50 states, the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands.  At least five percent of our 2002 U.S.
property-liability direct written premiums were produced in each of California,
New York, Texas, Florida and Illinois.

Our primary insurance business in the United States is
produced primarily through over 4,000 independent insurance agencies and
insurance brokers.  The needs of agents,
brokers and policyholders are addressed through approximately 100 offices
located throughout the United States. 
Discover Re, a component of our Specialty Commercial segment,
underwrites alternative risk transfer business from its Farmington, CT
headquarters and from regional offices in Atlanta, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco.


Our international
operations are headquartered in London and underwrite insurance primarily
through domestic operations in the United Kingdom, Canada and the Republic of
Ireland.  We also underwrite surety
business in Mexico.

Through our involvement
at Lloyd’s, we have access to insurance markets in virtually every country in
the world.  At our ongoing operations at
Lloyd’s, we underwrite property-liability business through a single, wholly
owned syndicate (Syndicate 5000) and specialty life insurance through our 13%
participation in Syndicate 779.  Our
managing agency, operating under the name St. Paul Syndicate Management Ltd.,
underwrites business for these syndicates, which represent approximately 3% of
Lloyd’s total capacity.

Reserves for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

General Information.

When claims are made by or against
policyholders, any amounts that our underwriting operations pay or expect to
pay to the claimant are referred to as losses. 
The costs of investigating, resolving and processing these claims are
referred to as loss adjustment expenses (“LAE”).  Our loss reserves reflect estimates of total losses and LAE we
will ultimately have to pay under insurance policies, surety bonds and
reinsurance agreements.  The reserves
for unpaid losses and LAE at December 31, 2002 cover claims that were incurred
not only in 2002 but also in prior years. 
They include estimates of the total cost of claims that have already
been reported but not yet settled (“case” reserves), and those that have been
incurred but not yet reported (“IBNR” reserves).  Loss reserves are reduced for estimates of salvage and
subrogation.

Loss reserves for tabular
workers’ compensation business and certain assumed reinsurance contracts are
discounted to present value.  Additional
information about these discounted liabilities is set forth in Note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements included on pages 63 through 67 of our 2002
Annual Report to Shareholders, and is incorporated herein by reference.  During 2002, $14 million of discount was
amortized and $3 million of additional discount was accrued.

Because many of the
coverages we offer involve claims that may not ultimately be settled for many
years after they are incurred, subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure
to losses are an integral and necessary component of our loss reserving
process.  We record our reserves by
considering a range of estimates bounded by a high and low point.  Within that range, we record our best
estimate.  We continually review our
reserves, using a variety of statistical and actuarial techniques to analyze
current claim costs, frequency and severity data, and prevailing economic,
social and legal factors.  We adjust
reserves established in prior years as loss experience develops and new
information becomes available. 
Adjustments to previously estimated reserves are reflected in results in
the year in which they are made.

While
we believe our reported reserves make a reasonable provision for all of our
unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense obligations, it should be noted that
the process of estimating required reserves does, by its very nature, involve
uncertainty.  The level of uncertainty
can be influenced by such factors as the existence of long-tail coverages
(which we consider to be business in which the majority of coverages involve
average loss payment lags of three years or more beyond the expiration of the
policy), and changes in claim handling practices.  Many of our insurance subsidiaries have underwritten long-tail
coverages, and the primary lines of business fitting that criterion are general
liability, workers’ compensation and casualty excess reinsurance.  In addition, claim handling practices change
and evolve over the years.  For example,
new initiatives are commenced, claim offices are reorganized and relocated,
claim handling responsibilities of individual adjusters are changed, use of a
call center is increased, use of technology is increased, caseload issues and
case reserving practices are monitored more frequently, etc.  Furthermore, establishing reserves for our
reinsurance and retrocessional business is influenced by our need to rely on
the ceding insurers and reinsurers for information regarding reported claims.  However, all of the above factors are
sources of uncertainty that we have recognized in establishing our reserves.

The “Loss and Loss
Adjustment Expense Reserves” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis
included in our 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders includes more information
about our loss reserves, including an analysis of our long-tail exposures, and
is incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K at Item 7.


Ten-year Development.

The table on page 18 presents a development
of net loss and LAE reserve liabilities and payments for the years 1992 through
2002.  The top line on the table shows
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE, net of reinsurance
recoverables, recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the years
indicated.

The table excludes the
reserves and activity of Economy Fire and Casualty Company and its subsidiaries
(“Economy”), which were included in the sale of our standard personal insurance
operations to Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company
(“Metropolitan”) in 1999.  The table
does, however, include reserves and activity for the non-Economy standard
personal insurance business that was sold to Metropolitan, since we remain
liable for claims on non-Economy standard personal insurance policies that
result from losses occurring prior to Sept. 30, 1999 (the closing date of the
sale).  Note 16 to our consolidated
financial statements, which includes additional information regarding the sale
of Economy and the related reserves, is included on pages 81 and 82 of our 2002
Annual Report to Shareholders and is incorporated herein by reference.

When we acquire an
insurance underwriting company, we include loss development for the acquired
company in the following table beginning with the date of acquisition; however,
that development includes activity from periods prior to our acquisition.

In 1997, we changed the
method by which we assign loss activity to a particular year for assumed
reinsurance written by our U.K.-based reinsurance operation, which, as noted
above, is now in runoff.  Prior to 1997,
that loss activity was assigned to the year in which the underlying reinsurance
contract was written.  In 1997, our
analysis indicated that an excess amount of loss activity was being assigned to
prior years because of this practice. 
As a result, we implemented an improved procedure in 1997 that more
accurately assigns loss activity for this business to the year in which it
occurred.  This change had the impact of
increasing favorable development on previously established reserves by
approximately $110 million in 1997. 
There was no net impact on total incurred losses, however, because there
was a corresponding increase in the provision for current year loss activity in
1997.  Development data for individual
years prior to 1997 in this table were not restated to reflect this new
procedure because reliable data to do so was not available.

The upper portion of the
table, which shows the re-estimated amounts relating to the previously recorded
liabilities, is based upon experience as of the end of each succeeding
year.  These estimates are either
increased or decreased as further information becomes known about individual
claims and as changes in the trend of claim frequency and severity become
apparent.

The “Cumulative
redundancy (deficiency)” line on the table for any given year represents the
aggregate change in the estimates for all years subsequent to the year the
reserves were initially established. 
For example, the 1993 net reserve of $12,970 million developed to
$12,227 million, or a $743 million redundancy, by the end of 1995.  By the end of 2002, the 1993 reserve had
developed a redundancy of $1,883 million. 
The changes in the estimate of 1993 loss reserves were reflected in
operations during the past nine years. 
Likewise, the deficiency that developed with respect to year-end 2000
reserves (primarily related to our medical liability business) was reflected in
our results of operations for 2002 and 2001.

In 1993, we adopted the
provisions of SFAS No. 113, “Accounting and Reporting for Reinsurance of
Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts.” 
This statement required, among other things, that reinsurance recoverables
on unpaid losses and LAE be shown as an asset, instead of the prior practice of
netting this amount against insurance reserves for balance sheet reporting
purposes.

The middle portion of the
table represents a reconciliation between the net reserve liability as shown on
the top line of the table and the gross reserve liability as shown on our
balance sheet.  This portion of the
table also presents the gross re-estimated reserve liability as of the end of
the latest re-estimation period (December 31, 2002) and the related
re-estimated reinsurance recoverable.

The lower portion of the
table presents the cumulative amounts paid with respect to the previously
recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year.  For example, as of December 31, 2002, $8,976
million of the currently estimated $11,087 million of net losses and LAE that
have been incurred for the years up to and including 1993 have been paid.  Thus, as of December 31, 2002, it is
estimated that $2,111 million of net incurred losses and LAE have yet to be
paid for the years up to and including 1993.


Caution should be
exercised in evaluating the information shown in this table.  It should be noted that each amount includes
the effects of all changes in amounts for prior periods.  For example, the portion of the development
shown for year-end 1998 reserves that relates to 1993 losses is included in the
cumulative redundancy (deficiency) for the years 1993 through 1998.

In addition, the table
presents calendar year data.  It does
not present accident or policy year development data, which some readers may be
more accustomed to analyzing.  The
social, economic and legal conditions and other trends which have had an impact
on the changes in the estimated liability in the past are not necessarily
indicative of the future.  Accordingly,
readers are cautioned against extrapolating any conclusions about future
results from the information presented in this table.

Note 11 to our
consolidated financial statements included on pages 74 and 75 of our 2002
Annual Report to Shareholders contains a reconciliation of beginning and ending
loss reserve liabilities for each of the years 2002, 2001 and 2000, and is
incorporated herein by reference. 
Additional information about our reserves is contained in the “Loss and
Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves” and “Environmental and Asbestos Claims”
sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 46 through 49 of said
Annual Report, and in the “Health Care” section of Management’s Discussion and
Analysis on pages 40 through 43 of said Annual Report, which are also
incorporated herein by reference.


Analysis of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense (LAE)
Development

(In millions)


The table shows that a
cumulative deficiency of $1,505 million had developed on year-end 2000 net
reserves by the end of 2002.  The
primary contributors to this adverse development were the $735 million of
prior-year loss provisions recorded in 2001 related to medical malpractice
coverages in our Health Care segment, $217 million of adverse prior-year loss
development in our Surety & Construction segment recorded in 2002, and the
$472 million provision recorded in our Commercial Lines segment in 2002 related
to the Western MacArthur asbestos litigation settlement.

Reinsurance

When we purchase
reinsurance or “cede” insurance premiums and risks, other insurers or
reinsurers agree to share certain risks that we have underwritten.  The primary purpose of reinsurance is to
limit a ceding insurer’s maximum net loss from individually large or aggregate
risks as well as to provide protection against catastrophes.  Our reinsurance program is generally managed
from a corporate risk-tolerance perspective. 
Reinsurance contracts addressing specific business center risks are
utilized on a limited basis to cover unique exposures as necessary.  Our reinsurance program addresses risk
through a combination of per-risk reinsurance and reinsurance contracts
protecting against the aggregation of risk exposures.  Facultative reinsurance, which covers specific risks, is also
used to supplement our reinsurance program.

In the wake of the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, price increases and pressures on contract
terms and conditions continue in the reinsurance market.  Despite these constraints, our reinsurance
program continues to support our primary underwriting reinsurance needs,
particularly as increases in rates and reductions in limits also continue in
the reinsurance market.

After the terrorist
attack, reinsurers, in general, specifically excluded terrorism coverage from
property reinsurance treaties that subsequently renewed.  As a result, in the second quarter of 2002,
we purchased limited specific terrorism coverage in the form of two separate
property reinsurance treaties – a per-risk terrorism treaty and a catastrophe
terrorism treaty.  The per-risk treaty
provides coverage on a per-building, per-event basis for a loss of up to $110
million, after a first layer of $15 million of losses retained by us.  The catastrophe terrorism treaty provides
coverage of up to $200 million in excess of the first $100 million of losses
resulting from catastrophic losses caused by terrorism.  Both treaties have one additional set of
limits for subsequent terrorism events and expire in April 2003.  In addition, we have renewed the majority of
our reinsurance treaties covering workers’ compensation and general liability
business.  Thus far, those renewals
included coverage for terrorism.  Our
reinsurance treaties do not cover acts of terrorism involving nuclear,
biological or chemical events.

We have not determined
whether we will seek to renew our terrorism property reinsurance treaties upon
their expiration in April 2003, and, in any event, there can be no assurance
that we would be able to secure such terrorism reinsurance coverage with
acceptable terms, or at all, at that time.

Approximately 98% of our
domestic reinsurance recoverable balances at December 31, 2002 were with
reinsurance companies having financial strength ratings of A- or higher by A.M
Best or Standard & Poor’s, were from state sponsored facilities or
reinsurance pools, or were collateralized reinsurance programs associated with
certain of our insurance operations.  We
have an internal credit security committee, which uses a comprehensive credit
risk review process in selecting our reinsurers.  This process considers such factors as ratings by major ratings
agencies, financial condition, parental support, operating practices, and
market news and developments.  The
credit security committee convenes quarterly to evaluate these factors and take
action on our approved list of reinsurers, as necessary.

We maintain an allowance
for uncollectible reinsurance, which is evaluated and adjusted on a regular
basis to reflect disputed coverages and changing market and credit
conditions.  Our allowance for
uncollectible reinsurance as a percentage of total reinsurance recoverable
balances was 1.5% and 1.6% as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively.  Historically, our write-offs of
uncollectible reinsurance balances have averaged less than $3 million per year.

In 2000 and 2001, we
entered into two aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties.  One of these treaties in each year was
corporate-wide, with coverage triggered when our insurance losses and LAE
across all lines of business reached a certain level, as prescribed by terms of
the treaty (the “corporate program”). 
We were not party to such a treaty in 2002.  Additionally, our Reinsurance segment was impacted by cessions
made under a separate treaty in those years and 2002 unrelated to the corporate
treaty. The combined impact of these treaties (together, the “reinsurance
treaties”) is included in the table that follows.


The $35 million of
negative losses and loss adjustment expenses ceded in 2002 was related to the
reinsurance segment treaty and primarily resulted from a commutation of a
portion of that treaty.  Note 19 to our
consolidated financial statements on pages 85 and 86 of our 2002 Annual Report
to Shareholders, which provides a schedule of ceded reinsurance and additional
information about the reinsurance treaties, is incorporated herein by
reference.

Until the transfer of our
ongoing reinsurance operations to Platinum in November 2002, we underwrote
assumed reinsurance coverages on a worldwide basis.  We remain liable on all reinsurance contracts with inception
dates prior to January 1, 2002, as well as on certain 2002 contracts that were
not transferred to Platinum.

Property - Liability Investment
Operations

Our board of directors
approves the overall investment plan for the companies within The St. Paul’s
property-liability operations.  Each
subsidiary develops its own specific investment policy tailored to comply with
domestic laws and regulations and the overall corporate investment plan.  The primary objectives of those plans are to
ensure our ability to meet our liabilities, primarily consisting of insurance
claim payments, and, having done that, to increase our shareholders’ equity.

The majority of funds
available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of
predominantly investment-grade fixed income securities, consisting primarily of
government-issued securities and corporate bonds.  We also invest much smaller amounts in equity securities, venture
capital and real estate.  The latter
three investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also involve
varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less
liquidity.

The following discussion provides more information on
each of our invested asset classes.

Fixed Income Securities.

Our portfolio of fixed income securities
constituted 75% (at cost) of our property-liability insurance operations’
investment portfolio at December 31, 2002. 
The portfolio is primarily composed of high-quality, intermediate-term
taxable U.S. government, foreign government, corporate and mortgage-backed
bonds, and tax-exempt U.S. municipal bonds. 
The table on the following page presents information about the fixed maturity
portfolio for the years 2000 through 2002 (dollars in millions).

We participate in a
securities lending program whereby certain securities from our fixed income
portfolio are loaned to other institutions. 
Our policy is to require collateral equal to 102 percent of the fair
value of the loaned securities.  We
maintain full ownership rights to the securities loaned, and continue to earn
interest on them.  In addition, we have
the ability to sell the securities while they are on loan.  We have an indemnification agreement with
the lending agents in the event a borrower becomes insolvent or fails to return
securities.  We record securities
lending collateral as a liability and pay the borrower an agreed upon interest
rate.  The proceeds from the collateral
are invested in short-term investments and are reported on the balance
sheet.  We share a portion of the
interest earned on these short-term investments with the lending agent.  The fair value of the securities on loan is
removed from fixed income securities on the balance sheet and shown as a
separate investment asset.


Our decision whether to
purchase taxable or tax-exempt securities is driven by corporate tax
considerations, and the relationship between taxable and tax-exempt yields at
the time of purchase.  In recent years,
the availability of corporate Net Operating Loss carryforwards and Alternative
Minimum Tax carryforwards has increased our ability to benefit from taxable
investment income.  Accordingly, a
significant majority of our new fixed income purchases in recent years have
consisted of taxable bonds.  We carry
our fixed maturities on our balance sheet at their estimated fair value, with
unrealized appreciation and depreciation (net of taxes) recorded in common
shareholders’ equity.

We manage our bond
portfolio conservatively to provide reasonable returns while limiting exposure
to risks.  At December 31, 2002,
approximately 97% of our fixed income portfolio, comprised of our fixed income
securities as well as the securities on loan and short-term investments, was
rated investment grade.  The remaining
3% of this fixed income portfolio primarily consisted of high-yield bonds, and
also included non-rated securities, most of which we believe would be
considered investment-grade, if rated.

Real Estate and Mortgage Loans

.  Our real estate holdings consist of a
diversified portfolio of commercial office and warehouse properties that we own
directly or have partial interest in through joint ventures.  The properties are geographically
distributed throughout the United States and had an overall occupancy rate of
90% at December 31, 2002.  We also have
a portfolio of real estate mortgage investments acquired in our merger with
USF&G Corporation in 1998.  The real
estate and mortgage loan portfolio produced $77 million of pretax investment
income in 2002 and generated $2 million of pretax realized gains.

Venture Capital

.  Securities of small- to medium-sized companies spanning a variety
of industries comprise our venture capital holdings, which accounted for 3% of
property-liability investments (at cost) at December 31, 2002.  Venture capital investments generated pretax
realized investment losses of $200 million in 2002, driven by impairment write-downs
in the carrying value of certain of our investments and the sale of the
majority of our partnership investment holdings.  The carrying $581 million value of venture capital investments at
December 31, 2002 included $4 million of pretax unrealized appreciation.

Equities

. 
Our equity holdings consist of a diversified portfolio of public common
stock, comprising 2% of total property-liability investments (at cost) at
year-end 2002.  In May and June 2002, we
reduced our equity investments by $445 million, or 46% of the total outstanding
at the time (at cost), at a market level higher than that which prevailed for
the remainder of 2002.  Our decision to
reduce our public equity holdings was prompted by several factors, including
our opinion as to the near-term direction of equity prices, a comprehensive
evaluation of our aggregate equity exposure (including venture capital and
equities held by our pension fund), and our opinion as to the level of public
equity investments that is appropriate for publicly held insurance companies.  By the end of 2002, we had reduced our
equity investments by $683 million (at cost) since year-end 2001.

Short-Term and Other Investments.

Our portfolio also includes short-term
securities and other miscellaneous investments (including our 14% equity
ownership stake in Platinum and our warrants to purchase up to six million
additional common shares of Platinum), which in the aggregate comprised 13% of
property-liability investments at December 31, 2002.  Also included in “Other investments” at December 31, 2002 was an
approximately $400 million long-term interest-bearing security from a highly
rated entity, supporting a series of insurance transactions.

Derivatives.

Our property-liability investment operations have had limited
involvement with derivative financial instruments, primarily for purposes of
hedging against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest
rates.  Effective January. 1, 2001, we
adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Standards (SFAS) No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended,
which required the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets
or liabilities on the balance sheet. 
Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements on page 73 of our 2002
Annual Report to Shareholders, which provides more information regarding the
impact of adopting SFAS No. 133, is incorporated herein by reference.

In addition to Note 10,
Notes 1, 8 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included
in our 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders, also provide additional information
about our investment portfolio and are incorporated herein by reference.  The “Property-Liability Investment
Operations” on pages 44 through 46 and “Exposures to Market Risk” sections of
Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 54 and 55 of our 2002 Annual
Report to Shareholders are also incorporated herein by reference.


Asset Management

Nuveen Investments, Inc.
(“Nuveen Investments,” formerly The John Nuveen Company) is our asset
management subsidiary.  The St. Paul and
its largest property-liability insurance subsidiary, Fire and Marine) hold a
combined 79% interest in Nuveen Investments.

Nuveen Investments’ core
businesses are asset management and related research, as well as the
development, marketing and distribution of investment products and services for
the affluent, high net worth and institutional market segments.  Nuveen Investments distributes its
investment products and services, including individually managed accounts,
closed-end exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, to the affluent and high net
worth market segments through unaffiliated intermediary firms including
broker/dealers, commercial banks, affiliates of insurance providers, financial
planners, accountants, consultants and investment advisors.  Nuveen Investments also provides managed
account services to several institutional market segments and channels.

Nuveen Investments’
primary business activities generate three principal sources of revenue: (1)
advisory fees earned on assets under management, including exchange-traded
funds, separately managed accounts and mutual funds; (2) underwriting and
distribution revenues earned upon the sale of certain investment products and (3)
performance fees earned on certain institutional accounts based on the
performance of such accounts.  Advisory
fees accounted for 90% of Nuveen Investments’ total revenues in 2002.

Nuveen Investments’
operations are carried on by eleven subsidiaries, including Nuveen Investments
LLC (formerly Nuveen Investments), a registered broker and dealer in securities
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and eight investment advisory
subsidiaries registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.  The eight investment advisory subsidiaries
are Nuveen Advisory Corp. (“NAC”), Nuveen Institutional Advisory Corp.
(“NIAC”), Nuveen Asset Management Inc. (“NAM”), Rittenhouse Asset Management,
Inc. (“Rittenhouse”), Nuveen Senior Loan Asset Management, Inc. (“NSLAM”),
Symphony Asset Management LLC (“Symphony”), NWQ Investment Management Company,
Inc. (“NWQ”) and Nuveen Investment Advisors, Inc.  Nuveen Investments LLC provides investment product distribution
and related services for Nuveen’s managed funds and defined portfolios.  NAC, NIAC and NSLAM provide investment
management services for and administer the business affairs of the Nuveen
managed funds.  Rittenhouse, NWQ,
Symphony and NAM provide investment management services for individual and
institutional managed accounts. Rittenhouse, Symphony and NWQ also act as
sub-adviser and portfolio manager for mutual funds managed by NIAC.  The other two subsidiaries are not
registered broker-dealers or investment advisors and do not provide product
distribution or investment management services for the company.

At December 31, 2002,
Nuveen Investments’ assets under management totaled $79.7 billion, consisting
of $39.9 billion of exchange-traded funds, $19.4 billion of retail managed
accounts, $8.5 billion of institutional managed accounts, and $11.9 billion of
mutual funds.

Competition

Property-Liability Insurance

The property-liability
insurance industry is highly competitive in the areas of price, service,
product offerings, technology and agent relationships.  Ratings issued by independent ratings
agencies are also a competitive factor in the insurance business.  Increasing the competitive pressure is the
current low interest rate environment that is impacting investment returns and
making underwriting decisions even more critical.  Our domestic and international insurance subsidiaries compete
with other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups
and other underwriting organizations. 
Competitors in this market are primarily national property-liability
insurance companies willing to write most classes of business using traditional
products and pricing and, to a lesser extent, regional insurance companies and
companies that have developed niche programs for specific industry segments.  In addition, many large commercial customers
self-insure their risks or utilize large deductibles on purchased
insurance.  There are approximately
3,400 property and liability insurance companies in the United States operating
independently or in groups, and no single company or group is dominant.  According to A.M. Best, we are the
fourth-largest United States


commercial lines property
and liability insurance group based on 2001 direct premiums written.  Some of our competitors are larger and have
greater access to capital.  In various
markets, we also compete based on ratings and several of our competitors are
higher rated.

In addition, the
financial services industry in general continues to be affected by an
intensifying competitive environment, as demonstrated by consolidation through
mergers and acquisitions and competition from new entrants, as well as
established competitors using new technologies, including the Internet, to
establish or expand their businesses. 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, passed in 1999, which repealed U.S. laws
that separated commercial banking, investment banking and insurance activities,
together with changes to the industry resulting from previous reforms, has
increased the number of companies competing for a similar customer base.

Our competitors in the
Specialty Commercial and Commercial Lines segments include American
International Group, The Chubb Corporation, CNA Financial Corporation, Hartford
Insurance Group, SAFECO Corporation and Travelers Property Casualty Corp.

Our competitors in the
Surety & Construction segment include CNA Surety Corporation, American
International Group, Travelers Property Casualty Corp., and Zurich North
America.  In our International and
Lloyd’s segment, our international specialties compete with numerous insurers
in the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland while competitors in Lloyd’s markets
in which we are active include various insurance companies and other members of
Lloyd’s.

Our subsidiaries compete
principally by attempting to offer a combination of superior products,
underwriting expertise and services at a competitive, yet profitable,
price.  Additionally, our relatively
large size and underwriting capacity provide us with opportunities not available
to smaller companies.

Asset Management

Nuveen Investments is
subject to substantial competition in all aspects of its business.  The registered representatives that
distribute Nuveen Investments’ investment products also distribute numerous
competing products, often including products sponsored by the retail
distribution firms where they are employed. 
There are relatively few barriers to entry for new investment management
firms.  Nuveen Investments’ managed
account business is also subject to substantial competition from other
investment management firms seeking to be approved as managers in the various
“wrap-fee” programs.  The sponsor firms
have a limited number of approved managers at the highest and most attractive
levels of their programs and closely monitor the investment performance of such
firms on an on-going basis as they evaluate which firms are eligible for
continued participation in these programs. 
Nuveen Investments is also subject to competition in obtaining the
commitment of underwriters to underwrite its exchange traded fund
offerings.  To the extent the increased
competition for underwriting and distribution causes high distribution costs,
Nuveen Investments’ net revenue and earnings will be reduced.  Investment products are sold to the public
by broker/dealers, banks, insurance companies and others, and many competing
investment product sponsors offer a broader array of investment products.

Many of these
institutions have substantially greater resources than Nuveen.  In addition, continuing consolidation in the
financial services industry and the prolonged slump in equity market
performance are altering the landscape in which Nuveen Investments’
distributors compete and the economics of many of the products they offer.  The effect that these continuing changes in
the brokerage and investment management industries will have on Nuveen
Investments and its competitors cannot be predicted.  Nuveen Investments competes with other providers of products
primarily on the basis of the range of products offered, the investment
performance of such products, quality of service, fees charged, the level and
type of broker compensation, the manner in which such products are marketed and
distributed, and the services provided to registered representatives and
investors.


Regulation

Property-Liability Insurance

Insurance
Holding Company Regulation

.

The St. Paul
and our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation as an
insurance holding company system in states where our insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled, which currently include Minnesota, Maryland, Wisconsin, North
Dakota, Mississippi, Iowa, Illinois, California, Delaware, Indiana, Vermont and
New York.  Such regulation generally
provides that transactions between companies within the holding company system
must be fair and equitable.  Transfers
of assets among such affiliated companies, certain dividend payments from
insurance subsidiaries and certain material transactions between companies
within the system may be subject to prior notice to, or prior approval by,
state regulatory authorities.  Such
regulations also require the insurance holding company and each insurance
subsidiary to register with the insurance department in the insurance
subsidiary’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other
information about the operations of companies within the holding company
system.

Payment
of Dividends.

Fire
and Marine is our lead U.S. property-liability underwriting subsidiary, and its
dividend paying capacity is regulated by the laws of Minnesota, its state of
domicile.  Minnesota insurance law
provides that, except in the case of extraordinary dividends or distributions,
all dividends or distributions paid by Fire and Marine may be declared or paid
only from earned surplus, or unassigned funds, as determined pursuant to
statutory accounting principles.  As of
December 31, 2002, Fire and Marine’s earned surplus was $2.0 billion.  Fire and Marine also must notify the Minnesota
insurance regulator of its intent to pay a dividend if the dividend, together
with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months,
would exceed a specified statutory limit, and may not pay such dividend until
either 30 days after the Minnesota insurance regulator has received notice of
it and has not within that period disapproved it, or the regulator has approved
the payment.  The current statutory
limitation applicable to Minnesota property-liability insurers generally is the
greater of:

(1)

10%
of such insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the December 31 next
preceding the date of the proposed dividend or distribution; or

(2)

the
net income of such insurer, not including realized investment gains, for the 12-month
period ending the December 31 next preceding the date of the proposed dividend
or distribution,

in each case determined
under statutory accounting principles. 
Statutory accounting principles differ from GAAP primarily in relation
to deferred policy acquisition costs, deferred taxes and certain other assets,
and reserve calculation assumptions. The Minnesota insurance regulator is also
required to review at least annually the dividends paid by a Minnesota domestic
insurer to determine if the dividends are reasonable based upon (1) the
adequacy of surplus as regards policyholders remaining after the dividend
payments and (2) the quality of the insurer’s earnings and extent to which the
required earnings include extraordinary items.

Other states and foreign
jurisdictions have similar regulations to those of Minnesota that affect the
ability of our other insurance subsidiaries, most of which are subsidiaries of
Fire and Marine, to pay dividends.  The
laws regulating dividends of the other states and foreign jurisdictions where
our other insurance subsidiaries are domiciled are similar, but not identical,
to Minnesota’s, and may be more restrictive. 
In addition, many of our insurance subsidiaries are held by other
insurance subsidiaries, and only indirectly by us.  Therefore, the ability of these indirectly-held subsidiaries to
pay dividends to their direct parents, and our ability to receive these
dividends from those intermediate subsidiaries, will be subject to the
respective ability of all such subsidiaries to meet financial and regulatory
requirements applicable to them.

During 2002, we received
no cash dividends from our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. Although $505 million
will be available for dividends in 2003 without prior regulatory approval, business
and regulatory considerations may impact the amount of dividends actually paid.


Change
of Control.

Most
states, including the states in which our domestic insurance subsidiaries are
domiciled, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a change of
control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company.  Laws such as these that apply to us prevent
any person from acquiring control of The St. Paul or of our insurance
subsidiaries unless that person has filed a statement with specified
information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior
approval.  Under most states’ statutes,
acquiring 10% or more of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent
company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such
presumption may be rebutted. 
Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of the voting
securities of The St. Paul without the prior approval of the insurance
regulators of the states in which our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled will
be in violation of these states’ laws and may be subject to injunctive action
requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the relevant
insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other
actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator.

In addition, many state
insurance laws require prior notification of state insurance departments of a
change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that
state.  While these pre-notification
statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove the
change in control, they authorize regulatory action in the affected state if
particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration.  Any future transactions that would
constitute a change in control of The St. Paul may require prior notification
in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification laws.

Change of control laws
may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent
a change of control of The St. Paul, including through transactions, and in
particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our shareholders might
consider to be desirable.

State
Regulation of Insurance Operations.

Our insurance
subsidiaries are subject to licensing and supervision by government regulatory
agencies in the jurisdictions in which they do business.  The nature and extent of such regulation
vary but generally have their source in statutes that delegate regulatory,
supervisory and administrative powers to insurance regulators, which in the
U.S. are state authorities.  Such
regulation, supervision and administration of the insurance subsidiaries may
relate, among other things, to the standards of solvency which must be met and
maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and
limitations on investments; restrictions on the size of risk which may be
insured under a single policy; deposits of securities for the benefit of
policyholders; regulation of policy forms and premium rates; periodic
examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports
required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other
purposes; requirements regarding reserves for unearned premiums, losses and
other matters; the nature of and limitations on dividends to policyholders and
shareholders; the nature and extent of required participation in insurance
guaranty funds; and the involuntary assumption of hard-to-place or high-risk insurance
business, primarily in workers’ compensation insurance lines.

Loss ratio trends in
property-liability insurance underwriting experience may be improved by, among
other things, changing the kinds of coverages provided by policies, providing
loss prevention and risk management services, increasing premium rates,
purchasing reinsurance or by a combination of these factors. The ability of our
insurance subsidiaries to meet emerging adverse underwriting trends may be
delayed, from time to time, by the effects of laws which require prior approval
by insurance regulatory authorities of changes in policy forms and premium
rates. Our U.S. underwriting operations do business in all 50 states and the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. A number
of these jurisdictions require prior approval of most or all premium rates.

Risk-Based
Capital Requirements.

In
order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association
of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) has adopted a formula and model law to
implement risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for most property and
casualty insurance companies, which is designed to determine minimum capital
requirements and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides
for policyholder obligations.  The RBC
formula for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major
areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: underwriting, which
encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing;
declines in asset values arising from market and/or credit risk; and
off-balance sheet risk arising from adverse experience from non-controlled
assets, guarantees for affiliates or other contingent liabilities and excessive
premium growth.


Under laws adopted by
individual states, insurers having less total adjusted capital than that
required by the RBC calculation will be subject to varying degrees of
regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy.  The RBC ratios for each of our insurance
subsidiaries currently are above the ranges that would require any regulatory
or corrective action.

IRIS Tests

. 
The NAIC has developed a set of financial relationships or tests known
as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state regulators in
monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying
companies that require special attention or action by insurance regulatory
authorities.  Insurance companies generally
submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using
prescribed financial data ratios, each with defined “usual ranges.”  Generally, regulators will begin to
investigate or monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the
usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. 
If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to
reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. 
We are not aware that any of our insurance companies are currently
subject to regulatory scrutiny based on these ratios.

Insurance Reserves

. State and provincial insurance
laws require us to analyze the adequacy of our reserves annually. Our actuaries
must submit an opinion that our reserves, when considered in light of the
assets we hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for our
contractual obligations and related expenses.

Shared Market and Similar Arrangements.

State insurance laws and
regulations require us to participate in mandatory property-liability “shared
market,” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide insurance coverage to
individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily
provided by private insurers.  Shared
market mechanisms include assigned risk plans; fair access to insurance
requirement or “FAIR” plans; and reinsurance facilities for covering
catastrophic risk.  In addition, some
states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that
exceed specified amounts.  Our
participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally
is related to the amounts of our direct writings for the type of coverage
written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state.  We cannot predict the financial impact of
our participation in these arrangements.

Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments

. 
Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which life and
property and casualty insurers doing business in the state may be assessed by
state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent
insurance companies to policyholders and claimants.  Typically, states assess each member insurer in an amount related
to the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business written by all
member insurers in the state.  For the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, we incurred net expense of $13 million
and $5 million, respectively, pursuant to state insurance guaranty association
laws.  While we cannot predict the
amount and timing of any future assessments on our insurance companies under
these laws, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for
assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to
insolvency proceedings.

Federal
Regulation of Insurance Operations.

On
November 26, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Terrorism Risk Insurance
Act of 2002, or “TRIA.”  A discussion of
TRIA’s principal provisions can be found in the “Terrorism Risk and
Legislation” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis included on pages
25 and 26 of our 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated
herein by reference.

Our domestic insurance
subsidiaries are subject to TRIA, although TRIA does not apply to all of the
coverages they write.  TRIA does apply
to most of our coverages written, including property, commercial multi-peril,
fire, ocean marine, inland marine, liability, commercial auto, aircraft, surety
and workers’ compensation.

International
Regulation of Insurance Operations.

Our insurance underwriting operations in the
United Kingdom are regulated by the Financial Services Authority (FSA).  The FSA’s principal objectives are to
maintain market confidence, promote public understanding of the financial
system, protect consumers, and to fight financial crime.  In Canada, the conduct of insurance business
is regulated under provisions of the Insurance Companies Act of 1992, which
requires insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on
the type and amount of insurance policies in force.  The Lloyd’s operation is also regulated by the FSA, which has
delegated certain regulatory responsibilities to the Council of Lloyd’s.  We are also subject to regulations in the
other countries and jurisdictions in which we underwrite insurance
business.  The terms and conditions of
our plans to cease underwriting operations in selected foreign countries were
subject to regulatory approval in several of those countries.


Asset Management

One of Nuveen
Investments’ subsidiaries is registered as a broker/dealer under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and is subject to regulation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the “Commission”), NASD Regulation, Inc. and other federal
and state agencies and self-regulatory organizations.  The securities industry is one of the most highly regulated in
the United States, and failure to comply with related laws and regulations can
result in the revocation of broker/dealer licenses, the imposition of censures
or fines, and the suspension or expulsion of a firm and/or its employees from
the securities business.

Each of Nuveen
Investments’ investment adviser subsidiaries is registered with the Commission
under the Investment Advisers Act. 
Virtually all aspects of Nuveen Investments’ investment management
business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations.  These laws and regulations are primarily
intended to benefit the investment product holder and generally grant supervisory
agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit
or restrict Nuveen from carrying on its investment management business in the
event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations.  In such event, the possible sanctions that
may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on
Nuveen Investments’ engaging in the investment management business for
specified periods of time, the revocation of its advisory subsidiaries’
registrations as investment advisers or other censures and fines.

Item 2.

Properties

.

Fire and Marine owns our corporate headquarters
buildings, located at 385 Washington Street and 130 West Sixth Street, St.
Paul, MN.  These buildings are adjacent
to one another and consist of approximately 1.1 million square feet of gross
floor space.  Fire and Marine also owns
property in Woodbury, MN where its Administrative Services Building and
off-site computer processing operations are located.  Fire and Marine also owns the former USF&G headquarters
campus known as Mount Washington Center, located in Baltimore, MD.  The campus currently houses offices for
certain executives of The St. Paul, as well as offices for certain
underwriting, legal and claim personnel. 
A training and development center also resides on the Mount Washington
campus.  Fire and Marine has leased a
substantial portion of one of the buildings on the campus to an outside
party.  At the end of January 2003, we
signed a nonbinding letter of intent to sell the entire Mount Washington Center
campus.  In the event that potential
sale occurs, we expect to lease back a portion of the property until September
30, 2004.

We own a building in
London, England, which houses a portion of our U.K. operations.  We retained ownership of another building in
London subsequent to the sale of Minet Holdings plc to Aon Corporation in 1997,
which is being leased to an outside party. 
In a transaction completed in March 2001, we sold a 50% interest in this
building.

Fire and Marine and its
subsidiary, St. Paul Properties, Inc., own a portfolio of income-producing
properties in various locations across the United States that they have
purchased for investment.  Included in
this portfolio are four office buildings in which we hold a 50% ownership
interest located on Manhattan Island in New York, NY which collectively
accounted for approximately 7% of the carrying value of the property portfolio
at December 31, 2002.

Our operating
subsidiaries rent or lease office space in most cities in which they operate.

Management considers the
currently owned and leased office facilities of The St. Paul and its
subsidiaries adequate for the current and anticipated future level of
operations.

Item 3.

Legal Proceedings.

The information set forth
in the “Legal Matters” section of Note 17 to our consolidated financial
statements, and the “Asbestos Settlement Agreement” and “Environmental and
Asbestos Claims” sections of Management’s Discussion and Analysis, which are
all included in our 2002 Annual Report to Shareholders, are incorporated herein
by reference.

In 1990, at the direction
of the UK Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), five insurance underwriting
subsidiaries of London United Investments PLC (LUI) suspended underwriting new
insurance business.  At the same time,
four of those subsidiaries, being insolvent, suspended payment of claims and
have since been placed in provisional liquidation.  The fifth subsidiary, Walbrook Insurance Company, continued
paying claims until May of 1992 when it was also placed in provisional
insolvent liquidation.  Weavers
Underwriting Agency (Weavers), an LUI subsidiary, managed these insurers.  Minet, a former insurance brokerage
subsidiary of ours, had brokered business to and from Weavers for many
years.  From 1973 through 1980, our
UK-based underwriting operations, now called St. Paul International Insurance
Company Ltd. (SPI), had accepted business from Weavers.  A portion of that business was ceded by SPI
to reinsurers.  Certain of those
reinsurers have challenged the validity of certain reinsurance contracts (or
the amount of recovery thereunder) relating to the Weavers pool, of which SPI
was a member, in an attempt to avoid liability under those contracts.  SPI and other members of the Weavers pool
are seeking enforcement of the reinsurance contracts.  Minet may also become the subject of legal proceedings arising
from its role as one of the major brokers for Weavers.  When we sold Minet in May 1997, we agreed to
indemnify the purchaser for most of Minet’s then existing liabilities,
including liabilities relating to the Weavers matter. We will vigorously
contest any proceedings relating to the Weavers matter.  We recognize that the final outcome of these
proceedings, if adverse to us, may materially impact the results of operations
in the period in which that outcome occurs. 
We believe that such an adverse outcome, however, will not have a
materially adverse effect on our liquidity or overall financial position.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’
REPORT ON FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULES

The Board of Directors
and Shareholders

The St. Paul Companies,
Inc.:

Under date of January 27,
2003, we reported on the consolidated balance sheets of The St. Paul Companies,
Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the related
consolidated statements of operations, shareholders’ equity, comprehensive
income and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended
December 31, 2002, as contained in the 2002 annual report to shareholders.  These consolidated financial statements and
our report thereon are incorporated by reference in the annual report on Form
10-K for the year 2002.  In connection
with our audits of the aforementioned consolidated financial statements we also
have audited the related financial statement schedules I through V, as listed
in the index in Item 15(a)2 of said Form 10-K. 
These financial statement schedules are the responsibility of the
Company’s management.  Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statement schedules
based on our audits.

In our opinion, such
financial statement schedules I through V, when considered in relation to the
basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in
all material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in the notes
to the consolidated financial statements, in 2001 the Company adopted the
provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133,
“Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” and, as also
described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002 the
Company adopted the provisions of the Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 141, “Business Combinations” and the Statement of Financial
Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.”
