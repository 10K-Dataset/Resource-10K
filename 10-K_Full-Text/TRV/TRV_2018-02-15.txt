PART I

Item 1.    BUSINESS

The Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the Company) is a holding company principally engaged,
through its subsidiaries, in providing a wide range of commercial and personal property and casualty insurance products and services to businesses, government units, associations and individuals. The
Company is incorporated as a general business
corporation under the laws of the State of Minnesota and is one of the oldest insurance organizations in the United States, dating back to 1853. The principal executive offices of the Company are
located at 485 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10017, and its telephone number is (917) 778-6000. The Company also maintains executive offices in Hartford, Connecticut, and
St. Paul, Minnesota. The term "TRV" in this document refers to The Travelers Companies, Inc., the parent holding company excluding subsidiaries.

For
a summary of the Company's revenues, core income and total assets by reportable business segments, see note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive in the areas of price, service, product offerings, agent relationships and
methods of distribution. Distribution methods include the use of independent agents, exclusive agents, direct marketing and/or salaried employees. According to A.M. Best, there are
approximately 1,200 property and casualty groups in the United States, comprising approximately 2,630 property and casualty companies. Of those groups, the top 150 accounted for approximately 92% of
the consolidated industry's total net written premiums in 2016. The Company competes with both foreign and domestic insurers. In addition, several property and casualty insurers writing commercial
lines of business, including the Company, offer products for alternative forms of risk protection in addition to traditional insurance products. These products include large deductible programs and
various forms of self-insurance, some of which utilize captive insurance companies and risk retention groups. The Company's competitive position in the marketplace is based on many factors, including
the following:

•

ability to profitably price business, retain existing customers and obtain new business;

•

premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered (including the ability to design customized programs);

•

agent, broker and policyholder relationships;

•

ability to keep pace relative to competitors with changes in technology and information systems;

•

speed of claims payment;

•

ability to provide products and services in a cost effective manner;

•

ability to provide new products and services to meet changing customer needs;

•

ability to adapt to changes in business models, technology, customer preferences or regulation impacting the markets in which the Company
operates;

•

perceived overall financial strength and corresponding ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;

•

reputation, experience and qualifications of employees;

•

geographic scope of business; and

•

local presence.



In
addition, the marketplace is affected by the available capacity of the insurance industry, as measured by statutory capital and surplus, and the availability of reinsurance from both
traditional sources, such as reinsurance companies and capital markets (through catastrophe bonds), and non-traditional sources, such as hedge funds and pension plans. Industry capacity as measured by
statutory capital and surplus expands and contracts primarily in conjunction with profit levels generated by the industry, less amounts returned to shareholders through dividends and share
repurchases. Capital raised by debt and equity offerings may also increase statutory capital and surplus.

Pricing and Underwriting

Pricing of the Company's property and casualty insurance products is generally developed based upon an estimation of expected losses, the
expenses associated with producing, issuing and servicing business and managing claims, the time value of money related to the expected loss and expense cash flows, and a reasonable profit margin that
considers the capital needed to support the Company's business. The Company has a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that emphasizes product returns and profitable growth over
the long-term rather than premium volume or market share. The Company's insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations regarding rate and policy form approvals. The applicable state
laws and regulations establish standards in certain lines of business to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory, or used to engage in unfair price competition. The
Company's ability to increase rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each respective state's requirements, as well as the competitive market environment.

Catastrophe Exposure

The Company's property and casualty insurance operations expose it to claims arising out of catastrophes. The Company uses various analyses and
methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to continually monitor and analyze underwriting risks of business in natural catastrophe-prone areas and target risk areas
for conventional terrorist attacks (defined as attacks other than nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events). The Company relies, in part, upon these analyses to make underwriting decisions
designed to manage its exposure on catastrophe-exposed business. For example, as a result of these analyses, the Company has at various times limited the writing of new property and homeowners
business in some markets and has selectively taken underwriting actions on new and existing business. These underwriting actions on new and existing business include tightening underwriting standards,
selective price increases and changes to deductibles specific to hurricane-, tornado-, wind- and hail-prone areas. See "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations—Catastrophe Modeling" and "—Changing Climate Conditions."
The Company also utilizes reinsurance to manage its aggregate exposures to catastrophes. See "—Reinsurance."

Segment Realignment

Effective April 1, 2017, the Company's results are reported in the following three business segments—Business Insurance,
Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, reflecting a change in the manner in which the Company's businesses were being managed as of that date, as well as the aggregation of products
and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which risks are underwritten. While the segmentation of the Company's domestic businesses was unchanged, the
Company's international businesses, which were previously managed and reported in total within the Business and International Insurance segment, were disaggregated by product type among the three
newly aligned reportable business segments. In connection with these changes, the Company revised the names and descriptions of certain businesses comprising the Company's segments and has reflected
other related changes. The following discussion of the Company's reportable business segments reflects the realigned segment reporting structure. Financial data for all prior periods presented was
reclassified to be consistent with the 2017 presentation.

Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

Business Insurance markets and distributes its products through approximately 10,500 independent agencies and brokers. Agencies and brokers are
serviced by 114 field offices and three customer service centers.

Business
Insurance builds relationships with well-established, independent insurance agencies and brokers. In selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products,
Business Insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency's or broker's financial strength, staff experience and strategic fit with the Company's operating and marketing plans. Once an agency
or broker is appointed, Business Insurance carefully monitors its performance. The majority of products offered in the United States are distributed through independent agents and brokers, many of
whom also sell the Company's Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance products. Additionally, several operations may underwrite business with agents that specialize in servicing the
needs of certain of the industries served by these operations. Business Insurance continues to make significant investments in enhanced technology to provide real-time interface capabilities with
independent agencies and brokers.

Domestic

•

Select Accounts

markets and distributes its products and services to small businesses,
generally with fewer than 50 employees, through a large network of independent agents and brokers. Products offered by Select Accounts are guaranteed-cost policies, including packaged products
covering property and liability exposures. Each small business risk is independently evaluated via an automated underwriting platform which in turn enables agents to quote, bind and issue a
substantial amount of new small business risks at their desktop in an efficient manner that significantly reduces the time period between quoting a price on a new policy and issuing that



policy.
Risks with more complex characteristics are underwritten with the assistance of Company personnel. Select Accounts has established a strong marketing relationship with its distribution network
and has provided this network with defined underwriting policies, a broad array of products and competitive prices. In addition, the Company has established centralized service centers to help agents
perform many service functions, in return for a fee.

•

Middle Market

markets and distributes its products and services primarily to mid-sized
businesses with 50 to 1,000 employees through a large network of independent agents and brokers. The Company offers a full line of products to its Middle Market customers with an emphasis on
guaranteed-cost programs. Each account is underwritten based on the unique risk characteristics, loss history and coverage needs of the account. The ability to underwrite at this detailed level allows
Middle Market to have a broad risk appetite and a diversified customer base. Within Middle Market, products and services are tailored to certain targeted industry segments of significant size and
complexity that require unique underwriting, claim, risk management or other insurance-related products and services.

•

National Accounts

markets and distributes its products and services to large companies through
a network of national and regional brokers, primarily utilizing loss-sensitive products in connection with a large deductible or self-insured program and, to a lesser extent, a retrospectively rated
or a guaranteed-cost insurance policy. National Accounts also provides casualty products and services through retail brokers on an unbundled basis, using third-party administrators for insureds who
utilize programs such as collateralized deductibles, captive reinsurers and self-insurance. National Accounts provides insurance-related services, such as risk management services, claims
administration, loss control and risk management information services, either in addition to, or in lieu of, pure risk coverage, and generated $252 million of fee income in 2017, excluding
commercial residual market business. The commercial residual market business of National Accounts sells claims and policy management services to workers' compensation pools throughout the United
States, and generated $120 million of fee income in 2017. National Accounts services approximately 36% of the total workers' compensation assigned risk market, making the Company one of the
largest servicing carriers in the industry. Workers' compensation accounted for approximately 71% of sales to National Accounts customers during 2017, based on direct written premiums and fees.

•

National Property and Other

markets and distributes its products and services to a wide
customer base, providing traditional and customized insurance programs to a broad range of customer sizes through a large network of agents and brokers. National Property and Other also markets and
distributes its products through brokers, wholesale agents, program managers and specialized retail agents who operate in certain markets that are not typically served by the Company's appointed
retail agents, or who maintain certain affinity arrangements in specialized market segments. The wholesale excess and surplus lines market, which is characterized by the absence of rate and form
regulation, allows for more pricing and coverage flexibility to write certain classes of business. In working with agents or program managers on a brokerage basis, National Property and Other
underwrites the business internally and sets the premium level. In working with agents or program managers with delegated underwriting authority, the agents produce and underwrite business subject to
pricing and underwriting guidelines that have been specifically designed for each facility or program.

International

markets and distributes its products principally through brokers in each of the countries in which it operates.
International also writes business at Lloyd's, where its products are distributed through Lloyd's wholesale and retail brokers. By virtue of Lloyd's worldwide licenses, Business Insurance has access
to international markets across the world.



Pricing and Underwriting

Business Insurance utilizes underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product development disciplines for particular industries, in
conjunction with extensive amounts of proprietary data gathered and analyzed over many years, to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters. The Company utilizes both
standard industry forms and proprietary forms for the insurance policies it issues.

A
portion of business in this segment, particularly in National Accounts and Construction, is written with large deductible insurance policies. Under workers' compensation insurance
contracts with large deductible features, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant the full amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible
amount and is subject to credit risk until such reimbursement is made. At December 31, 2017, contractholder payables on unpaid losses within the deductible layer of large deductible policies
and the associated receivables were both approximately $4.77 billion. Business Insurance also utilizes retrospectively rated policies for another portion of the business, primarily for workers'
compensation coverage. Although the retrospectively rated feature of the policy substantially reduces insurance risk for the Company, it introduces additional credit risk to the Company. Premiums
receivable from holders of retrospectively rated policies totaled approximately $93 million at December 31, 2017. Significant collateral, primarily letters of credit and, to a lesser
extent, cash collateral, trusts or surety bonds, is generally obtained for large deductible plans and/or retrospectively rated policies that provide for deferred collection of deductible recoveries
and/or ultimate premiums. The amount of collateral requested is predicated upon the creditworthiness of the customer and the nature of the insured risks. Business Insurance continually monitors the
credit exposure on individual accounts and the adequacy of collateral. For additional information concerning credit risk in certain of the Company's businesses, see "Item 1A—Risk
Factors—We are also exposed to credit risk in certain of our insurance operations and with respect to certain guarantee or indemnification arrangements that we have with third parties."

Product Lines

Business Insurance provides the following types of products and services:

Domestic

•

Workers' Compensation.

Provides
coverage for employers for specified benefits payable under state or federal law for workplace injuries to employees. There are typically four types of benefits payable under workers' compensation
policies: medical benefits, disability benefits, death benefits and vocational rehabilitation benefits. The Company emphasizes managed care cost containment strategies, which involve employers,
employees and care providers in a cooperative effort that focuses on the injured employee's early return to work and cost-effective quality care. The Company offers the following types of workers'
compensation products:

•

guaranteed-cost insurance products, where the premiums charged will not be adjusted for actual loss experience during the covered
period;

•

loss-sensitive insurance products, including large deductible and retrospectively rated policies, in which fees or premiums are
adjusted based on actual loss experience of the insured during the policy period; and

•

service programs, which are generally sold to the Company's National Accounts customers, where the Company receives fees rather
than premiums for providing loss prevention, risk management, and claim and benefit administration services to organizations under service agreements.

The
Company also participates in state assigned risk pools as a servicing carrier and pool participant.



•

Commercial Automobile.

Provides
coverage for businesses against losses incurred from personal bodily injury, bodily injury to third parties, property damage to an insured's vehicle and property damage to other vehicles and other
property resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of automobiles and trucks in a business.

•

Commercial Property.

Provides
coverage for loss of or damage to buildings, inventory and equipment from a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes and other windstorms, tornadoes, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe
winter weather, floods, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, theft, vandalism, fires, explosions, terrorism and financial loss due to business interruption resulting from covered property damage. For
additional information on terrorism coverages, see "Reinsurance—Catastrophe Reinsurance—Terrorism Risk Insurance Program." Commercial property also includes specialized
equipment insurance, which provides coverage for loss or damage resulting from the mechanical breakdown of boilers and machinery, and ocean and inland marine insurance, which provides coverage for
goods in transit and unique, one-of-a-kind exposures.

•

General Liability.

Provides
coverages for businesses against third-party claims arising from accidents occurring on their premises or arising out of their operations, including as a result of injuries sustained from products
sold. Coverages may also include directors' and officers' liability arising in their official capacities, employment practices liability insurance, fiduciary liability for trustees and sponsors of
pension, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans, errors and omissions insurance for employees, agents, professionals and others arising from acts or failures to act under specified
circumstances, as well as umbrella and excess insurance.

•

Commercial Multi-Peril.

Provides
a combination of the property and liability coverages described in the foregoing product line descriptions.

International

•

Provides coverage for employers' liability (similar to workers' compensation coverage in the United States), public and product liability (the
equivalent of general liability), professional indemnity (similar to professional liability coverage), commercial property, commercial automobile, marine, aviation, personal accident and
kidnap & ransom. Marine provides coverage for ship hulls, cargoes carried, private yachts, marine-related liability, offshore energy, ports and terminals, fine art and terrorism. Aviation
provides coverage for worldwide aviation risks including physical damage and liabilities for airline, aerospace, general aviation, aviation war and space risks. Personal accident provides financial
protection in the event of death or disablement due to accidental bodily injury, while kidnap & ransom provides financial protection against kidnap, hijack, illegal detention and extortion.
While the covered hazards may be similar to those in the U.S. market, the different legal environments can make the product risks and coverage terms potentially very different from those the Company
faces in the United States.

Net Retention Policy Per Risk

The following discussion reflects the Company's retention policy with respect to Business Insurance as of January 1, 2018. For
third-party liability, Business Insurance generally limits its net retention, through the use of reinsurance, to a maximum of $16.0 million per insured, per occurrence. For property exposures,
Business Insurance generally limits its net retention, through the use of reinsurance, to a maximum amount per risk of $20.0 million per occurrence. Business Insurance generally retains its
workers' compensation exposures. Reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per-risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached. Business
Insurance utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce



retentions
on an individual risk basis. Business Insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

Competition

The insurance industry is represented in the commercial marketplace by many insurance companies of varying size as well as other entities
offering risk alternatives, such as self-insured retentions or captive programs. Market competition works within the insurance regulatory framework to set the price charged for insurance products and
the levels of coverage and service provided. A company's success in the competitive commercial insurance landscape is largely measured by its ability to profitably provide insurance and services,
including claims handling and risk control, at prices and terms that retain existing customers and attract new customers. See "Item 1A—Risk Factors—The intense
competition that we face, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which we operate, could harm our ability to
maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability."

Domestic

Competitors typically write Select Accounts business through independent agents and, to a lesser extent, regional brokers, and as direct
writers. Both national (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) and regional property and casualty insurance companies compete in the Select Accounts market which generally
comprises lower-hazard, "Main Street" business customers. Risks are underwritten and priced using standard industry practices and a combination of proprietary and



standard
industry product offerings. Competition in this market is primarily based on breadth of product offerings, service levels, ease and speed of doing business and price.

Competitors
typically write Middle Market business through independent agents and brokers. Several of Middle Market's operations require unique combinations of industry knowledge,
customized coverage, specialized risk control and loss handling services, along with partnerships with agents and brokers that also focus on these markets. Competitors in this market are primarily
national property and casualty insurance companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) that write most classes of business using traditional products and pricing, and
regional insurance companies. Companies compete based on product offerings, service levels, price and claim and loss prevention services. Efficiency through automation and response time to agent,
broker and customer needs is one key to success in this market.

In
the National Accounts market, competition is based on price, product offerings, claim and loss prevention services, managed care cost containment, risk management information systems
and collateral requirements. National Accounts primarily competes with national property and casualty insurance companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.), as well as
with other underwriters of property and casualty insurance in the alternative risk transfer market, such as self-insurance plans, captives managed by others, and a variety of other risk-financing
vehicles and mechanisms. The residual market division competes for state contracts to provide claims and policy management services.

National
Property and Other competes in focused target markets. Each of these markets is different and requires unique combinations of industry knowledge, customized coverage,
specialized risk control and loss handling services, along with partnerships with agents and brokers that also focus on these markets. Some of these businesses compete with national carriers
(including international companies doing business in the U.S.) with similarly dedicated underwriting and marketing groups, whereas others compete with smaller regional companies. Specialized agents
and brokers, including wholesale agents and program managers, supplement this focused target market approach. National Property and Other's competitive strategy typically is based on the application
of focused industry knowledge to insurance and risk needs.

International

International competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Brazil.
Companies compete on the basis of price, product offerings, distribution partnerships and the level of claim and risk management services provided. The Company has developed expertise in various
markets in these countries similar to those served in the United States and provides both property and casualty coverage for these markets.

At
Lloyd's, International competes with other syndicates operating in the Lloyd's market as well as international and domestic insurers in the various markets where the Lloyd's operation
writes business worldwide. Competition is based on price, product and service. The Company focuses on lines it believes it can underwrite profitably with an emphasis on short-tail insurance lines.



BOND & SPECIALTY INSURANCE

Bond & Specialty Insurance provides surety, fidelity, management liability, professional liability, and other property and casualty
coverages and related risk management services to its customers in the United States and certain specialty insurance products in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Brazil,
utilizing various degrees of financially based underwriting approaches. The range of coverages includes performance, payment and commercial surety and fidelity bonds for construction and general
commercial enterprises; management liability coverages including directors' and officers' liability, employee dishonesty, employment practices liability, fiduciary liability and cyber risk for public
corporations, private companies, not-for-profit organizations and financial institutions; professional liability coverage for a variety of professionals including, among others, lawyers and design
professionals; and in the United States only, property, workers' compensation, auto and general liability for financial institutions.

Bond &
Specialty Insurance surety business in Brazil and Colombia is conducted through J. Malucelli Participações em Seguros e
Resseguros S.A. (JMalucelli) and J. Malucelli Latam S.A. in Brazil. The Company owns 49.5% of both JMalucelli, a market leader in surety coverages in Brazil, and
J. Malucelli Latam S.A., which in September 2015 acquired a majority interest in JMalucelli Travelers Seguros S.A., a Colombian start-up surety provider. These joint venture
investments are accounted for using the equity method and are included in "other investments" on the consolidated balance sheet.

Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

Bond & Specialty Insurance markets and distributes the vast majority of its products in the United States through approximately 5,600 of
the same independent agencies and brokers that distribute Business Insurance's products in the United States. Bond & Specialty Insurance builds relationships with well-established, independent
insurance agencies and brokers. In selecting new independent agencies and brokers to distribute its products, Bond & Specialty Insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency's or
broker's profitability, financial stability, staff experience and strategic fit with its operating and marketing plans. Once an agency or broker is appointed, its ongoing performance is closely
monitored. Bond & Specialty Insurance, in conjunction with Business Insurance, continues to make investments in enhanced technology to provide real-time interface capabilities with its
independent agencies and brokers.



Pricing and Underwriting

Bond & Specialty Insurance utilizes underwriting, claims, engineering, actuarial and product development disciplines for specific
accounts and industries, in conjunction with extensive amounts of proprietary data gathered and analyzed over many years, to facilitate its risk selection process and develop pricing parameters. The
Company utilizes both standard industry forms and proprietary forms for the insurance policies it issues.

Product Lines

Bond & Specialty Insurance writes the following types of coverages:

Domestic

•

Fidelity and Surety.

Provides
fidelity insurance coverage, which protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee, and surety, which is a three-party agreement whereby the insurer agrees
to pay a third party or complete an obligation in response to the default, acts or omissions of an insured. Surety is generally provided for construction performance, legal matters such as appeals,
trustees in bankruptcy and probate and other performance bonds.

•

General Liability.

Provides
coverage for specialized liability exposures as described above in more detail in the "Business Insurance" section of this report, as well as cyber risk coverages.

•

Other.

Coverages include
Property, Workers' Compensation, Commercial Automobile and Commercial Multi-Peril, which are described above in more detail in the "Business Insurance" section of this report.

International

•

Fidelity and Surety and certain General Liability products are provided internationally to various customer groups.

Net Retention Policy Per Risk

The following discussion reflects the Company's retention policy with respect to Bond & Specialty Insurance as of January 1, 2018.
For third party liability, including but not limited to umbrella liability, professional liability, directors' and officers' liability, employment practices liability and cyber risk liability,
Bond & Specialty Insurance generally limits net retentions to $25.0 million per policy. For surety protection, where insured limits are often significant, Bond & Specialty
Insurance generally retains up to $115.0 million probable maximum loss (PML) per principal, after reinsurance, but may retain higher amounts based on the type of obligation, credit quality and
other credit risk factors. Reinsurance treaties often have aggregate limits or caps which may result in larger net per risk retentions if the aggregate limits or caps are reached. Bond &
Specialty Insurance utilizes facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. Bond & Specialty Insurance may also retain
amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

Competition

The competitive landscape in which Bond & Specialty Insurance operates is affected by many of the same factors described previously for
Business Insurance. Competitors in this market are primarily national property and casualty insurance companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) that write most classes
of business and, to a lesser extent, regional insurance companies and companies that have developed niche programs for specific industry segments.

Domestic

Bond & Specialty Insurance underwrites and markets its products to all sizes of businesses and other organizations, as well as
individuals. The Company believes that its reputation for timely and consistent decision making, a nationwide network of local underwriting, claims and industry experts and strong producer and
customer relationships, as well as its ability to offer its customers a full range of products, provides Bond & Specialty Insurance an advantage over many of its competitors and enables it to
compete effectively in a complex, dynamic marketplace. The Company believes that
the ability of Bond & Specialty Insurance to cross-sell its products to customers of Business Insurance and Personal Insurance provides additional competitive advantages for the Company. See
"Item 1A—Risk Factors—The intense competition that we face, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance
industry and the markets in which we operate, could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability."



International

International competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Brazil.
Companies compete on the basis of price, product offerings and the level of claim and risk management services provided. The Company has developed expertise in various markets in these countries
similar to those served in the United States and provides certain specialty coverages for these markets.

PERSONAL INSURANCE

Personal Insurance writes a broad range of property and casualty insurance covering individuals' personal risks, primarily in the United States,
as well as in Canada. The primary products of automobile and homeowners insurance are complemented by a broad suite of related coverages.

Principal Markets and Methods of Distribution

Domestic

Personal Insurance products are marketed and distributed primarily through approximately 10,300 active independent agencies located throughout
the United States, supported by personnel in eight sales regions. In addition, sales and service are provided to customers through five contact centers. While the principal markets for Personal
Insurance products continue to be in states along the East Coast, California and Texas, the business continues to expand its geographic presence across the United States.

In
selecting new independent agencies to distribute its products, Personal Insurance considers, among other attributes, each agency's profitability, financial stability, staff experience
and strategic fit with its operating and marketing plans. Once an agency is appointed, Personal Insurance carefully monitors its performance.

Agents
can access the Company's agency service portal for a number of resources including customer service, marketing and claims management. In addition, agencies can choose to shift the
ongoing service responsibility for Personal Insurance's customers to one of the Company's Customer Care Centers, where the Company provides, on behalf of an agency, a comprehensive array of



customer
service needs, including response to billing and coverage inquiries, and policy changes. Approximately 1,500 agents take advantage of this service alternative, for which they generally pay a
fee.

Personal
Insurance also markets and distributes its products through additional channels, including corporations that make the Company's product offerings available to their employees
primarily through payroll deductions, consumer associations and affinity groups. Personal Insurance handles the sales and service for these programs either through a sponsoring independent agent or
through the Company's contact center locations. In addition, since 1995, the Company has had a marketing agreement with GEICO to underwrite homeowners business for certain of their auto customers.

The
Company also markets its insurance products directly to consumers, largely through online channels. The Company's direct-to-consumer business continues to grow but still represents
modest premium volume for Personal Insurance, which is expected to continue for a number of years. The Company's direct-to-consumer business is also expected to be slightly unprofitable for a number
of years.

International

International markets and distributes its products principally through approximately 640 brokers located throughout Canada.

Pricing and Underwriting

Personal Insurance has developed a product management methodology that integrates the disciplines of underwriting, claims, actuarial and product
development. This approach is designed to maintain high-quality underwriting discipline and pricing segmentation. Proprietary and third-party data accumulated over many years is analyzed and Personal
Insurance uses a variety of risk differentiation models to facilitate its pricing segmentation and underwriting. The Company's product management area establishes underwriting guidelines integrated
with its filed pricing and rating plans, which enable Personal Insurance to effectively execute its risk selection and pricing processes.

Domestic

Pricing for personal automobile insurance is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and changes in severity, including
inflation in the cost of automobile repairs, medical care and resolution of liability claims. Pricing in the homeowners business is driven in large part by changes in the frequency of claims and
changes in severity, including inflation in the cost of building supplies, labor and household possessions. In addition to the normal risks associated with any multiple peril coverage, the
profitability and pricing of both homeowners and automobile insurance are affected by the incidence of natural disasters, particularly those related to weather and, for homeowners insurance,
earthquakes. Insurers writing personal lines property and casualty policies may be unable to increase prices until some time after the costs associated with coverage have increased, primarily because
of state insurance rate regulation. The pace at which an insurer can change rates in response to increased costs depends, in part, on whether the applicable state law requires prior approval of rate
increases or notification to the regulator either before or after a rate change is imposed. In states with prior approval laws, rates must be approved by the regulator before being used by the
insurer. In states having "file-and-use" laws, the insurer must file rate changes with the regulator, but does not need to wait for approval before using the new rates. A "use-and-file" law requires
an insurer to file rates within a period of time after the insurer begins using the new rate. Approximately one-half of the states require prior approval of most rate changes. In addition, changes to
methods of marketing and underwriting in some jurisdictions are subject to state-imposed restrictions, which can make it more difficult for an insurer to significantly manage catastrophe exposures.



The
Company's ability or willingness to raise prices, modify underwriting terms or reduce exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public policy, the
competitive environment, the evolving political environment and/or changes in the general economic climate. The Company also may choose to write business it might not otherwise write in some states
for strategic purposes, such as improving access to other commercial or personal underwriting opportunities. In choosing to write business in some states, the Company also considers the costs and
benefits of those states' residual markets and guaranty funds, as well as other property and casualty business the Company writes in those states.

International

Pricing and underwriting for personal automobile and homeowners insurance in Canada is driven in large part by the same factors as in the United
States. For personal automobile insurance, all provinces in Canada require prior approval before rates are implemented.

Product Lines

Domestic

The primary coverages in Personal Insurance are personal automobile and homeowners and other insurance sold to individuals. Personal Insurance
had approximately 7.2 million active policies (e.g., policies-in-force) in the United States at December 31, 2017.

Personal
Insurance writes the following types of coverages:

•

Personal Automobile

provides coverage for liability to others for both bodily injury and
property damage, uninsured motorist protection, and for physical damage to an insured's own vehicle from collision, fire, flood, hail and theft. In addition, many states require policies to provide
first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.

•

Homeowners and Other

provides protection against losses to residences and contents from a
variety of perils (excluding flooding) as well as coverage for personal liability. The Company writes homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and tenants, and rental properties. The Company
also writes coverage for boats and yachts and valuable personal items such as jewelry, and also writes coverages for umbrella liability, identity fraud, and weddings and special events.

International

•

International

provides automobile and homeowners and other coverages in Canada (similar to
coverages in the United States). Personal Insurance had approximately 562,000 active policies in Canada at December 31, 2017.

Net Retention Policy Per Risk

The following discussion reflects the Company's retention policy with respect to Personal Insurance as of January 1, 2018. Personal
Insurance generally retains its primary personal auto exposures in their entirety. For personal property insurance, there is an $8.0 million maximum retention per risk, net of reinsurance.
Personal Insurance uses facultative reinsurance to provide additional limits capacity or to reduce retentions on an individual risk basis. Personal Insurance issues umbrella policies up to a maximum
limit of $10.0 million per risk. Personal Insurance may also retain amounts greater than those described herein based upon the individual characteristics of the risk.

Competition

Domestic

Although national companies (including international companies doing business in the U.S.) write the majority of this business, Personal
Insurance also faces competition from many regional and hundreds of local companies. Personal Insurance primarily competes based on breadth of product offerings, price, service (including claims
handling), ease and speed of doing business, stability of the insurer and name recognition. Personal Insurance competes for business within each independent agency since these agencies also offer
policies of competing companies. At the agency level, competition is primarily based on price, service (including claims handling), the level of automation and the development of long-term
relationships with individual agents. In recent years, most independent personal insurance agents have begun utilizing price comparison rating technology, sometimes referred to as "comparative
raters," as a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple companies. Because the use of this technology facilitates the process of generating multiple quotes, the technology has increased
price comparison on new business and, increasingly, on renewal business. Personal Insurance also competes with insurance companies that use exclusive agents or salaried employees to sell their
products, as well as those that employ direct marketing strategies.



International

Personal Insurance competes with numerous international and domestic insurers in Canada. Companies compete on the basis of price, breadth of
product offerings and the level of claim and risk management services provided. The Company has developed expertise in various markets in Canada similar to those served in the United States and
provides both automobile and homeowners and other coverages for this market.

See
"Item 1A—Risk Factors—The intense competition that we face, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the
insurance industry and the markets in which we operate, could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability."

CLAIMS MANAGEMENT

The Company's claim functions are managed through its Claims Services organization, with locations in the United States and in the other
countries where it does business. With more than 11,000 employees, Claims Services employs a group of professionals with diverse skills, including claim adjusters, appraisers, attorneys,
investigators, engineers, accountants, nurses, data and analytics professionals, system specialists and training, management and support personnel. Approved external service providers, such as
investigators, attorneys and, when necessary, independent adjusters and appraisers, are available for use as appropriate.

United
States field claim management teams located in 20 claim centers and 53 satellite and specialty-only offices in 44 states are organized to maintain focus on the specific claim
characteristics unique to the businesses within the Company's business segments. Claim teams with specialized skills, required licenses, resources and workflows are matched to the unique exposures of
those businesses, with local claims management dedicated to achieving optimal results within each segment. The Company's home office operations provide additional support in the form of workflow
design, quality management, information technology, advanced management information and data analysis, training, financial reporting and control, and human resources strategy. This structure permits
the Company to maintain the economies of scale of a large, established company while retaining the agility to respond promptly to the needs of customers, brokers, agents and underwriters. Claims
management for International, while generally provided locally by staff in the respective international locations due to local knowledge of applicable laws and regulations, is also managed by the
Company's Claims Services organization in the United States to leverage that knowledge base and to share best practices.

An
integral part of the Company's strategy to benefit customers and shareholders is its continuing industry leadership in the fight against insurance fraud through its Investigative
Services unit. The Company has a nationwide staff of experts who investigate a wide array of insurance fraud schemes using in-house forensic resources and other technological tools. This staff also
has specialized expertise in fire scene examinations, medical provider fraud schemes and data mining. The Company also dedicates investigative resources to ensure that violations of law are reported
to and prosecuted by law enforcement agencies.

Claims
Services uses technology, management information and data analysis to assist the Company in reviewing its claim practices and results in order to evaluate and improve its claims
management performance. The Company's claims-management strategy is focused on segmentation of claims and appropriate technical specialization to drive effective claim resolution. The Company
continually monitors its investment in claim resources to maintain an effective focus on claim outcomes and a disciplined approach to continual improvement. The Company operates a state-of-the-art
claims-training facility which offers hands-on experiential learning to help ensure that its claim professionals are properly trained. In recent years, the Company has invested significant additional
resources in many of its claim-handling operations, including the utilization of drone technology, and routinely monitors the effect of those investments to ensure a consistent optimization among
outcomes, cost and service.



Claims Services' catastrophe response strategy is to respond to a significant catastrophic event using its own personnel, enabling it to minimize reliance on
independent adjusters and appraisers. The Company has developed a large dedicated catastrophe response team and trained a large Enterprise Response Team of existing employees who can be deployed on
short notice in the event of a catastrophe that generates claim volume exceeding the capacity of the dedicated catastrophe response team. In recent years, these internal resources were successfully
deployed to respond to a record number of catastrophe claims.

REINSURANCE

The Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to manage its exposure to losses and to protect its capital. The Company
cedes to reinsurers a portion of these risks and pays premiums based upon the risk and exposure of the policies subject to such reinsurance. The Company utilizes a variety of reinsurance agreements to
manage its exposure to large property and
casualty losses, including catastrophe, treaty, facultative and quota share reinsurance. Ceded reinsurance involves credit risk, except with regard to mandatory pools and associations, and is
predominantly subject to aggregate loss limits. Although the reinsurer is liable to the Company to the extent of the reinsurance ceded, the Company remains liable as the direct insurer on all risks
reinsured. Reinsurance recoverables are reported after reductions for known insolvencies and after allowances for uncollectible amounts. The Company also holds collateral, including trust agreements,
escrow funds and letters of credit, under certain reinsurance agreements. The Company monitors the financial condition of reinsurers on an ongoing basis and reviews its reinsurance arrangements
periodically. Reinsurers are selected based on their financial condition, business practices, the price of their product offerings and the value of collateral provided. After reinsurance is purchased,
the Company has limited ability to manage the credit risk to a reinsurer. In addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the European Union and the United Kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to
transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory
and/or court authority.

For
additional information regarding reinsurance, see note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial statements and "Item 1A—Risk Factors." For a description of
reinsurance-related litigation, see note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Catastrophe Reinsurance

Catastrophes can be caused by a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail,
wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also result from terrorist attacks and other
intentionally destructive acts including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure. The incidence and severity
of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure affected by the event and the severity of the event.
Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in larger areas, especially those areas that are heavily populated. The
Company generally seeks to manage its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance. In addition to the Company's catastrophe reinsurance
coverages, the Company is also party to other reinsurance treaties that can provide additional coverage for losses arising from catastrophes, as described in the "Net Retention Policy Per Risk"
sections of the respective segment discussions above. The Company conducts an ongoing review of its risk and catastrophe coverages and from time to time makes changes as it deems appropriate. The
following discussion summarizes the Company's catastrophe reinsurance coverage at January 1, 2018.



Corporate Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.

This treaty covers the accumulation of certain property losses arising from
one or multiple
occurrences for the period January 1, 2018 through and including December 31, 2018. The treaty provides for recovery of 75% of the dollar amount of each qualifying loss in excess of a
$3.0 billion retention, up to a maximum amount of qualifying losses of $2.0 billion. Therefore, the maximum recovery under the treaty would be $1.5 billion. Qualifying losses for
each occurrence are after a $100 million deductible. The treaty covers all of the Company's exposures in the United States and Canada and their territories and possessions, the Caribbean
Islands, Mexico and all waters contiguous thereto. The treaty only provides coverage for terrorism events in limited circumstances and excludes entirely losses arising from nuclear, biological,
chemical or radiological attacks.

Catastrophe Bonds.

The Company has catastrophe protection through an indemnity reinsurance agreement with Long Point Re III Ltd.
(Long Point
Re III), an independent Cayman Islands company licensed as a Class C insurer in the Cayman Islands. The reinsurance agreement expires in May 2018 and meets the requirements to be accounted for
as reinsurance in accordance with the guidance for reinsurance contracts. In connection with the reinsurance agreement, Long Point Re III issued notes (generally referred to as "catastrophe bonds") to
investors in amounts equal to the full coverage provided under the reinsurance agreement as described below. The proceeds were deposited in a reinsurance trust account. The businesses covered by this
reinsurance agreement are subsets of the Company's overall insurance portfolio, comprising specified property coverages spread across the following geographic locations: Connecticut, Delaware,
District of Columbia, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia and Vermont.

The
reinsurance agreement with Long Point Re III provides coverage of up to $300 million to the Company for losses from tropical cyclones, earthquakes, severe thunderstorms or
winter storms in the locations listed above. The attachment point and maximum limit under this agreement are reset annually to adjust the expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. Until
and including May 15, 2018, the Company is entitled to begin recovering amounts under this reinsurance agreement if the covered losses in the covered area for a single occurrence reach an
initial attachment amount of $2.346 billion. The full $300 million coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such covered losses reach a maximum $2.846 billion.
The coverage under the reinsurance agreement is limited to specified property coverage written in Personal Insurance; Select Accounts, Middle Market (excluding Excess Casualty and Boiler &
Machinery) and National Property and Other in Business Insurance; and Bond & Specialty Insurance Other in Bond & Specialty Insurance.

Under
the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the Company is obligated to pay annual reinsurance premiums to Long Point Re III for the reinsurance coverage. Amounts payable to the
Company under the reinsurance agreement with respect to any covered event cannot exceed the Company's actual losses from such event. The principal amount of the catastrophe bonds will be reduced by
any amounts paid to the Company under the reinsurance agreement.

As
with any reinsurance agreement, there is credit risk associated with collecting amounts due from reinsurers. With regard to Long Point Re III, the credit risk is mitigated by a
reinsurance trust account that has been funded by Long Point Re III with money market funds that invest solely in direct government obligations and obligations backed by the U.S. government with
maturities of no more than 13 months. The money market funds must have a principal stability rating of at least AAAm by Standard & Poor's on the issuance date of the bonds and thereafter
must be rated by Standard & Poor's. Other permissible investments include money market funds which invest in repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements collateralized by direct government
obligations and obligations of any agency backed by the U.S. government with terms of no more than 397 calendar days, and cash.



At
the time the agreement was entered into with Long Point Re III, the Company evaluated the applicability of the accounting guidance that addresses variable interest entities or VIEs.
Under this guidance, an entity that is formed for business purposes is considered a VIE if: (a) the equity investors lack the direct or indirect ability through voting rights or similar rights
to make decisions about an entity's activities that have a significant effect on the entity's operations or (b) the equity investors do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity
to support its activities. Additionally, a company that absorbs a majority of the expected losses from a VIE's activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity's expected residual
returns, or both, is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE and is required to consolidate the VIE in the company's financial statements.

As
a result of the evaluation of the reinsurance agreement with Long Point Re III, the Company concluded that it was a VIE because the conditions described in items (a) and
(b) above were present. However, while Long Point Re III was determined to be a VIE, the Company concluded that it did not have a variable interest in the entity, as the variability in its
results, caused by the reinsurance agreement, is expected to be absorbed entirely by the investors in the catastrophe bonds issued by Long Point Re III and residual amounts earned by it, if any, are
expected to be absorbed by the equity investors (the Company has neither an equity nor a residual interest in Long Point Re III).

Accordingly,
the Company is not the primary beneficiary of Long Point Re III and does not consolidate that entity in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Additionally,
because the Company has no intention to pursue any transaction that would result in it acquiring interest in and becoming the primary beneficiary of Long Point Re III, the consolidation of that entity
in the Company's consolidated financial statements in future periods is unlikely.

The
Company has not incurred any losses that have resulted or are expected to result in a recovery under the Long Point Re III agreement since its inception.

Northeast Property Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.

This treaty provides up to $800 million part of
$850 million of all
perils (coverage for terrorism events in limited circumstances and excludes entirely losses from nuclear, biological and radiological attacks), subject to a $2.25 billion retention, from
Virginia to Maine for the period July 1, 2017 through and including June 30, 2018. Losses from a covered event (occurring over several days) anywhere in the United States, Canada, the
Caribbean and Mexico and waters contiguous thereto may be used to satisfy the retention. Recoveries under the catastrophe bonds (if any) would be first applied to reduce losses subject to this treaty.

Middle Market Earthquake Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.

This treaty provides for up to $150 million part of
$165 million of coverage, subject to an $80 million retention, for losses arising from an earthquake, including fire following and sprinkler leakage incurred under policies written by
Technology, Public Sector Services and Commercial Accounts in Business Insurance for the period July 1, 2017 through and including June 30, 2018.

Personal Insurance Earthquake Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.

This treaty provides for up to $200 million of
coverage, subject
to a $150 million retention, for losses arising from an earthquake, including fire following and sprinkler leakage incurred under policies written by Personal Insurance for the period
January 1, 2018 through and including December 31, 2018.

Canadian Property Catastrophe Excess-of-Loss Reinsurance Treaty.

This treaty, effective for the period July 1, 2017 through and
including
June 30, 2018, covers the accumulation of net property losses arising out of one occurrence on business written by the Company's Canadian businesses. The treaty covers all property written by
the Company's Canadian businesses for Canadian insureds, including, but not limited to, habitational property, commercial property, inland marine, ocean marine and auto physical damages exposures,
with respect to risks located worldwide, written for Canadian insureds. The treaty provides coverage for 50% of losses in excess of C$100 million (US$80 million at December 31,
2017), up to C$200 million (US$160 million at December 31, 2017) and for 100% of losses in excess of



C$200 million
(US$160 million at December 31, 2017), up to C$600 million (US$479 million at December 31, 2017).

Other International Reinsurance Treaties.

For other business underwritten in Canada, as well as for business written in the United
Kingdom, the
Republic of Ireland, Brazil and in the Company's operations at Lloyd's, separate reinsurance protections are purchased locally that have lower net retentions more commensurate with the size of the
respective local balance sheet.

Terrorism Risk Insurance Program.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program is a Federal program administered by the Department of the
Treasury authorized
through December 31, 2020 that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism. For a further description
of the program, including the Company's estimated deductible under the program in 2018, see note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial statements and "Item 1A—Risk
Factors—Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to
raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance."

CLAIMS AND CLAIM ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES

Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of ultimate unpaid costs of losses and loss adjustment expenses for
claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported.

The
Company continually refines its reserve estimates as part of a regular ongoing process that includes reviews of key assumptions, underlying variables and historical loss experience.
The Company reflects adjustments to reserves in the results of operations in the periods in which the estimates are changed. In establishing reserves, the Company takes into account estimated
recoveries for reinsurance, salvage and subrogation. The reserves are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company. For additional information on the process of estimating
reserves and a discussion of underlying variables and risk factors, see "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates."

The
process of estimating loss reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables (discussed by product line in the "Critical Accounting
Estimates" section of "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations") are affected by both internal and external events, such as
changes in claims handling procedures, inflation, judicial trends and the legislative landscape, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment
expenses is difficult to estimate. Reserve estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in the underlying insurance contract (e.g., claims-made versus
occurrence), claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of the occurrence date for a claim, and reporting lags (the time between the
occurrence of the insured event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process.

The
Company derives estimates for unreported claims and development with respect to reported claims principally from actuarial analyses of historical patterns of loss development by
accident year for each business unit, product line and type of exposure. Similarly, the Company derives estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses principally from actuarial analyses of historical
development patterns and the relationship of loss adjustment expenses to losses for each product line and type of exposure. For a description of the Company's reserving methods for asbestos and
environmental claims, see "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Asbestos Claims and Litigation," and
"—Environmental Claims and Litigation."



Certain
of the Company's claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are discounted to present value. See note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further
discussion.

Reserves on Statutory Accounting Basis

At December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (net of reinsurance) prepared in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP reserves) were $56 million higher, $44 million higher and $41 million higher, respectively, than those reported in the Company's
respective annual reports filed with insurance regulators, which are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices (statutory reserves).

The
differences between GAAP and statutory reserves are primarily due to the differences in GAAP and statutory accounting for two items: (1) fees associated with billing of
required reimbursements under large deductible business and (2) the accounting for retroactive reinsurance. For large deductible business, the Company pays the deductible portion of a casualty
insurance claim and then seeks reimbursement from the insured, plus a fee. This fee is reported as fee income for GAAP reporting, but as an offset to claim expenses paid for statutory reporting.
Retroactive reinsurance balances result from reinsurance placed to cover losses on insured events occurring prior to the inception of a reinsurance contract. For GAAP reporting, retroactive
reinsurance balances are included in reinsurance recoverables and result in lower net reserve amounts. Statutory accounting practices require retroactive reinsurance balances to be recorded in other
liabilities as contra-liabilities rather than in loss reserves.

Asbestos and Environmental Claims

Asbestos and environmental claims are segregated from other claims and are handled separately by the Company's Special Liability Group, a
separate unit staffed by dedicated legal, claim, finance and engineering professionals. For additional information on asbestos and environmental claims, see "Item 7—Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Asbestos Claims and Litigation" and "—Environmental Claims and Litigation."

INTERCOMPANY REINSURANCE POOLING ARRANGEMENTS

Most of the Company's domestic insurance subsidiaries are members of an intercompany property and casualty reinsurance pooling arrangement.
Pooling arrangements permit the participating companies to rely on the capacity of the entire pool's statutory capital and surplus rather than just on its own statutory capital and surplus. Under such
arrangements, the members share substantially all insurance business that is written and allocate the combined premiums, losses and expenses.

RATINGS

Ratings are an important factor in assessing the Company's competitive position in the insurance industry. The Company receives ratings from the
following major rating agencies: A.M. Best Company (A.M. Best), Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's Corp. (S&P). Rating agencies typically
issue two types of ratings for insurance companies: claims-paying (or financial strength) ratings, which reflect the rating agency's assessment of an insurer's ability to meet its financial
obligations to policyholders, and debt ratings, which reflect the rating agency's assessment of a company's prospects for repaying its debts and are considered by lenders in connection with the
setting of interest rates and terms for a company's short- and long-term borrowings. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold any security, and they may be revised or withdrawn at
any time by the rating agency. Each agency's rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency's rating. The system and the number of rating categories can vary widely from rating agency to
rating agency. Customers usually focus on claims-paying ratings, while creditors focus on debt ratings. Investors use



both
to evaluate a company's overall financial strength. The ratings issued on the Company or its subsidiaries by any of these agencies are announced publicly and are available on the Company's
website and from the agencies.

A
downgrade in one or more of the Company's claims-paying ratings could negatively impact the Company's business volumes and competitive position because demand for certain of its
products may be reduced, particularly because some customers require that the Company maintain minimum ratings to enter into, maintain or renew business with it.

Additionally,
a downgrade in one or more of the Company's debt ratings could adversely impact the Company's ability to access the capital markets and other sources of funds, including in
the syndicated bank loan market, and/or result in higher financing costs. For example, downgrades in the Company's debt ratings could result in higher interest expense under the Company's revolving
credit agreement (under which the cost of borrowing could range from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points to LIBOR plus 150 basis points, depending on the Company's debt ratings), the Company's commercial
paper program, or in the event that the Company were to access the capital markets by issuing debt or similar types of securities. See note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements
for a discussion of the Company's revolving credit agreement and commercial paper program. The Company considers the level of increased cash funding requirements in the event of a ratings downgrade as
part of the evaluation of the Company's liquidity requirements. The Company currently believes that a one- to two-notch
downgrade in its debt ratings would not result in a material increase in interest expense under its existing credit agreement and commercial paper programs. In addition, the Company considers the
impact of a ratings downgrade as part of the evaluation of its common share repurchases.

Rating Agency Actions

The following rating agency actions were taken with respect to the Company from February 16, 2017, the date on which the Company filed
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, through February 15, 2018:

•

On June 19, 2017, Fitch affirmed all ratings of the Company. The outlook for all ratings is stable.

•

On July 13, 2017, Moody's affirmed all ratings of the Company. The outlook for all ratings is stable.

•

On October 5, 2017, A.M. Best affirmed all ratings of the Company, except ratings for Travelers Insurance Company Limited, which
were affirmed on January 12, 2018. The outlook for all ratings is stable. Concurrently with the affirmation of these ratings, A.M. Best withdrew its ratings for The Premier Insurance
Company of Massachusetts at the Company's request.

INVESTMENT OPERATIONS

The majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government,
tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity investments, and the Company's investment
purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy its insurance and debt obligations. Generally, the expected principal and interest payments produced
by the Company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company's insurance reserves. The Company's management of the duration of the fixed maturity investment portfolio,
including its use of Treasury futures at times, has produced a duration that is less than the estimated duration of the Company's net
insurance liabilities. The substantial amount by which the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow from newly
sold policies and the large amount of high-quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.



The Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships
and joint ventures. These investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also involve varying degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.

See
note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Company's investment portfolio.

REGULATION

U.S. State and Federal Regulation

TRV's domestic insurance subsidiaries are collectively licensed to transact insurance business in all U.S. states, the District of Columbia,
Guam, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and are subject to regulation in the various states and jurisdictions in which they transact business. The extent of regulation varies, but generally
derives from statutes that delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative authority to a department of insurance in each state and jurisdiction. The regulation, supervision and administration
relate, among other things, to standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their agents, the nature of and limitations on investments, premium rates,
restrictions on the size of risks that may be insured under a single policy, reserves and provisions for unearned premiums, losses and other obligations, deposits of securities for the benefit of
policyholders, approval of policy forms and the regulation of market conduct, including the use of credit information in underwriting as well as other underwriting and claims practices. State
insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of insurance companies and require the filing of financial and other reports on a quarterly and
annual basis.

State
insurance regulation continues to evolve in response to the changing economic and business environment as well as efforts by regulators internationally to develop a consistent
approach to regulation. While the U.S. federal government has not historically regulated the insurance business, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 established a
Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. While the FIO has limited regulatory authority, it has been active in the discussions to develop international regulatory
standards for the insurance industry. In response to these international efforts, the state insurance regulators, through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), are working with
the Federal Reserve and the FIO to consider and develop changes to the U.S. regulatory framework.

These
changes are evidenced by the incorporation of supervisory colleges into the U.S. regulatory framework. A supervisory college is a forum of the regulators having jurisdictional
authority over a holding company's various insurance subsidiaries, including foreign insurance subsidiaries, convened to meet with the insurer's executive management, to evaluate the insurer from both
a group-wide and legal-entity basis. Some of the items evaluated during the colleges include the insurer's business strategies, enterprise risk management and corporate governance.

While
insurance in the United States is regulated on a legal-entity basis, the NAIC has adopted changes to its Model Holding Company Act that some states, including the State of
Connecticut, have enacted to allow the insurance commissioner to be designated as the group-wide supervisor (i.e., lead regulator) for the insurance holding company system based upon certain
criteria, including the place of domicile of the insurance subsidiaries holding the majority of the insurance group's premiums, assets, or liabilities. Based upon these criteria, the State of
Connecticut Insurance Department is designated as TRV's lead regulator and conducts the supervisory colleges for the Company.

Insurance Regulation Concerning Dividends from Insurance Subsidiaries.

TRV's principal domestic insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in
the State of
Connecticut. The Connecticut insurance holding



company
laws require notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend from an insurance subsidiary that, together with other distributions
made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurance subsidiary's statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurance subsidiary's
net income for the twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration or
payment is further limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices.

The
insurance holding company laws of other states in which TRV's domestic insurance subsidiaries are domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more
restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends.

Rate and Rule Approvals.

TRV's domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to each state's laws and regulations regarding rate and rule
approvals.
The applicable laws and regulations generally establish standards to ensure that rates are not excessive, inadequate, unfairly discriminatory or used to engage in unfair price competition. An
insurer's ability to adjust rates and the relative timing of the process are dependent upon each state's requirements. Many states have enacted variations of competitive ratemaking laws, which allow
insurers to set certain premium rates for certain classes of insurance without having to obtain the prior approval of the state insurance department.

Requirements for Exiting Geographic Markets and/or Canceling or Nonrenewing Policies.

Many states have laws and regulations which may
impact the
timing and/or the ability of an insurer to either discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in that state. These laws and regulations typically require prior notice, and in some instances
insurance department approval, prior to discontinuing a line of business or withdrawing from that state. In addition, all states impose limitations on cancellations or non-renewals of certain
policies, including in particular, limitations on the reasons for cancellations and on the timing of non-renewals.

Assessments for Guaranty Funds and Second-Injury Funds and Other Mandatory Assigned Risk and Reinsurance Arrangements.

Virtually all
states require
insurers licensed to do business in their state, including TRV's domestic insurance subsidiaries, to bear a portion of the loss suffered by some claimants because of the insolvency of other insurers.
Many states also have laws that establish second-injury funds to provide compensation to injured employees for aggravation of a prior condition or injury.

TRV's
domestic insurance subsidiaries are also required to participate in various involuntary assigned risk pools, principally involving workers' compensation, automobile insurance,
property windpools in states prone to property damage from hurricanes and Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) plans, as well as automobile assigned risk plans the results of which are not
pooled with other carriers, which provide various insurance coverages to individuals or other entities that otherwise are unable to purchase that coverage in the voluntary market.

Assessments
may include any charge mandated by statute or regulatory authority that is related directly or indirectly to underwriting activities. Examples of such mechanisms include, but
are not limited to, the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund, Florida Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, National Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Pool, various workers' compensation related
funds (e.g., the Florida Special Disability Trust), North Carolina Beach Plan, Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation, and the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association. Amounts payable
or paid as a result of arrangements that are in substance reinsurance, including certain involuntary pools where insurers are required to assume premiums and losses from those pools, are accounted for
as reinsurance (e.g., National Workers' Compensation Reinsurance Pool, North Carolina Beach Plan). Amounts related to assessments from arrangements that are not reinsurance are reported as a
component of "General and Administrative Expenses," such as the Florida Special Disability Trust. For



additional
information concerning assessments for guaranty funds and second-injury funds and other mandatory assigned risk and reinsurance agreements including state-funding mechanisms, see
"Item 1A—Risk Factors."

Insurance Regulatory Information System.

The NAIC developed the Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) to help state regulators
identify
companies that may require regulatory attention. Financial examiners review annual financial statements and the results of key financial ratios based on year-end data with the goal of identifying
insurers that appear to require immediate regulatory attention. Each ratio has an established "usual range" of results. A ratio result falling outside the usual
range, however, is not necessarily considered adverse; rather, unusual values are used as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. Furthermore, in some years, it may not be unusual for
financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside the usual ranges. Generally, an insurance company may become subject to regulatory scrutiny or, depending on the company's
financial condition, regulatory action if certain of its key IRIS ratios fall outside the usual ranges and the insurer's financial condition is trending downward.

Based
on preliminary 2017 IRIS ratios calculated by the Company for its lead domestic insurance subsidiaries, The Travelers Indemnity Company had results outside the normal range for one
IRIS ratio due to the size of its investments in certain non-fixed maturity securities, while Travelers Casualty and Surety Company had results outside the normal range for one IRIS ratio due to the
amount of dividends received from its subsidiaries. In 2016, The Travelers Indemnity Company and Travelers Casualty and Surety Company had results outside the normal range for these same ratios.
Additionally, St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company had results outside the normal range for one IRIS ratio in 2016 due to the amount of dividends received from its subsidiaries.

Management
does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of the 2017 IRIS ratio results for the lead insurance subsidiaries or their insurance subsidiaries. In all instances in prior
years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required.

Risk-Based Capital (RBC) Requirements.

The NAIC has an RBC requirement which sets forth minimum capital standards for most property and
casualty
insurance companies and is intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. The Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these NAIC RBC requirements based on laws
that have been adopted by individual states. These requirements subject insurers having policyholders' surplus less than that required by the RBC calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action,
depending on the level of capital inadequacy. Each of the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders' surplus at December 31, 2017 significantly above the level at which any RBC
regulatory action would occur.

While
there is currently no group regulatory capital requirement in the United States, a comparison of an insurer's policyholders' surplus on a combined basis to the legal entity NAIC
RBC requirements on a combined basis can provide useful information regarding an insurance group's overall capital adequacy in the U.S. The amount of policyholders' surplus held by the Company's U.S.
insurance subsidiaries at December 31, 2017, determined on a combined basis, significantly exceeded the level at which the subsidiaries would be subject to RBC regulatory action (company action
level) on a combined basis at that date.

The
formulas have not been designed to differentiate among adequately capitalized companies that operate with levels of capital above the RBC requirement. Therefore, it is inappropriate
and ineffective to use the formulas to rate or to rank these companies.

Investment Regulation.

Insurance company investments must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality
and
concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage
loans, real estate and certain other investments,



subject
to specified limits and certain other qualifications. At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with these laws and regulations.

International Regulation

TRV's insurance subsidiaries based in Canada, and the Canadian branch of one of the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries, are regulated for
solvency purposes by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) under the provisions of the Insurance Companies Act (Canada). These Canadian subsidiaries and the Canadian branch
are also subject to Canadian provincial and territorial insurance legislation which regulates market conduct, including pricing, underwriting, coverage and claim conduct, in varying degrees by
province/territory and by product line.

TRV's
insurance subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom are regulated by two regulatory bodies, The Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) and The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The
PRA's primary objective is to promote the safety and soundness of insurers for the protection of policyholders, while the FCA has three operational objectives: (i) to secure an appropriate
degree of protection for consumers, (ii) to protect and enhance the integrity of the U.K. financial system, and (iii) to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.
TRV's insurance operations in the Republic of Ireland are conducted through the Irish branch of Travelers Insurance Company Limited which is supervised by the Insurance Supervision Departments of the
Central Bank of Ireland (as to conduct) and also by the PRA.

TRV's
managing agency (Travelers Syndicate Management Limited) (TSML) of its Lloyd's syndicate (Syndicate 5000) is also regulated by the PRA and the FCA, which have delegated certain
regulatory responsibilities to the Council of Lloyd's. Travelers Syndicate 5000 is able to write business in over 75 jurisdictions throughout the world by virtue of Lloyd's international licenses. In
each such jurisdiction,
the policies written by TSML, as part of Lloyd's, are subject to the laws and insurance regulations of that jurisdiction. Travelers Underwriting Agency Limited, which as an insurance intermediary is
regulated by the FCA, produces insurance business for Travelers Syndicate 5000.

TRV's
operations in the U.K. and the Republic of Ireland are also subject to regulation by the European Union (EU). Generally, EU requirements are adopted by the EU and then implemented
by enabling legislation in the member countries. Significant areas of oversight and influence from the EU include capital and solvency requirements (Solvency II), competition law and antitrust
regulation, intermediary and distribution regulation, gender discrimination and data security and privacy. The applicability to TRV's businesses of all of the EU requirements are likely to change in
ways yet to be determined as a result of the U.K.'s exit from the EU, which is currently expected to be effective in March 2019. The Company announced in December 2017 that it applied to the Central
Bank of Ireland for authorization of a new wholly owned insurance subsidiary to be incorporated in the Republic of Ireland to serve its customers and broking partners in Ireland and across Europe upon
the U.K.'s exit from the EU.

A
TRV subsidiary, Travelers Casualty and Surety Company, has a representative office in China. The representative office is regulated by the China Insurance Regulatory Commission. A TRV
subsidiary, TCI Global Services, Inc., has a liaison office in India. Insurance business in India is regulated by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority. TRV's Brazilian operations
are regulated by the Superintendencia de Seguros Privados (SUSEP).

Regulators
in these jurisdictions require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount of insurance policies in force.
Each of the Company's foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital above their respective regulatory requirements at December 31, 2017.



United States and European Union Covered Agreement

On September 22, 2017, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) signed a
covered agreement (the Covered Agreement) regarding prudential (solvency) insurance and reinsurance measures with the EU. The Covered Agreement includes three areas of prudential insurance supervision
related to: reinsurance contracts,
group supervision, and the exchange of information between U.S. and EU insurers and the respective insurance regulators. The EU is expected to finalize approval of the Covered Agreement in the first
half of 2018.

The
Covered Agreement is intended to promote cooperation between the U.S. and EU insurance regulators, and limits the ability of the EU to apply solvency and group capital requirements
to the worldwide operations of any U.S. insurer operating in the EU. The Covered Agreement eliminates the collateral and local presence requirements for EU reinsurers operating in the U.S. insurance
market, and for U.S. reinsurers operating in the EU, as a condition for credit for reinsurance in regulatory reporting and capital requirements. The prospective elimination of the collateral
requirement is conditioned on the reinsurer meeting capital and solvency standards and maintaining a record of prompt payments to ceding insurers. The Covered Agreement includes a five-year transition
period to full compliance.

Insurance Holding Company Statutes

As a holding company, TRV is not regulated as an insurance company. However, since TRV owns capital stock in insurance subsidiaries, it is
subject to state insurance holding company statutes, as well as certain other laws, of each of its insurance subsidiaries' states of domicile. All holding company statutes, as well as other laws,
require disclosure and, in some instances, prior approval of material transactions between an insurance company and an affiliate. The holding company statutes and other laws also require, among other
things, prior approval of an acquisition of control of a domestic insurer, some transactions between affiliates and the payment of extraordinary dividends or distributions.

Insurance Regulations Concerning Change of Control.

Many state insurance regulatory laws contain provisions that require advance
approval by state
agencies of any change in control of an insurance company that is domiciled, or, in some cases, having substantial business that it is deemed to be commercially domiciled, in that state.

The
laws of many states also contain provisions requiring pre-notification to state agencies prior to any change in control of a non-domestic insurance company admitted to transact
business in that state. While these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, they do authorize issuance of cease-and-desist orders with respect
to the non-domestic insurer if it is determined that some conditions, such as undue market concentration, would result from the acquisition.

Any
transactions that would constitute a change in control of any of TRV's insurance subsidiaries would generally require prior approval by the insurance departments of the states in
which the insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or commercially domiciled. They may also require pre-acquisition notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions
and in which such insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business.

Two
of TRV's insurance subsidiaries and its operations at Lloyd's are domiciled in the United Kingdom. Insurers in the United Kingdom are subject to change of control restrictions,
including approval of the PRA and FCA. TRV's insurance subsidiaries domiciled in, or authorized to conduct insurance business in, Canada are also subject to regulatory change of control restrictions,
including approval of OSFI. TRV's Brazilian operations are subject to regulatory change of control and other share transfer restrictions, including approval of SUSEP.



These
requirements may deter, delay or prevent transactions affecting the control of or the ownership of common stock, including transactions that could be advantageous to TRV's
shareholders.

Regulatory Developments

For a discussion of domestic and international regulatory developments, see "Item 1A—Risk Factors" including "Changes in
federal regulation could impose significant burdens on us and otherwise adversely impact our results" and "Regulatory changes outside of the United States, including in Canada, the U.K. and the
European Union, could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our growth."

ENTERPRISE RISK MANAGEMENT

As a large property and casualty insurance enterprise, the Company is exposed to many risks. These risks are a function of the environments
within which the Company operates. Since certain risks can be correlated with other risks, an event or a series of events can impact multiple areas of the Company simultaneously and have a material
effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity. These exposures require an entity-wide view of risk and an understanding of the potential impact on all aspects of
the Company's operations. It also requires the Company to manage its risk-taking to be within its risk appetite in a prudent and balanced effort to create and preserve value for all of the Company's
stakeholders. This approach to Company-wide risk evaluation and management is commonly called Enterprise Risk Management (ERM). ERM activities involve both the identification and assessment of a broad
range of risks and the execution of synchronized strategies to effectively manage such risks. Effective ERM also includes the determination of the Company's risk capital needs, which takes into
account regulatory requirements and credit rating considerations, in addition to economic and other factors.

ERM
at the Company is an integral part of its business operations. All corporate leaders and the Board of Directors are engaged in ERM. ERM involves risk-based analytics, as well as
reporting and feedback throughout the enterprise in support of the Company's long-term financial strategies and objectives.

The
Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to make underwriting and reinsurance decisions designed to manage its
exposure to catastrophic events. In addition to catastrophe modeling and analysis, the Company also models and analyzes its exposure to other extreme events. The Company also utilizes proprietary and
third-party computer modeling processes to evaluate capital adequacy. These analytical techniques are an integral component of the Company's ERM process and further support the Company's long-term
financial strategies and objectives.

In
addition to the day-to-day ERM activities within the Company's operations, key internal risk management functions include, among others, the Management and Operating Committees
(comprised of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and the other most senior members of management), the Enterprise and Business Risk Committees of management, the Credit Committee, Chief Legal
Officer, General Counsel, the Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, the Corporate Actuarial group, the Corporate Audit group, the Corporate Controller group, the Accounting Policy group and the
Enterprise Underwriting group, among others. A senior executive team comprised of the Chief Risk Officer and the Chief Underwriting Officer oversees the ERM process. The mission of this team is to
facilitate risk assessment and to collaborate in implementing effective risk management strategies throughout the Company. Another strategic ERM objective of this team includes working across the
Company to enhance effective and realistic risk modeling capabilities as part of the Company's overall
effort to understand and manage its portfolio of risks to be within its risk appetite. Board oversight of ERM is provided by the Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, which reviews the strategies,



processes
and controls pertaining to the Company's insurance operations and oversees the implementation, execution and performance of the Company's ERM program. The Risk Committee of the Board of
Directors meets with senior management at least four times a year to discuss ERM activities and provides a report to the full Board of Directors after each such meeting.

The
Company's ERM efforts build upon the foundation of an effective internal control environment. ERM expands the internal control objectives of effective and efficient operations,
reliable financial reporting and compliance with applicable laws and regulations, to fostering, leading and supporting an integrated, risk-based culture within the Company that focuses on value
creation and preservation. However, the Company can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that these objectives will be met. Further, the design of any risk management or control system
must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. As a result, the possibility of material financial loss remains in spite of the
Company's significant ERM efforts. An investor should carefully consider the risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report, including the discussions included in
"Item 1A—Risk Factors," "Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk," and "Item 8—Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data."

Glossary of Selected Insurance Terms

Accident year

The annual calendar accounting period in which loss events occurred, regardless of when the losses are actually reported, booked or paid.

Adjusted unassigned surplus

Unassigned surplus as of the most recent statutory annual report reduced by twenty-five percent of that year's unrealized
appreciation in value or revaluation of assets or unrealized profits on investments, as defined in that report.

Admitted insurer

A company licensed to transact insurance business within a state.

Agent

A licensed individual who sells and services insurance policies, receiving a commission from the insurer for selling the
business and a fee for servicing it. An independent agent represents multiple insurance companies and searches the market for the best product for its client.

Annuity

A contract that pays a periodic benefit over the remaining life of a person (the annuitant), the lives of two or more
persons or for a specified period of time.



Assigned risk pools

Reinsurance pools which cover risks for those unable to purchase insurance in the voluntary market. Possible reasons for this inability
include the risk being too great or the profit being too small under the required insurance rate structure. The costs of the risks associated with these pools are charged back to insurance carriers in proportion to their direct writings.

Assumed reinsurance

Insurance risks acquired from a ceding company.

Book value per share

Total common shareholders' equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding.

Broker

One who negotiates contracts of insurance or reinsurance on behalf of an insured party, receiving a commission from the
insurer or reinsurer for placement and other services rendered.

Capacity

The percentage of statutory capital and surplus, or the dollar amount of exposure, that an insurer or reinsurer is willing
or able to place at risk. Capacity may apply to a single risk, a program, a line of business or an entire book of business. Capacity may be constrained by legal restrictions, corporate restrictions or indirect restrictions.

Captive

A closely-held insurance company whose primary purpose is to provide insurance coverage to the company's owners or their
affiliates.

Case reserves

Claim department estimates of anticipated future payments to be made on each specific individual reported
claim.

Casualty insurance

Insurance which is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons, i.e., not the insured, and
the legal liability imposed on the insured resulting therefrom. It includes, but is not limited to, employers' liability, workers' compensation, public liability, automobile liability, personal liability and aviation liability insurance. It excludes
certain types of losses that by law or custom are considered as being exclusively within the scope of other types of insurance, such as fire or marine.

Catastrophe

A severe loss designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses
resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms,
earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive
acts including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount.
Their effects are included in net and core income and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence. A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.



The Company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment
or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate
threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2017 ranged from approximately $17 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.

Catastrophe loss

Loss and directly identified loss adjustment expenses from catastrophes, as well as related reinsurance reinstatement
premiums and assessments from various pools.

Catastrophe reinsurance

A form of excess-of-loss reinsurance which, subject to a specified limit, indemnifies the ceding company for the amount of
loss in excess of a specified retention with respect to an accumulation of losses and related reinsurance reinstatement premiums resulting from a catastrophic event. The actual reinsurance document is called a "catastrophe cover." These reinsurance
contracts are typically designed to cover property insurance losses but can be written to cover casualty insurance losses such as from workers' compensation policies.

Cede; ceding company

When an insurer reinsures its liability with another insurer or a "cession," it "cedes" business and is referred to as the
"ceding company."

Ceded reinsurance

Insurance risks transferred to another company as reinsurance. See "Reinsurance."

Claim

Request by an insured for indemnification by an insurance company for loss incurred from an insured peril.

Claim adjustment expenses

See "Loss adjustment expenses (LAE)."

Claims and claim adjustment expenses

See "Loss" and "Loss adjustment expenses (LAE)."

Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves

See "Loss reserves."

Cohort

A group of items or individuals that share a particular statistical or demographic characteristic. For example, all claims
for a given product in a given market for a given accident year would represent a cohort of claims.

Combined ratio

For Statutory Accounting Practices (SAP), the combined ratio is the sum of the SAP loss and LAE ratio and the SAP
underwriting expense ratio as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The combined ratio as used in this report is the equivalent of, and is calculated in the same manner as, the SAP combined ratio except that
the SAP underwriting expense ratio is based on net

written

premium and the underwriting expense ratio as used in this report is based on net

earned

premiums.



The combined ratio is an indicator of the Company's underwriting discipline, efficiency in acquiring and servicing its business and overall
underwriting profitability. A combined ratio under 100% generally indicates an underwriting profit. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates an underwriting loss.

Other companies' method of computing a similarly titled measure may not be comparable to the Company's method of computing
this ratio.

Commercial multi-peril policies

Refers to policies which cover both property and third-party liability exposures.

Commutation agreement

An agreement between a reinsurer and a ceding company whereby the reinsurer pays an agreed-upon amount in exchange for a
complete discharge of all obligations, including future obligations, between the parties for reinsurance losses incurred.

Core income (loss)

Consolidated net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses), discontinued
operations, the effect of a change in tax laws and tax rates at enactment date, and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles when applicable. Financial statement users consider core income when analyzing the results and trends of
insurance companies.

Debt-to-total capital ratio

The ratio of debt to total capitalization.

Debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain (loss) on investments

The ratio of debt to total capitalization excluding the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains and losses
included in shareholders' equity.

Deductible

The amount of loss that an insured retains.

Deferred acquisition costs (DAC)

Incremental direct costs of acquired and renewal insurance contracts, consisting of commissions (other than contingent
commissions) and premium-related taxes that are deferred and amortized to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses when reported in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

Deficiency

With regard to reserves for a given liability, a deficiency exists when it is estimated or determined that the reserves are
insufficient to pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. Where the deficiency is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of deficiency (or even the finding of whether or not a deficiency exists) may change as new
information becomes available.

Demand surge

Significant short-term increases in building material and labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials
and services, commonly as a result of a large catastrophe resulting in significant widespread property damage.



Direct written premiums

The amounts charged by an insurer to insureds in exchange for coverages provided in accordance with the terms of an insurance contract. The
amounts exclude the impact of all reinsurance premiums, either assumed or ceded.

Earned premiums or premiums earned

That portion of property casualty premiums written that applies to the expired portion of the policy term. Earned premiums
are recognized as revenues under both SAP and GAAP.

Excess and surplus lines insurance

Insurance for risks not covered by standard insurance due to the unique nature of the risk. Risks could be placed in excess
and surplus lines markets due to any number of characteristics, such as loss experience, unique or unusual exposures, or insufficient experience in business. Excess and surplus lines are less regulated by the states, allowing greater flexibility to
design specific insurance coverage and negotiate pricing based on the risks to be secured.

Excess liability

Additional casualty coverage above a layer of insurance exposures.

Excess-of-loss reinsurance

Reinsurance that indemnifies the reinsured against all or a specified portion of losses over a specified dollar amount or
"retention."

Exposure

The measure of risk used in the pricing of an insurance product. The change in exposure is the amount of change in premium
on policies that renew attributable to the change in portfolio risk.

Facultative reinsurance

The reinsurance of all or a portion of the insurance provided by a single policy. Each policy reinsured is separately
negotiated.

Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan

A residual market mechanism which provides property insurance to those unable to obtain such insurance through the regular
(voluntary) market. FAIR plans are set up on a state-by-state basis to cover only those risks in that state. For more information, see "residual market (involuntary business)."

Fidelity and surety programs

Fidelity insurance coverage protects an insured for loss due to embezzlement or misappropriation of funds by an employee.
Surety is a three-party agreement in which the insurer agrees to pay a third party or complete an obligation in response to the default, acts or omissions of an insured.

Gross written premiums

The direct and assumed contractually determined amounts charged to the policyholders for the effective period of the
contract based on the terms and conditions of the insurance contract.

Ground-up analysis

A method to estimate ultimate claim costs for a given cohort of claims such as an accident year/product line component. It
involves analyzing the exposure and claim activity at an individual insured level and then through the use of deterministic or stochastic scenarios and/or simulations, estimating the ultimate losses for those insureds. The total losses for the cohort
are then the sum of the losses for each individual insured.



In practice, the method is sometimes simplified by performing the individual insured analysis only for the larger insureds, with the costs
for the smaller insureds estimated via sampling approaches (extrapolated to the rest of the smaller insured population) or aggregate approaches (using assumptions consistent with the ground-up larger insured analysis).

Guaranteed-cost products

An insurance policy where the premiums charged will not be adjusted for actual loss experience during the covered
period.

Guaranty fund

A state-regulated mechanism that is financed by assessing insurers doing business in those states. Should insolvencies
occur, these funds are available to meet some or all of the insolvent insurer's obligations to policyholders.

Holding company liquidity

Total cash, short-term invested assets and other readily marketable securities held by the holding company.

Incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves

Reserves for estimated losses and LAE that have been incurred but not yet reported to the insurer. This includes amounts
for unreported claims, development on known cases, and re-opened claims.

Inland marine

A broad type of insurance generally covering articles that may be transported from one place to another, as well as bridges,
 tunnels and other instrumentalities of transportation. It includes goods in transit, generally other than transoceanic, and may include policies for movable objects such as personal effects, personal property, jewelry, furs, fine art and
others.

IRIS ratios

Financial ratios calculated by the NAIC to assist state insurance departments in monitoring the financial condition of
insurance companies.

Large deductible policy

An insurance policy where the customer assumes at least $25,000 or more of each loss. Typically, the insurer is responsible
for paying the entire loss under those policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount.

Lloyd's

An insurance marketplace based in London, England, where brokers, representing clients with insurable risks, deal with
Lloyd's underwriters, who represent investors. The investors are grouped together into syndicates that provide capital to insure the risks.

Loss

An occurrence that is the basis for submission and/or payment of a claim. Losses may be covered, limited or excluded from
coverage, depending on the terms of the policy.

Loss adjustment expenses (LAE)

The expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and the portion of general expenses allocated to claim
settlement costs.



Loss and LAE ratio

For SAP, the loss and LAE ratio is the ratio of incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses less certain administrative services fee
income to net earned premiums as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The loss and LAE ratio as used in this report is calculated in the same manner as the SAP ratio.

The loss and LAE ratio is an indicator of the Company's underwriting discipline and underwriting profitability.

Other companies' method of computing a similarly titled measure may not be comparable to the Company's method of computing
this ratio.

Loss reserves

Liabilities established by insurers and reinsurers to reflect the estimated cost of claims incurred that the insurer or
reinsurer will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance or reinsurance it has written. Reserves are established for losses and for LAE, and consist of case reserves and IBNR reserves. As the term is used in this document, "loss reserves"
is meant to include reserves for both losses and LAE.

Loss reserve development

The increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims. Loss reserve development may be related to prior year or current year development.

Losses incurred

The total losses sustained by an insurance company under a policy or policies, whether paid or unpaid. Incurred losses
include a provision for IBNR.

Reinsurance wherein the insurer cedes an agreed-upon fixed percentage of liabilities, premiums and losses for each policy
covered on a pro rata basis.

Rates

Amounts charged per unit of insurance.

Redundancy

With regard to reserves for a given liability, a redundancy exists when it is estimated or determined that the reserves are
greater than what will be needed to pay the ultimate settlement value of the related liabilities. Where the redundancy is the result of an estimate, the estimated amount of redundancy (or even the finding of whether or not a redundancy exists) may
change as new information becomes available.

Reinstatement premiums

Additional premiums payable to reinsurers to restore coverage limits that have been exhausted as a result of reinsured
losses under certain excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties.

Reinsurance

subject to change based on a number of factors, including changes in estimates.

Renewal rate change

The estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, excluding exposure changes. Such statistics are subject to
change based on a number of factors, including changes in estimates.

Residual market (involuntary business)

Insurance market which provides coverage for risks for those unable to purchase insurance in the voluntary market. Possible
reasons for this inability include the risks being too great or the profit potential too small under the required insurance rate structure. Residual markets are frequently created by state legislation either because of lack of available coverage such
as: property coverage in a windstorm prone area or protection of the accident victim as in the case of workers' compensation. The costs of the residual market are usually charged back to the direct insurance carriers in proportion to the carriers'
voluntary market shares for the type of coverage involved.

Second-injury fund

The employer of an injured, impaired worker is responsible only for the workers' compensation benefit for the most recent
injury; the second-injury fund would cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a prior condition. The cost is shared by the insurance industry and self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds
based on either premiums or losses.

Segment income (loss)

Determined in the same manner as core income (loss) on a segment basis. Management uses segment income (loss) to analyze

surplus."

Statutory net income

As determined under SAP, total revenues less total expenses and income taxes.

Structured settlements

Periodic payments to an injured person or survivor for a determined number of years or for life, typically in settlement of
a claim under a liability policy, usually funded through the purchase of an annuity.

Subrogation

A principle of law incorporated in insurance policies, which enables an insurance company, after paying a claim under a
policy, to recover the amount of the loss from another person or entity who is legally liable for it.

Tenure impact

As new business volume increases and accounts for a greater percentage of earned premiums, the loss and LAE ratio generally
worsens initially, as the loss and LAE ratio for new business is generally higher than the ratio for business that has been retained for longer periods. As poorer performing business leaves and pricing segmentation improves on renewal of the business
that is retained, the loss and LAE ratio is expected to improve in future years.

Third-party liability

A liability owed to a claimant (third party) who is not one of the two parties to the insurance contract. Insured liability
claims are referred to as third-party claims.

Total capitalization

The sum of total shareholders' equity and debt.

Treaty reinsurance

The reinsurance of a specified type or category of risks defined in a reinsurance agreement (a "treaty") between a primary
insurer or other reinsured and a reinsurer. Typically, in treaty reinsurance, the primary insurer or reinsured is obligated to offer and the reinsurer is obligated to accept a specified portion of all that type or category of risks originally written
by the primary insurer or reinsured.

Umbrella coverage

A form of insurance protection against losses in excess of amounts covered by other liability insurance policies or amounts
not covered by the usual liability policies.

Unassigned surplus

The undistributed and unappropriated amount of statutory capital and surplus.



Underlying combined ratio

The underlying combined ratio is the sum of the underlying loss and LAE ratio and the underlying underwriting expense ratio. The underlying
combined ratio is an indicator of the Company's underwriting discipline and underwriting profitability for the current accident year.

Underlying loss and LAE ratio

The underlying loss and LAE ratio is the loss and LAE ratio, adjusted to exclude the impact of catastrophes and prior year
reserve development. The underlying loss and LAE ratio is an indicator of the Company's underwriting discipline and underwriting profitability for the current accident year.

Underlying underwriting expense ratio

The underlying underwriting expense ratio is the underwriting expense ratio adjusted to exclude the impact of
catastrophes.

Underlying underwriting margin

Net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses (excluding catastrophe losses and prior year
reserve development) and insurance-related expenses.

Underwriter

An employee of an insurance company who examines, accepts or rejects risks and classifies accepted risks in order to charge
an appropriate premium for each accepted risk. The underwriter is expected to select business that will produce an average risk of loss no greater than that anticipated for the class of business.

Underwriting

The insurer's or reinsurer's process of reviewing applications for insurance coverage, and the decision as to whether to
accept all or part of the coverage and determination of the applicable premiums; also refers to the acceptance of that coverage.

Underwriting expense ratio

For SAP, the underwriting expense ratio is the ratio of underwriting expenses incurred (including commissions paid), less
certain administrative services fee income and billing and policy fees, to net

written

premiums as defined in the statutory financial statements required by insurance regulators. The underwriting expense
ratio as used in this report is the ratio of underwriting expenses (including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs), less certain administrative services fee income, billing and policy fees and other, to net

earned

premiums.

The underwriting expense ratio is an indicator of the Company's efficiency in acquiring and servicing its
business.

Other companies' method of computing a similarly titled measure may not be comparable to the Company's method of computing
this ratio.

Underwriting gain or loss

Net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses.

Unearned premium

The portion of premiums written that is allocable to the unexpired portion of the policy term.

Voluntary market

The market in which a person seeking insurance obtains coverage without the assistance of residual market
mechanisms.



Wholesale broker

An independent or exclusive agent that represents both admitted and non-admitted insurers in market areas, which include standard,
non-standard, specialty and excess and surplus lines of insurance. The wholesaler does not deal directly with the insurance consumer. The wholesaler deals with the retail agent or broker.

Workers' compensation

A system (established under state and federal laws) under which employers provide insurance for benefit payments to their
employees for work-related injuries, deaths and diseases, regardless of fault.

Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this report, including without limitation our
consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical
Accounting Estimates."

Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to
raise
capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance.

Our property and casualty insurance operations expose us to claims arising out of catastrophes. Catastrophes
can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions
and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts including those involving nuclear,
biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure. The geographic distribution of our business subjects us to catastrophe exposures in the United
States and Canada, which include, but are not limited to: hurricanes from Maine through Texas; tornadoes and hail storms throughout the Central, Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United
States; earthquakes in California, the New Madrid region and the Pacific Northwest region of North America; wildfires, particularly in western states and Canada; and terrorism in major cities in the
United States. In addition to our operations in the United States and Canada, our international operations subject us to catastrophe exposures in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and Brazil
as well as to a variety of worldwide catastrophe exposures through our Lloyd's operations.

The
incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable, and it is possible that both the frequency and severity of natural and man-made catastrophic events could
increase. Severe weather events over the last two decades have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends, and potentially changing climate conditions could add to the frequency and
severity of natural disasters and create additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures. For example, over the last two decades, hurricane activity has impacted areas further inland than
previously experienced by us, and demographic changes have resulted in larger populations in coastal areas which historically have been subject to severe storms and related storm surge, thus expanding
our potential for losses from hurricanes. Demographic changes in areas prone to wildfires have also expanded our potential for losses from wildfires. Additionally, both the frequency and severity of
tornado and hail storms in the United States have been more volatile during the last decade. Moreover, we could experience more than one severe catastrophic event in any given period.



All of the catastrophe modeling tools that we use, or that we rely on from outside parties, to evaluate certain of our catastrophe exposures are based on
assumptions and judgments that are subject to error and mis-estimation and may produce estimates that are materially different than actual results. In addition, compared to models for hurricanes,
models for earthquakes are less reliable due to there being a more limited number of significant historical events to analyze, while models for tornadoes and hail storms are newer and may be even less
reliable due to the highly random geographic nature and size of these events. As a result, models for earthquakes and tornado and hail storms may have even greater difficulty predicting risks and
estimating losses. Further, changes in climate conditions could cause our underlying modeling data to be less predictive, thus limiting our ability to effectively evaluate and manage catastrophe risk.
As compared to natural catastrophes, modeling for man-made catastrophes, such as terrorism and cyber events, is even more difficult and less reliable, and for some events (both natural and man-made),
currently there are no reliable modeling techniques. See "We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results" below as well as
"Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Catastrophe Modeling" and "—Changing Climate Conditions."

The
extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of the total amount of insured exposure affected by the event, the severity of the event and the coverage provided, which can be
both property and
casualty coverages. Increases in the value and geographic concentration of insured property, the number of policyholders exposed to certain events and the effects of inflation could increase the
severity of claims from catastrophic events in the future. For example, the specific geographic location impacted by tornadoes is inherently random and unpredictable and the specific location impacted
by a tornado may or may not be highly populated and may or may not have a high concentration of our insured exposures. Similarly, the potential for losses from a cyber event can be larger to the
extent that the event impacts platforms, systems or vulnerabilities shared by a large number of policyholders.

States
have from time to time passed legislation, and regulators have taken action, that have the effect of limiting the ability of insurers to manage catastrophe risk, such as
legislation prohibiting insurers from reducing exposures or withdrawing from catastrophe-prone areas or mandating that insurers participate in residual markets. Participation in residual market
mechanisms has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant losses or assessments to insurers, including us, and, in certain states, those losses or assessments may not be commensurate with
our direct catastrophe exposure in those states. If our competitors leave those states having residual market mechanisms, remaining insurers, including us, may be subject to significant increases in
losses or assessments following a catastrophe. In addition, following catastrophes, there are sometimes legislative and administrative initiatives and court decisions that seek to expand insurance
coverage for catastrophe claims beyond the original intent of the policies or seek to prevent the application of deductibles. Also, our ability to adjust terms, including deductible levels, or to
increase pricing to the extent necessary to offset rising costs of catastrophes, particularly in the Personal Insurance segment, requires approval of regulatory authorities of certain states. Our
ability or our willingness to manage our catastrophe exposure by raising prices, modifying underwriting terms or reducing exposure to certain geographies may be limited due to considerations of public
policy, the evolving political environment and/or changes in the general economic climate. We also may choose to write business in catastrophe-prone areas that we might not otherwise write for
strategic purposes, such as improving our access to other underwriting opportunities.

There
are also factors that impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves related to hurricanes
can be affected by the inability to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the limited availability of the necessary labor and supplies, the legal
and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information available to establish the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining
whether damage was caused by



flooding
versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold
damage; business interruption costs; late reported claims; litigation; and reinsurance collectability. The timing of a catastrophe's occurrence, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can
also affect the information available to us in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted in subsequent
periods as actual claims emerge and additional information becomes available.

Exposure
to catastrophe losses or actual losses resulting from a catastrophe could adversely affect our financial strength and claims-paying ratings and could impair our ability to raise
capital on acceptable terms or at all. Also, as a result of our exposure to catastrophe losses or actual losses following a catastrophe, rating agencies may further increase capital requirements,
which may require us to raise capital to maintain our ratings. A ratings downgrade could hurt our ability to compete effectively or attract new business. In addition, catastrophic events could cause
us to exhaust our available reinsurance limits and could adversely impact the cost and availability of reinsurance. Such events can also impact the credit of our reinsurers. For a discussion of our
catastrophe reinsurance coverage, see "Item 1—Business—Reinsurance—Catastrophe Reinsurance." Catastrophic events could also adversely impact the credit of
the issuers of securities, such as states or municipalities, in which we have invested.

In
addition, coverage in our reinsurance program for terrorism is limited. Although the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program provides benefits in the event of certain acts of terrorism,
those benefits are subject to a deductible and other limitations and the program is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2020. Under current provisions of this program, once our losses exceed
20% of our commercial property and casualty insurance premium for the preceding calendar year, the federal government will reimburse us for 82% of our losses attributable to certain acts of terrorism
which exceed this deductible up to a total industry program cap of $100 billion. Our estimated deductible under the program is $2.46 billion for 2018. Over the remaining three-year life
of the reauthorized program, the federal government reimbursement percentage will fall from 82% to 80%. In addition, because the interpretation of this law is untested, there is substantial
uncertainty as to how it will be applied to specific circumstances. For example, application of the law to a specific event will depend upon whether the government has designated such event as a
covered event. It is also possible that future legislation could change or eliminate the program, which could adversely affect our business by increasing our exposure to terrorism losses, or by
lowering our business volume through efforts to avoid that exposure. For a further description of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program, see note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial
statements.

Because
of the risks set forth above, catastrophes such as those caused by various natural or man-made events, such as a terrorist attack or other intentionally destructive acts,
including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events or cyber events, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.
Further, we may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising from a high frequency of high-severity natural catastrophes and/or of man-made catastrophic events involving conventional
means. In addition, while we seek to manage our exposure to man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means, we may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or
more man-made catastrophic events involving "unconventional" means, such as nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological events.

If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary,
including as
a result of, among other things, changes in the legal, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely
affected.

Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but instead represent



management
estimates of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost, generally utilizing actuarial expertise and projection techniques, at a given accounting date.

The
process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both
internal and external events, such as: changes in claims handling procedures; adverse changes in loss cost trends, including inflationary pressures and technology changes which may impact medical,
auto and home repair costs; economic conditions including general and wage inflation; legal trends and legislative changes; and varying judgments and viewpoints of the individuals involved in the
estimation process, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Claims and claim adjustment expense reserve
estimation difficulties also differ significantly by product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of
occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer).

It
is possible that, among other things, past or future steps taken by the federal government and the Federal Reserve to stimulate the U.S. economy, including actions to manage interest
rates, tax reform and changes in international trade regulation, could lead to higher inflation than we had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase in our loss costs. The impact of
inflation on loss costs could be more pronounced for those lines of business that are considered "long tail," such as general liability, as they require a relatively long period of time to finalize
and settle claims for a given accident year. In addition, a significant portion of claims costs, including those in "long tail" lines of business, consists of medical costs. Changes in healthcare
legislation could significantly impact the availability, cost and allocation of payments for medical services, and it is possible that, as a result, inflationary pressures in medical costs may
increase or claim frequency and/or severity may otherwise be adversely impacted. The estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may also be more difficult during times of adverse or
uncertain economic conditions due to unexpected changes in behavior of claimants and policyholders, including an increase in fraudulent reporting of exposures and/or losses, reduced maintenance of
insured properties, increased frequency of small claims or delays in the reporting of claims. In addition, the estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves may be influenced by other
external factors, including continued intensive advertising by plaintiff attorneys.

We
continually refine our claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates in a regular, ongoing process as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and
settled, and the legal, regulatory and economic environment evolves. Business judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual experiences and expertise to
multiple sets of data and analyses. Different experts may choose different assumptions when faced with material uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional experiences and areas
of focus. Hence, such experts may at times produce estimates materially different from each other. This risk may be exacerbated in the context of an acquisition. Experts providing input to the various
estimates and underlying
assumptions include actuaries, underwriters, claim personnel and lawyers, as well as other members of management. Therefore, management may have to consider varying individual viewpoints as part of
its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

We
attempt to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are established or reviewed. Due to the inherent uncertainty
underlying claims and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates, the final resolution of the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses will likely be higher or lower than the
related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses in the future may yield a materially different amount than is currently reserved.



Because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities resulting from one insured event, or an accumulation of insured events, may exceed the current related reserves. In
addition, our estimate of claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, could vary significantly from period to period,
cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and/or our financial position.

For
a discussion of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves by product line, including examples of common factors that can affect required reserves, see
"Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Estimates—Claims and Claim Adjustment
Expense Reserves."

During or following a period of financial market disruption or an economic downturn, our business could be materially and adversely
affected.

Worldwide financial markets and economic conditions have, from time to time, experienced significant disruption or deterioration and likely will
experience periods of disruption or deterioration in the future. If financial markets experience significant disruption or if economic conditions deteriorate, our results of operations, financial
position and/or liquidity likely would be adversely impacted. For example, financial market disruptions and economic downturns in the past have resulted in, among other things, reduced business
volume, as well as heightened credit risk and reduced valuations for certain of our investments. An inflationary environment, as a result of government efforts to stabilize the economy after a
disruption or otherwise, may also, as we discuss in risk factors above, adversely impact our loss costs and the valuation of our investment portfolio.

Financial
market disruption or an economic downturn could be exacerbated by actual or potential economic and geopolitical instability in many regions of the world. This can impact our
business even if we do not conduct business in the region subject to the instability. For example, due to globalization, instability in one region can spread to other regions where we do business. The
United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could have a negative impact on economic conditions in the United Kingdom and could result in unintended consequences in other countries as well. In
the United States, actions or inactions of the United States government may also impact economic conditions. For example, the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 as well as actions that may
be taken by the U.S. administration to address the U.S. Federal budget, the national debt, international trade, the Affordable Care Act and regulation generally, among other things, may contribute,
positively or negatively, to economic conditions generally and create economic and fiscal uncertainty.

Several
of the risk factors discussed above and below identify risks that could result from, or be exacerbated by, financial market disruption, an economic slowdown or economic
uncertainty. These include risks discussed above related to our estimates of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, and those discussed below related to our investment portfolio, the
competitive environment, emerging claim and coverage issues, reinsurance arrangements, other credit exposures, regulatory developments and the impact of rating agency actions. You should also refer to
"Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," particularly the "Outlook" section, for additional information about these risks and
the potential impact on our business.

Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized
losses.

Investment returns are an important part of our overall profitability. Fixed maturity and short-term investments comprised approximately 93% of the
carrying value of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017. Changes in interest rates caused by inflation or other factors (inclusive of credit spreads) affect the carrying value of our
fixed maturity investments and returns on our fixed maturity and short-term investments. A decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on short-term investments and new fixed maturity
investments (including those purchased to re-invest maturities from the existing portfolio), thereby negatively impacting our



net
investment income, while rising interest rates reduce the market value of existing fixed maturity investments, thereby negatively impacting our book value. During 2017, the net pre-tax unrealized
gain in our fixed income portfolio increased from $865 million to $1.38 billion as interest rates decreased. Any future increases in interest rates (inclusive of credit spreads) would
result in a decline in that unrealized gain position or in an unrealized loss, thereby adversely impacting our book value. Interest rates in recent years have been and remain at very low levels
relative to historical experience, and it is possible that rates may remain at low levels for a prolonged period. The value of our fixed maturity and short-term investments is also subject to the risk
that certain investments may default or become impaired due to a deterioration in the financial condition of one or more issuers of the securities held in our portfolio, or due to a deterioration in
the financial condition of an insurer that guarantees an
issuer's payments of such investments. Such defaults and impairments could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. During an economic downturn, fixed maturity and
short-term investments could be subject to a higher risk of default. Rapid changes in commodity prices, such as a significant decline in oil prices, could also subject certain of our investments to a
higher risk of default.

Our
fixed maturity investment portfolio is invested, in substantial part, in obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal
bond portfolio). Notwithstanding the relatively low historical rates of default on many of these obligations and notwithstanding that we typically seek to invest in high-credit-quality securities
(including those with structural protections such as being secured by dedicated or pledged sources of revenue), our municipal bond portfolio could be subject to default or impairment. In
particular:

•

In recent years, many state and local governments have been operating under deficits or projected deficits. The severity and duration of these
deficits could have an adverse impact on the collectability and valuation of our municipal bond portfolio. These deficits may be exacerbated by the impact of unfunded pension plan obligations and
other postretirement obligations or by declining municipal tax bases and revenues in times of financial stress. The recent tax reform also could lead state and local governments to decrease taxes,
which could result in a deterioration of the credit quality of these state and local governments.

•

Some municipal bond issuers may be unwilling to increase tax rates, particularly in light of the recent tax reform, or to reduce spending, to
fund interest or principal payments on their municipal bonds, or may be unable to access the municipal bond market to fund such payments. The risk of widespread defaults may increase if some issuers
voluntarily choose to default, instead of implementing difficult fiscal measures, and the actual or perceived consequences (such as reduced access to capital markets) are less severe than expected.

•

The risk of widespread defaults may also increase if there are changes in legislation that permit states, municipalities and political
subdivisions to file for bankruptcy protection where they were not permitted before. In addition, the collectability and valuation of municipal bonds may be adversely affected if there are judicial
interpretations in a bankruptcy or other proceeding that lessen the value of structural protections. For example, debtors may challenge the effectiveness of structural protections thought to be
provided by municipal securities backed by a dedicated source of revenue. The collectability and valuation may also be adversely affected if there are judicial interpretations in a bankruptcy or other
proceeding that question the payment priority of municipal bonds.

Approximately
30% of the fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years (this includes the early redemption of bonds, assuming interest rates (including credit
spreads) do not rise significantly by applicable call dates). For a schedule of the contractual maturities of our fixed maturity portfolio by year for the next several years, see
"Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Investment Portfolio." As a result, even if



our
investment strategy does not significantly change over the next few years, the overall yield on and composition of our portfolio could be meaningfully impacted by the types of investments
available for reinvestment with the proceeds of matured bonds. For example, if yields decrease when we reinvest such proceeds, our future net investment income would be adversely affected. In
addition, depending on the specific bonds available for purchase at the time of re-investment, the mix of specific issuers in our fixed-income and municipal bond portfolio will change.

Our
portfolio has benefited from tax exemptions (such as those related to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing
dividends-received deductions and tax credits. Changes in these laws could adversely impact the value of our investment portfolio. See "Changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other
jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact us" below.

Our
investment portfolio includes: residential mortgage-backed securities; collateralized mortgage obligations; pass-through securities and asset-backed securities collateralized by
sub-prime mortgages; commercial mortgage-backed securities; and wholly-owned real estate and real estate partnerships, all of which could be adversely impacted by declines in real estate valuations
and/or financial market disruption.

We
also invest a portion of our assets in equity securities, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. From time to time, we may also invest in other
types of non-fixed maturity investments, including investments with exposure to commodity price risk, such as oil. All of these asset classes are subject to greater volatility in their investment
returns than fixed maturity investments. General economic conditions, changes in applicable tax laws and many other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our non-fixed maturity
investments and the realization of net investment income, and/or result in realized investment losses. As a result of these factors, we may realize reduced returns on these investments, incur losses
on sales of these investments and be required to write down the value of these investments, which could reduce our net investment income and result in realized investment losses. From time to time,
the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio, which can result in realized investment losses.

Our
investment portfolio is also subject to increased valuation uncertainties when investment markets are illiquid. The valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are
illiquid, thereby increasing the risk that the estimated fair value (i.e., the carrying amount) of the portion of the investment portfolio that is carried at fair value as reflected in our
financial statements is not reflective of prices at which actual transactions could occur.

We
may, depending on circumstances in the future, including as a result of changes in economic and market conditions, or potential consequences of the recent tax reforms, make changes to
the mix of investments in our investment portfolio as part of our ongoing efforts to seek appropriate risk-adjusted returns. These changes may impact the duration, volatility and risk of our
investment portfolio.

Because
of the risks set forth above, the value of our investment portfolio could decrease, we could experience reduced net investment income and we could experience realized and/or
unrealized investment losses, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and/or liquidity.

Our business could be harmed because of our potential exposure to asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation.

With regard
to asbestos
claims, we have received and continue to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from policyholders (including others seeking coverage under a policy). Factors underlying these claim filings
include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants and the continued focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not



traditionally
primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in
previous years. The bankruptcy of many traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system.
Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those
who have not shown any credible disease manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. This trend of prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries,
along with the focus on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, has contributed to the claims and claim adjustment expense payments we experienced.

We
also continue to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or a
portion of their
asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. In these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate
occurrence under the policy. It is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. To the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor and our other
defenses are not successful, our coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and the number of asbestos
bodily injury claims against the policyholders. Although we have seen a moderation in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate cost of these
claims.

Further,
in addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including us, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to
the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. It is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers,
including us, could be made in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs will be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on
novel legal theories of liability.

With
regard to environmental claims, we have received and continue to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of their alleged
disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these claims arise under various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and
threatened releases of hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action.
Liability under CERCLA and similar state laws may be imposed on certain parties even if they did not cause the release or threatened release of hazardous substances and may be joint and several with
other responsible parties.

The
Company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to asbestos and environmental claims. The Company believes that some
court decisions have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction
to jurisdiction.

Uncertainties
surrounding the final resolution of these asbestos and environmental claims continue, and it is difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims and related
litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without
limitation:

•

the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation;

•

a further increase in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated;



•

the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances
and lifestyle improvements;

•

the role of any umbrella or excess policies we have issued;

•

the resolution or adjudication of disputes concerning coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with our previous
assessment of these disputes;

•

the number and outcome of direct actions against us;

•

future developments pertaining to our ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims;

•

any impact on asbestos defendants we insure due to the bankruptcy of other asbestos defendants;

•

the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through
the insolvency of other participating insurers; and

•

uncertainties arising from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders.

It
is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. This
environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or
judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near
completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations
often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective.

While
the ongoing evaluation of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded
theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties regarding these claims could result in
liability in future periods that differs from current reserves by an amount that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. See the "Asbestos Claims and Litigation" and
"Environmental Claims and Litigation" sections of "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." Also see
"Item 3—Legal Proceedings."

The intense competition that we face, and the impact of innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences on the insurance industry and the markets in which we
operate,
could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability.

The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive, and
we believe that it will remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. We compete with both domestic and foreign insurers, including an increasing number of start-ups, which may offer products
at prices and on terms that are not consistent with our economic standards in an effort to maintain or increase their business. The competitive environment in which we operate could also be impacted
by current general economic conditions, which could reduce
the volume of business available to us as well as to our competitors. In recent years, pension and hedge funds and other entities with substantial available capital and potentially lower return
objectives have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses. Well-capitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and
reinsurance industries, existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital, as well as competitors that can take advantage of more favorable tax domiciles than the United States, may
conduct business in ways that adversely impact our business volumes and profitability. Further, an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely significantly on



reinsurance
and, as a consequence, those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively. In addition, the competitive environment could be impacted by changes in customer preferences,
including customer demand for direct distribution channels and/or greater choice, not only in personal lines (where we currently and may increasingly compete against direct writers), but also in
commercial lines (where direct writers may become a more significant source of competition in the future, particularly in the small commercial market). Similarly, customer behavior could evolve in the
future towards buying insurance in point-of-sale distribution channels. We do not currently have a presence in that distribution channel. Consolidation within the insurance industry also could alter
the competitive environment in which we operate, which may impact our business volumes and/or the rates or terms of our products.

In
Personal Insurance, the use of comparative rating technologies has impacted, and may continue to impact, our business as well as the industry as a whole. A substantial amount of the
Company's Personal Insurance new business is written after an agent compares quotes using comparative rating technologies, a cost-efficient means of obtaining quotes from multiple companies. Because
the use of this technology, whether by agents or directly by customers, facilitates the process of generating multiple quotes, the technology has increased price comparison on new business and,
increasingly, on renewal business. It also has resulted in an increase in the level of quote activity and a lower percentage of quotes that result in new business from customers, and these trends may
continue or accelerate. If we are not able to operate with a competitive cost structure or accurately estimate and price for claims and claim adjustment expenses, our business volume and underwriting
margins could be adversely affected over time. Additionally, similar technology is starting to be used to access comparative rates for small commercial business and that trend is likely to continue
and may accelerate.

Technology
companies or other third parties have created, and may in the future create, digitally-enabled business models, platforms or alternate distribution channels for personal or
commercial business that may adversely impact our competitive position. These technology companies or other third parties may compete with us directly by providing, or arranging to provide, insurance
coverage themselves. See also "Disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us" below.

Other
technological changes also present competitive risks. For example, innovations, such as telematics and other usage-based methods of determining premiums, can impact product design
and pricing and may become an increasingly important competitive factor. In addition, our competitive position could be impacted if we are unable to deploy, in a cost effective manner, technology that
collects and analyzes a wide variety of data points (so-called "big data" analysis) to make underwriting or other decisions, or if our competitors collect and use data which we do not have the ability
to access or use, or are able to use such data more efficiently and/or effectively than we are able to. See also "Our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information
technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology, particularly as our business processes become more digital" below.

Competitive
dynamics may impact the success of efforts to improve our underwriting margins on our insurance products. These efforts could include seeking improved rates, as well as
improved terms and conditions, and could also include other initiatives, such as reducing operating expenses and acquisition costs. These efforts may not be successful and/or may result in lower
retention and new business levels and therefore lower business volumes. In addition, if our underwriting is not effective, further efforts to increase rates could also lead to "adverse selection",
whereby accounts retained have higher losses, and are less profitable, than accounts lost. For more detail, see "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Outlook."



Similar to other industries, the insurance industry is undergoing rapid and significant technological and other change. Traditional insurance industry
participants, technology companies, "InsurTech" start-up companies, the number of which has increased significantly in recent years, and others are focused on using technology and innovation to
simplify and improve the customer experience, increase efficiencies, redesign products, alter business models and effect other potentially disruptive changes in the insurance industry. If we do not
anticipate, keep pace with and adapt to technological and other changes impacting the insurance industry, it will harm our ability to compete, decrease the value of our products to customers, and
materially and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, innovation, technological change and changing customer preferences in the markets in which we operate also pose risks to our business. For
example, technologies such as driverless vehicles, assisted-driving or accident prevention technologies, technologies that facilitate ride or home sharing, smart homes or automation could reduce the
number of vehicles in use and/or the demand for, or profitability of, certain of our products, create coverage issues or impact the frequency or severity of losses, and we may not be able to respond
effectively.

Overall,
our competitive position in our various businesses is based on many factors, including but not limited to our:

•

ability to profitably price our business, retain existing customers and obtain new business;

•

premiums charged, contract terms and conditions, products and services offered (including the ability to design customized programs);

•

agent, broker and policyholder relationships;

•

ability to keep pace relative to our competitors with changes in technology and information systems;

•

effectiveness of our claims process, including the speed of payment;

•

ability to avoid and mitigate fraudulent claims;

•

ability to provide our products and services in a cost effective manner;

•

ability to provide new products and services to meet changing customer needs;

•

ability to adapt to changes in business models, technology, customer preferences or regulation impacting the markets in which we operate;

•

perceived overall financial strength and corresponding ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;

•

reputation, experience and qualifications of employees;

•

geographic scope of business; and

•

local presence.

We
may have difficulty in continuing to compete successfully on any of these bases in the future. If competition or technological or other changes to the markets in which we operate
limit our ability to retain existing business or write new business at adequate rates or on appropriate terms, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. See "Competition"
sections of the discussion on business segments in "Item 1—Business."

Disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us

.    We market our insurance products
primarily
through independent agents and brokers. An important part of our business is written through less than a dozen such intermediaries. Further, there has been a trend of increased consolidation by agents
and brokers, which could impact our relationships with, and fees paid to, some agents and brokers, and/or otherwise negatively impact the



pricing
or distribution of our products. Agents and brokers may increasingly compete with us to the extent that markets increasingly provide them with direct access to providers of capital seeking
exposure to insurance risk. See also "The intense competition that we face could harm our ability to maintain or increase our business volumes and our profitability." In all of the foregoing
situations, loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided through such agents and brokers could materially and adversely affect our future business volume and results of operations.

We
may also seek to develop new products or distribution channels, which could disrupt our relationships with our agents and brokers. In addition, agents and brokers may create alternate
distribution channels for commercial business that may adversely impact product differentiation and pricing. Access to greater levels of data and increased utilization of technology by agents and
brokers may also impact our relationship with them and our competitive position. Our efforts or their efforts with respect to new products or alternate distribution channels, as well as changes in the
way agents and brokers utilize data and technology, could adversely impact our business relationship with independent agents and brokers who currently market our products, resulting in a lower volume
and/or profitability of business generated from these sources.

In
certain markets, brokers increasingly have been packaging portfolios of risks together and offering them to a narrower range of carriers as well as, in some cases, requesting a
commitment to participate in such portfolios in advance. In these and other situations, agents and brokers have an increased influence over policy language which, if we participate on that basis,
could adversely impact our ability to profitably manage underwriting risk. It could also lead to commoditization of products, which could increase the focus on price and cost management and decrease
our ability to differentiate our products in the marketplace with customers based on other factors.

We
rely on internet applications for the marketing and sale of certain of our products, and we may increasingly rely on internet applications and toll-free numbers for distribution. In
some instances, our agents and brokers are required to access separate business platforms to execute the sale of our personal insurance or commercial insurance products. Should internet disruptions
occur, or frustration with our business platforms or distribution initiatives develop among our independent agents and brokers, any resulting loss of business could materially and adversely affect our
future business volume and results of operations. See "If we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security (including as a result of cyber attacks), outsourcing relationships or
cloud-based technology, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted" below.

Customers
in the past have brought claims against us for the actions of our agents. Even with proper controls in place, actual or alleged errors or inaccuracies by our agents could
result in our involvement in disputes, litigation or regulatory actions related to actions taken or not taken by our agents.

We are exposed to, and may face adverse developments involving, mass tort claims such as those relating to exposure to potentially harmful products or
substances.

In addition to asbestos and environmental claims, we face potential exposure to other types of mass tort claims, including claims related to exposure
to potentially harmful products or substances, such as lead paint, silica, talc and welding rod fumes. Establishing claims and claim adjustment expense reserves for mass tort claims is subject to
uncertainties because of many factors, including expanded theories of liability, disputes concerning medical causation with respect to certain diseases, geographical concentration of the lawsuits
asserting the claims and the potential for a large rise in the total number of claims without underlying epidemiological developments suggesting an increase in disease rates. Moreover, evolving
judicial interpretations regarding the application of various tort theories and defenses, including application of various theories of joint and several liabilities, as well as the application of
insurance coverage to these claims, make it difficult to estimate our ultimate liability for such claims.



Because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the current related reserves. In addition, our estimate of claims and claim
adjustment expenses may change, and such change could be material. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could materially
and adversely affect our results of operations.

The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain.

As industry practices and legal, judicial, social and
other
environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claim and coverage may emerge. These issues may adversely affect our business, including by extending coverage beyond our
underwriting intent, by increasing the number, size or types of claims or by mandating changes to our underwriting practices. Examples of emerging claims and coverage issues include, but are not
limited to:

•

judicial expansion of policy coverage and the impact of new or expanded theories of liability;

•

plaintiffs targeting property and casualty insurers, including us, in purported class action litigation relating to claims-handling and other
practices;

•

claims relating to construction defects, which often present complex coverage and damage valuation questions;

•

claims under directors' & officers' and/or errors and omissions insurance policies relating to losses from involvement in financial
market activities, such as mortgage or financial product origination, distribution, structuring or servicing and foreclosure procedures; failed financial institutions; fraud; improper sales practices;
anti-trust allegations; possible accounting irregularities; and corporate governance issues;

•

claims related to data and network security breaches, information system failures or cyber events, particularly as the "internet of things"
becomes more prevalent, including cases where coverage was not intended to be provided;

•

the assertion of "public nuisance" or similar theories of liability, pursuant to which plaintiffs seek to recover monies spent to administer
public health care programs, abate hazards to public health and safety and/or recover damages purportedly attributable to a "public nuisance";

•

claims related to liability or workers' compensation arising out of the spread of infectious disease or pandemic;

•

claims relating to abuse by an employee or a volunteer of an insured;

•

claims that link health issues to particular causes (for example, cumulative traumatic head injury from sports or other causes), resulting in
liability or workers' compensation claims;

•

claims alleging that one or more of our underwriting criteria have a disparate impact on persons belonging to a protected class in violation of
the law, including the Fair Housing Act;

•

claims arising out of modern techniques and practices used in connection with the extraction of natural resources, such as hydraulic fracturing
or wastewater injection;

•

claims arising out of the use of personal cars, homes or other property in commercial transactions, such as ride or home sharing;

•

claims relating to unanticipated consequences of current or new technologies or business models or processes, including as a result of related
behavioral changes; and

•

claims relating to potentially changing climate conditions, including higher frequency and severity of weather-related events.



In
some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after we have issued the affected insurance policies. As a result, the full extent of liability under our
insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued.

In
addition, the potential passage of new legislation designed to expand the right to sue, to remove limitations on recovery, to deem by statute the existence of a covered occurrence, to
extend the statutes of limitations or otherwise to repeal or weaken tort reforms could have an adverse impact on our business.

The
effects of these and other unforeseen emerging claim and coverage issues are extremely hard to predict and could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our results of
operations.

We may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates or at all and we
are
exposed to credit risk related to our structured settlements.

Although the reinsurer is liable to us to the extent of the ceded reinsurance, we remain liable as
the direct insurer on all risks reinsured. As a result, ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims. Accordingly, we are subject to credit risk with respect to our
ability to recover amounts due from reinsurers.

In
the past, certain reinsurers have ceased writing business and entered into runoff. Some of our reinsurance claims may be disputed by the reinsurers, and we may ultimately receive
partial or no payment. This is a particular risk in the case of claims that relate to insurance policies written many years ago, including those relating to asbestos and environmental claims. In
addition, in a number of jurisdictions, particularly the European Union and the United Kingdom, a reinsurer is permitted to transfer a reinsurance arrangement to another reinsurer, which may be less
creditworthy, without a counterparty's consent, provided that the transfer has been approved by the applicable regulatory and/or court authority.

Included
in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to certain structured settlements. Structured settlements are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle
certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. In cases where we did not receive a release from the claimant, the structured settlement
is included in reinsurance recoverables and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as we retain the contingent liability to the claimant.
Some of the life insurance companies from which we have purchased structured settlements have been downgraded to below investment grade credit ratings subsequent to the time of the purchase. If it is
expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, we would recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by
state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to make the required annuity payments, we would be required to make such payments. For a discussion of our top
reinsurance groups by reinsurance recoverable and the top five groups by amount of structured settlements provided, see
"Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Reinsurance Recoverables."

The
availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions, both in terms of price and available capacity. The availability of reinsurance capacity can be
impacted by general economic conditions and conditions in the reinsurance market, such as the occurrence of significant reinsured events. The availability and cost of reinsurance could affect our
business volume and profitability. In addition, the Covered Agreement with the European Union recently signed by the U.S. will eliminate the requirement for European reinsurers operating in the U.S.
to provide collateral in connection with reinsurance agreements, which could make it more difficult for U.S. companies, including us, to obtain sufficient collateral, if any, in such reinsurance
arrangements.



Because
of the risks set forth above, we may not be able to collect all amounts due to us from reinsurers, and reinsurance coverage may not be available to us in the future at
commercially reasonable rates or at all, and/or life insurance companies may fail to make required annuity payments, and thus our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

We are also exposed to credit risk in certain of our insurance operations and with respect to certain guarantee or indemnification arrangements that we have with third
parties.

In addition to exposure to credit risk related to our investment portfolio and reinsurance recoverables (discussed above), we are exposed to credit risk
in several other areas of our business operations, including credit risk relating to policyholders, independent agents and brokers.

We
are exposed to credit risk in our surety insurance operations, where we guarantee to a third party that our customer will satisfy certain performance obligations (e.g., a
construction contract) or certain financial obligations, including exposure to large customers who may have obligations to multiple third parties. If our customer defaults, we may suffer losses and
not be reimbursed by that customer. In addition, it is customary practice in the surety business for multiple insurers to participate as co-sureties on large surety bonds. Under these arrangements,
the co-surety obligations are typically joint and several, in which case we are also exposed to credit risk with respect to our co-sureties.

In
addition, a portion of our business is written with large deductible insurance policies. Under casualty insurance contracts with deductible features, we are obligated to pay the
claimant the full amount of the settled claim. We are subsequently reimbursed by the contractholder for the deductible amount, and, as a result, we are exposed to credit risk to the policyholder.
Moreover, certain policyholders
purchase retrospectively rated workers' compensation and/or general liability policies (i.e., policies in which premiums are adjusted after the policy period based on the actual loss experience
of the policyholder during the policy period). Retrospectively rated policies expose us to additional credit risk to the extent that the adjusted premium is greater than the original premium.

Our
efforts to mitigate the credit risk that we have to our insureds may not be successful. To reduce such credit risk, we require certain insureds to post collateral for some or all of
these obligations, often in the form of pledged securities such as money market funds or letters of credit provided by banks, surety bonds or cash. In cases where we receive pledged securities and the
insureds are unable to honor their obligations, we may be exposed to credit risk on the securities pledged and/or the risk that our access to that collateral may be stayed during an insured's
bankruptcy. In cases where we receive letters of credit from banks and the insureds are unable to honor their obligations, we are exposed to the credit risk of the banks that issued the letters of
credit.

In
accordance with industry practice, when policyholders purchase insurance policies from us through independent agents and brokers, the premiums relating to those policies are often
paid to the agents and brokers for payment to us. In most jurisdictions, the premiums will be deemed to have been paid to us whether or not they are actually received by us. Consequently, we assume a
degree of credit risk associated with amounts due from independent agents and brokers.

To
a large degree, the credit risk we face is a function of the economy; accordingly, we face an increased credit risk in an economic downturn. While we attempt to manage the risks
discussed above through underwriting guidelines, collateral requirements and other oversight mechanisms, our efforts may not be successful. For example, collateral obtained may subsequently have
little or no value. Further, the amount of collateral protection we have been able to obtain on the business we write in certain markets has decreased, and may continue to decrease, as a result of
competition. We are also exposed to credit risk related to certain guarantee or indemnification arrangements that we have with third parties. See note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial
statements. As a result, our exposure to the above credit risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.



Within the United States, our businesses are heavily regulated by the states in which we conduct business, including licensing, market conduct and financial supervision, and changes
in
regulation may reduce our profitability and limit our growth.

These regulatory systems are generally designed to protect the interests of policyholders, and not
necessarily the interests of insurers, their shareholders and other investors. For example, to protect policyholders whose insurance company becomes financially insolvent, guaranty funds have been
established in all 50 states to pay the covered claims of policyholders in the event of an insolvency of an insurer, subject to applicable state limits. The funding
of guaranty funds is provided through assessments levied against remaining insurers in the marketplace. As a result, the insolvency of one or more insurance companies could result in additional
assessments levied against us. In addition, many states restrict the timing and/or the ability of an insurer to discontinue writing a line of business or to cancel or non-renew certain policies.

These
regulatory systems also address authorization for lines of business, statutory capital and surplus requirements, limitations on the types and amounts of certain investments,
underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, premium rates and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of an insurer's business
including, recently, cyber-security.

The
state insurance regulatory framework has been under continuing scrutiny, and some state legislatures have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to
regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies. Further, the NAIC and state insurance regulators continually re-examine existing laws and regulations, specifically focusing on
modifications to holding company regulations, interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws and regulations.

As
part of these changes, insurance holding company regulations were amended to require insurers who are part of a holding company system to file an enterprise risk report to provide the
lead insurance regulator with a summary of the company's Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework, including the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose risk to
the insurance entities within the holding company system. Insurers having premium volume above certain thresholds, including the Company, are also required to perform at least annually a
self-assessment of their current and future risks, including their likely future solvency position (known as an own risk and solvency assessment or ORSA) and file a confidential report with the
insurer's lead insurance regulator. The requirement for an insurer to conduct an ORSA is intended to foster an effective level of ERM at all insurers within a holding company system, and to provide a
group-wide perspective on risk and capital as a supplement to the legal entity view. ORSA is now included in the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) standards and is in various
stages of implementation in the United States, Europe, Canada, and other jurisdictions. It is possible that, as a result of ORSA and the manner in which it may be used by insurance regulators, our
states of domicile or other regulatory bodies may require changes in our ERM process (e.g., prescribe the use of specific models or the application of certain assumptions in the Company's
models) that have the effect of limiting our ability to write certain risks, limit our risk appetite to write additional business or reduce our capital management flexibility. See "Enterprise Risk
Management" for further discussion of the Company's ERM.

The
NAIC and state insurance regulators, as well as the Federal Reserve and Federal Insurance Office, are currently working with the IAIS to develop a global common framework (ComFrame)
for the supervision of internationally active insurance groups (IAIGs). If adopted, ComFrame would require the designation of a group-wide supervisor (regulator) for each IAIG and would impose a group
capital requirement that would be applied to an IAIG in addition to the current legal entity capital requirements imposed by state insurance laws and regulations. In response to ComFrame, the NAIC
developed a model law that allows state insurance regulators in the U.S. to be designated as group-wide supervisors for U.S.-based IAIGs. Additionally, the NAIC is developing a group capital
analytical tool that would be applied to U.S.-based insurance groups in addition to the risk-based



capital
(RBC) requirement that is applied on a legal entity basis. These regulatory developments could increase the amount of capital that the Company is required to have and could result in the
Company being subject to increased regulatory requirements.

States
may choose to adopt more restrictive insurance laws and regulations that could, among other things, restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to distribute funds to their
parent companies or they could reject rate increases due to the economic environment. The state insurance regulators may also increase the statutory capital and surplus requirements for our insurance
subsidiaries. In addition, state tax laws that specifically impact the insurance industry, such as premium taxes or other taxes, could be enacted or changed by states to raise revenues.

On
December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) was signed into law. This is the first major revision of the U.S. tax code since 1986 and its ultimate impact is
uncertain. For example, some elected state officials and regulators have criticized the new law and may attempt to take legal, legislative, or regulatory actions designed to change the TCJA's impact
on their jurisdictions.

State
laws or regulations that are adopted or amended may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus
could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.

A downgrade in our claims-paying and financial strength ratings could adversely impact our business volumes, adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets and increase
our
borrowing costs.

Claims-paying and financial strength ratings are important to an insurer's competitive position. Rating agencies periodically review insurers'
ratings and change their ratings criteria; therefore, our current ratings may not be maintained in the future. A downgrade in one or more of our ratings could negatively impact our business volumes
because demand for certain of our products may be reduced, particularly because many customers may require that we maintain minimum ratings to enter into, maintain or renew business with us.
Additionally, we may find it more difficult to access the capital markets and we may incur higher borrowing costs. If significant losses, including, but not limited to, those resulting from one or
more major catastrophes, or significant reserve additions or significant investment losses were to cause our capital position to deteriorate significantly, or if one or more rating agencies
substantially increase their capital requirements, we may need to raise equity capital in the future (which we may not be able to do at a reasonable cost or at all, especially at a time of financial
market disruption) in order to maintain our ratings or limit the extent of a downgrade. A continued trend of more frequent and severe weather-related or other catastrophes or a prolonged financial
market disruption or economic downturn may lead rating agencies to substantially increase their capital requirements. See also "During or following a period of financial market disruption or economic
downturn, our business could be materially and adversely affected." For further discussion about our ratings, see "Item 1—Business—Ratings."

The inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations, pay future shareholder
dividends
and/or make future share repurchases.

Our holding company relies on dividends from our U.S. insurance subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest
and principal on outstanding debt, to pay dividends to shareholders, to make contributions to our qualified domestic pension plan, to pay other corporate expenses and to make share repurchases. The
ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in the future will depend on their statutory capital and surplus, earnings and regulatory restrictions.

We
are subject to state insurance regulation as an insurance holding company system. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to various regulatory restrictions that limit the maximum
amount of dividends available to be paid to their parent without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. In a time of prolonged economic downturn or otherwise, insurance regulators may
choose to further restrict the ability of insurance subsidiaries to make payments to their parent companies. The ability of



our
insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company is also restricted by regulations that set standards of solvency that must be met and maintained.

The
inability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding company in an amount sufficient to meet our debt service obligations and other cash requirements could harm
our ability to meet our obligations, to pay future shareholder dividends and to make share repurchases.

Our efforts to develop new products, expand in targeted markets or improve business processes and workflows may not be successful and may create enhanced
risks.

From time to time, to protect and grow market share and/or improve our efficiency, we invest in strategic initiatives to:

•

Develop products that insure risks we have not previously insured, contain new coverages or change coverage terms;

•

Change commission terms;

•

Change our underwriting processes;

•

Improve business processes and workflow to increase efficiencies and productivity and to enhance the experience of our customers and
distributors;

•

Expand distribution channels; and

•

Enter geographic markets within or outside of the United States where we have had relatively little or no market share.

We
may not be successful in these efforts, and even if we are successful, they may create the following risks, among others:

•

Demand for new products or expansion into new markets may not meet our expectations;

•

New products and expansion into new markets may change our risk exposures, and the data and models we use to manage such exposures may not be
as effective as those we use in existing markets or with existing products;

•

Models underlying automated underwriting and pricing decisions may not be effective;

•

Efforts to develop new products or markets and to change commission terms may create or increase distribution channel conflict, such as
described above under "—Disruptions to our relationships with our independent agents and brokers could adversely affect us;"

•

In connection with the conversion of existing policyholders to a new product, some policyholders' pricing may increase while the pricing for
other policyholders may decrease, the net impact of which could negatively impact retention and profit margins; and

•

Changes to our business processes or workflow, including the use of new technologies, may give rise to execution risk.

These
efforts may require us to make substantial expenditures, which may negatively impact results in the near term, and if not successful, could materially and adversely affect our
results of operations.

We may be adversely affected if our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results.

The
profitability of our
property and casualty business substantially depends on the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we use in pricing our policies. We utilize proprietary and
third party models to help us price business in a manner that is intended to be consistent, over time, with actual results and return objectives. We incorporate the Company's historical loss
experience, external industry and other data, and economic indices into our modeling processes, and we use various methods, including predictive modeling, forecasting and sophisticated simulation
modeling techniques, to analyze loss trends and the risks



associated
with our assets and liabilities. We also use these modeling processes, analyses and methods in making underwriting, pricing and reinsurance decisions as part of managing our exposure to
catastrophes and other extreme adverse events. These modeling processes incorporate numerous assumptions and forecasts about the future level and variability of the frequency and severity of losses,
inflation, interest rates and capital requirements, among others, that are difficult to make and may differ materially from actual results.

Whether
we use a proprietary or third-party model, future experience may be materially different from past and current experience incorporated in a model's forecasts or simulations. This
includes the likelihood of events occurring or continuing or the correlation among events. Third-party models may provide substantially different indications than what our proprietary modeling
processes provide. As a result, third-party model estimates of losses can be, and often have been, materially different for similar events in comparison to our proprietary estimates. The differences
between third-party model estimates and our proprietary estimates are driven by the use of different data sets as well as different assumptions and forecasts regarding the frequency and severity of
events and claims arising from the events. In addition, as the number of third-party models increases, it becomes more difficult to validate and manage such models as they evolve over time, and the
risk associated with assimilating the output from such models into our decisions increases.

If
we fail to appropriately price the risks we insure or fail to change our pricing models to appropriately reflect our experience, or if our claims experience is more frequent or severe
than our underlying risk assumptions, our profit margins may be negatively affected. If we underestimate the frequency and/or severity of extreme adverse events occurring, our financial condition may
be adversely affected. If we overestimate the risks we are exposed to, we may overprice our products, and new business growth and retention of our existing business may be adversely affected. See
"Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Catastrophe Modeling."

Our business success and profitability depend, in part, on effective information technology systems and on continuing to develop and implement improvements in technology,
particularly as
our business processes become more digital.

We depend in large part on our technology systems for conducting business and processing claims, as well as for
providing the data and analytics we utilize to manage our business. As a result, our business success is dependent on maintaining the effectiveness of existing technology systems and on continuing to
develop and enhance technology systems that support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner, particularly as our business processes become more
digital. Some system development projects are long-term in nature, may negatively impact our expense ratios as we invest in the projects and may cost more than we expect to complete. In addition,
system development projects may not deliver the benefits or perform
as expected, or may be replaced or become obsolete more quickly than expected, which could result in operational difficulties, additional costs or accelerated recognition of expenses. If we do not
effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology portfolio, or if the costs of doing so are higher than we expect, our ability to provide competitive services to, and conduct business
with, new and existing customers in a cost effective manner and our ability to implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted.

If we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security (including as a result of cyber attacks), outsourcing relationships or cloud-based technology, our ability to
conduct our business could be negatively impacted.

While technology can streamline many business processes and ultimately reduce the cost of operations, technology
initiatives present significant risks. Our business is highly dependent upon our employees' ability to perform, in an efficient and uninterrupted fashion, necessary business functions. A shut-down of,
or inability to access, one or more of our facilities (including our primary data processing facility); a power outage; or a failure of one or more of our information technology, telecommunications or
other systems could significantly impair our ability to



perform
such functions on a timely basis, particularly if such an interruption lasts for an extended period of time. In the event of a computer virus or disaster such as a natural catastrophe,
terrorist or other attack or industrial accident, our systems could be inaccessible for an extended period of time. In addition, because our information technology and telecommunications systems
increasingly interface with and depend on third-party systems, including cloud-based, we could experience service denials or failures of controls if demand for our service exceeds capacity or a
third-party system fails or experiences an interruption. Business interruptions and failures of controls could also result if our internal systems do not interface with each other as intended or if
changes to such systems are not effectively implemented. Business continuity can also be disrupted by an event, such as a pandemic, that renders large numbers of a workforce unable to work as needed,
particularly at critical locations; for example, our largest location employs about 20% of our employees. If our business continuity plans did not sufficiently address a business interruption, system
failure or service denial, this could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business, provide customer service, pay claims in a timely manner or perform other
necessary business functions.

Our
operations rely on the reliable and secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Computer viruses, hackers
(including individuals, organizations or rogue states) and employee or vendor misconduct, and other external hazards, could expose our data systems to security breaches, cyber-attacks or other
disruptions. In addition, we routinely transmit and receive personal, confidential and proprietary information by e-mail and other electronic means. While we attempt to develop secure transmission
capabilities with third-party vendors and others with whom we do business, we may be unable to put in place secure capabilities with all of such vendors and third parties and, in addition, these third
parties may not have appropriate controls in place to protect the confidentiality of the information.

Like
other global companies, our computer systems are regularly subject to and will continue to be the target of computer viruses, malware or other malicious codes (including
ransomware), unauthorized access, cyber-attacks or other computer-related penetrations. While we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a
material cyber-security breach. However, over time, the sophistication of these threats continues to increase. Our administrative and technical controls as well as other preventative actions we take
to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our information may be insufficient to detect or prevent unauthorized access, other physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security
breaches to our computer systems or those of third parties with whom we do business. In addition, new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer
systems to the risk of cyber-attacks. Our increased use of open source software, cloud technology and software as a service can make it more difficult to identify and remedy such situations due to the
disparate location of code utilized in our operations.

We
have outsourced certain technology and business process functions to third parties and may increasingly do so in the future. If we do not effectively develop, implement and monitor
our outsourcing relationships, if third party providers do not perform as anticipated, if we experience technological or other problems with a transition, or if outsourcing relationships relevant to
our business process functions are terminated, we may not realize expected productivity improvements or cost efficiencies and may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and a loss of
business. Our outsourcing of certain technology and business process functions to third parties may expose us to increased risk related to data security, service disruptions or the effectiveness of
our control system, which could result in monetary and reputational damages or harm to our competitive position. These risks could increase as vendors increasingly offer cloud-based software services
rather than software services which can be run within our data centers. See also "We could be adversely affected if our controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and
regulatory standards are not effective." In addition to risks caused by third party providers, our ability to receive services from



third-party
providers outside of the United States might be impacted by cultural differences, political instability, unanticipated regulatory requirements or public policy inside or outside of the
United States.

The
increased risks identified above could expose us to data loss or manipulation, disruption of service, monetary and reputational damages, competitive disadvantage and significant
increases in compliance costs and costs to improve the security and resiliency of our computer systems. The compromise of personal, confidential or proprietary information could also subject us to
legal liability or regulatory action under evolving cyber-security, data protection and privacy laws and regulations enacted by the U.S. federal and state governments, Canada, the European Union or
other jurisdictions or by various regulatory organizations or exchanges. As an example, the European General Data Protection Regulation will be applicable in all European Union member states beginning
May 25, 2018. This regulation adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data and could impose a fine of
up to 4% of global annual revenue for violations. As a result, our ability to conduct our business and our results of operations might be materially and adversely affected.

We are also subject to a number of additional risks associated with our business outside the United States.

We conduct business outside
the United
States primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. In addition, we conduct business in Brazil, primarily through a joint venture, and we have an indirect interest in a joint
venture in Colombia. We may also explore opportunities in other countries, including other Latin American countries and other emerging markets such as India.

In
conducting business outside of the United States, we are also subject to a number of additional risks, particularly in emerging economies. These risks include restrictions such as
price controls, capital controls, currency exchange limits, ownership limits and other restrictive or anti-competitive governmental actions or requirements, which could have an adverse effect on our
business and our reputation. A portion of our premiums from outside of the United States is generated in Canada, a substantial portion of which consists of automobile premiums from the province of
Ontario, which is a highly regulated market. Our business activities outside the United States may also subject us to currency risk and, in some markets, it may be difficult to effectively hedge that
risk, or we may choose not to hedge that risk. In addition, in some markets, we may invest as part of a joint venture with a local counterparty. Because our governance rights may be limited, we may
not have control over the ability of the joint venture to make certain decisions and/or mitigate risks it faces, and significant disagreements with a joint venture counterparty may adversely impact
our investment and/or reputation. Our business activities outside the United States could subject us to increased volatility in earnings resulting from the need to recognize and subsequently revise a
valuation allowance associated with income taxes if we became unable to fully utilize any deferred tax assets, including loss carry-forwards from those foreign operations. Also, political instability,
particularly in emerging economies, and changing market conditions around the globe, could result in financial market disruption or an economic downturn in such regions.

Our
business activities outside the United States also subject us to additional domestic and foreign laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws in
other countries that prohibit the making of improper payments to foreign officials. Although we have policies and controls in place that are designed to ensure compliance with these laws, if those
controls are ineffective and an employee or intermediary fails to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties and our business and our reputation could be
adversely affected. Some countries, particularly emerging economies, have laws and regulations that lack clarity and, even with local expertise and effective controls, it can be difficult to determine
the exact requirements of, and potential liability under, the local laws. In some jurisdictions, including Brazil, parties to a joint venture may, in some circumstances, have liability for some
obligations of the venture, and that liability may extend beyond the capital invested. Failure to comply with local laws in a



particular
market may result in substantial liability and could have a significant and negative effect not only on our business in that market but also on our reputation generally.

In
addition, competition for skilled employees in developing markets and other non-U.S. locations may be intense. If we are not able to hire, integrate, motivate and retain a sufficient
number of employees with the knowledge and background necessary for our global businesses, those businesses and our results of operations may be adversely affected.

Regulatory changes outside of the United States, including in Canada, the U.K. and the European Union, could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our
growth.

Insurance laws or regulations that are adopted or amended in jurisdictions outside the U.S. may be more restrictive than current laws or regulations and
may result in lower revenues and/or higher costs of compliance and thus could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and limit our growth.

In
particular, the European Union's executive body, the European Commission, implemented new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called Solvency II on January 1, 2016
that apply to the Company's businesses across the European Union. Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II
requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary's capital position is dependent on the parent company and the U.S. parent is not already subject to regulations deemed "equivalent" to
Solvency II. In addition, regulators in countries where the Company has operations are working with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS) (and with the NAIC, the Federal
Reserve and FIO in the U.S.) to consider changes to insurance company supervision, including group supervision and group capital requirements.

The
IAIS has developed a methodology for identifying "global systemically important insurers" (G-SIIs) and high level policy measures that will apply to the G-SIIs. The methodology and
measures were endorsed by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) created by the G-20. Using the IAIS methodology, the FSB, working with national authorities and the IAIS, identified nine insurers in
November 2016 that they designated as G-SIIs. The IAIS is working on the policy measures which include higher capital requirements and enhanced supervision. The Company has not been designated as a
G-SII by the FSB; however, the FSB updates the list annually, and it is possible that the methodologies could be amended or interpreted differently in the future and the Company could be named as a
G-SII.

The
IAIS is also in the process of developing the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (ComFrame). As the current draft of ComFrame is
completed, it likely will lead to similar policy measures as those being developed for G-SIIs being made applicable
to internationally active insurance groups (or "IAIGs"), including group supervision, group capital requirements, and resolution planning, i.e., a written plan developed by a financial group
detailing how it would be wound down in the event of an insolvency. The IAIS is currently in the process of field testing the group capital requirements. The Company would be considered an
Internationally Active Insurance Group under the current Consultation Draft. It is possible that ComFrame, if adopted, could lead to enhanced supervision and higher capital standards on a global basis
if the IAIS, the NAIC and the individual states adopt the proposed or similar provisions.

The
U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) entered into a covered agreement (the Covered Agreement) in September 2017 regarding
prudential (solvency) insurance and reinsurance measures with the European Union (EU). The EU is expected to approve the agreement later in 2018. The Covered Agreement includes three areas of
prudential insurance supervision related to: reinsurance contracts, group supervision, and the exchange of information between U.S. and EU insurers and the respective insurance regulators. The Covered
Agreement is intended to promote cooperation between the U.S. and EU insurance regulators and is intended to limit the ability of the EU to apply solvency and group capital requirements to the



worldwide
operations of any U.S. insurer operating in the EU. It is possible that individual members of the EU could choose to apply none or only parts of the Covered Agreement, resulting in greater
regulation and higher capital standards as well as inconsistent regulatory requirements among the jurisdictions that the Company does business.

While
it is not yet known how or if these actions will impact us, such regulation could result in increased costs of compliance, increased disclosure and less flexibility in our capital
management, and could adversely impact our results of operations and limit our growth.

Loss of or significant restrictions on the use of particular types of underwriting criteria, such as credit scoring, or other data or methodologies, in the pricing and underwriting
of
our products could reduce our future profitability.

Our underwriting profitability depends in large part on our ability to competitively price our products at a
level that will adequately compensate us for the risks assumed. As a result, risk selection and pricing through the application of actuarially sound and segmented underwriting criteria is critical.
However, laws or regulations, or judicial or administrative findings, could significantly curtail the use of particular types of underwriting criteria. For example, we may use credit scoring as a
factor in pricing decisions where allowed by state law. Some consumer groups and/or regulators have alleged that the use of credit scoring violates the law by discriminating against persons belonging
to a protected class and are calling for the prohibition or restrictions on the use of credit scoring in underwriting and pricing. A variety of other underwriting criteria and other data or
methodologies used in personal and commercial insurance have been and continue to be criticized by
regulators, government agencies, consumer groups or individuals on similar or other grounds. Resulting regulatory actions or litigation could result in negative publicity and/or generate adverse rules
or findings, such as curtailing the use of important underwriting criteria, or other data or methodologies, each of which could adversely affect our future profitability.

Acquisitions and integration of acquired businesses may result in operating difficulties and other unintended consequences.

From time
to time we may
pursue acquisition opportunities if we believe that such opportunities are consistent with our long-term objectives and that the potential rewards of an acquisition justify the risks. The process of
integrating an acquired company or business can be complex and costly, however, and may create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. For example, acquisitions may present significant
risks, including:

•

the potential disruption of our ongoing business;

•

the ineffective integration of, or other difficulties with, underwriting, risk management, claims handling, information technology and
actuarial practices;

•

uncertainties related to an acquiree's reserve estimates and its design and operation of internal controls over financial reporting;

•

the diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges;

•

the loss of key employees;

•

unforeseen liabilities;

•

difficulties in achieving the strategic objectives of an acquisition, including the business, financial, technological or distribution
objectives;

•

the cultural challenges associated with integrating employees; and

•

the impact on our financial position and/or credit ratings.

The
expected benefits of acquired businesses may not be realized, any cost savings and other synergies anticipated from the acquisition may not be achieved and costs associated with the
integration may be greater than anticipated. Acquired businesses may not be successfully integrated, resulting in



substantial
costs or delays and adversely affecting our ability to compete. Accordingly, our results of operations might be materially and adversely affected.

We could be adversely affected if our controls designed to ensure compliance with guidelines, policies and legal and regulatory standards are not
effective.

Our business is highly dependent on our ability to engage on a daily basis in a large number of insurance underwriting, claim processing and investment
activities, many of which are highly complex. These activities often are subject to internal guidelines and policies, as well as legal and regulatory standards. A control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system's objectives will be met. If our controls are not effective, it could lead to financial loss, unanticipated risk
exposure (including underwriting, credit and investment risk), errors in financial reporting or damage to our reputation. See also "If we experience difficulties with technology, data and network
security (including as a result of
cyber attacks), outsourcing relationships, or cloud-based technology, our ability to conduct our business could be negatively impacted."

In
addition, ineffective controls, including with respect to any joint ventures or recently acquired businesses, could lead to litigation or regulatory action. The volume of claims and
amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against various types of financial institutions have increased over time. Substantial legal liability or significant
regulatory action against us could have a material adverse financial impact. See note 16 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain legal proceedings in which
we are involved.

Our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees.

There is significant competition from
within the
property and casualty insurance industry and from businesses outside the industry for qualified employees, especially those in key positions and those possessing highly specialized knowledge in areas
such as underwriting, data and analytics, technology and e-commerce. Our performance is largely dependent on the talents, efforts and proper conduct of highly-skilled individuals, including our senior
executives (many of whom have decades of experience in the insurance industry), and the Board of Directors regularly engages in succession discussions. See "Item 10—Directors,
Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" for more information relating to our executive officers, including our senior leaders. For many of our senior positions, we compete for talent not just
with insurance or financial service companies, but with other large companies and other businesses. Our continued ability to compete effectively in our businesses and to expand into new business areas
depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. If we are not able to successfully attract, retain and motivate our employees, our business,
financial results and reputation could be materially and adversely affected.

Intellectual property is important to our business, and we may be unable to protect and enforce our own intellectual property or we may be subject to claims for infringing the
intellectual property of others.

Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our proprietary trademarks, technology and other intellectual property.
See "Item 1—Other Information—Intellectual Property." We may not, however, be able to protect our intellectual property from unauthorized use and disclosure by others.
Further, the intellectual property laws may not prevent our competitors from independently developing trademarks, products and services that are similar to ours. Moreover, the agreements we execute to
protect our intellectual property rights may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies in response. Our attempts to patent or register our intellectual property rights in the U.S. and
worldwide may not succeed initially or may later be challenged by third parties. Further, the laws of certain countries outside the United States may not adequately protect our intellectual property
rights. We may incur significant costs in our efforts to protect and enforce our intellectual property, including the initiation of expensive and protracted litigation, and we may not prevail. Any
inability to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.



We
may be subject to claims by third parties from time to time that our products, services and technologies infringe on their intellectual property rights. In recent years, certain
entities have acquired patents in order to allege claims of infringement against companies, including in some cases, us. Any intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could cause us
to spend significant time and money to defend ourselves, regardless of the merits of the claims. If we are found to infringe any third-party intellectual property rights, it could result in
reputational harm, payment of significant monetary damages, payment of license fees (if licenses are even available to us, on reasonable terms or otherwise) and/or substantial time and expense to
redesign our products, services or technologies to avoid the infringement. In addition, we use third party software in some of our products, services and technologies. If any of our software vendors
or licensors are faced with infringement claims, we may lose our ability to use such software until the dispute is resolved. If we cannot successfully redesign an infringing product, service or
technology (or procure a substitute version), this could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to compete.

Changes in federal regulation could impose significant burdens on us and otherwise adversely impact our results.

The Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) established a Federal Insurance Office (FIO) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The FIO has limited regulatory authority and is
empowered to gather data and information regarding the insurance industry and insurers, but it has in the past recommended an expanded federal role in some circumstances. The Dodd-Frank Act also gives
the Federal Reserve supervisory authority over a number of nonbank financial services holding companies, including insurance companies, if they are designated by a two-thirds vote of a Financial
Stability Oversight Council (the FSOC) as "systemically important financial institutions" (SIFI) or own a bank or thrift. The Company, based upon the FSOC's rules and interpretive guidance, has not
been designated as a SIFI and is not subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve. In addition, the Federal Reserve appears to be moving away from SIFI designations altogether. Nonetheless, it is
possible that FSOC may change its rules or interpretations in the future and conclude that we are a SIFI. If we were designated as a SIFI, the Federal Reserve's supervisory authority could include the
ability to impose heightened financial regulation and could impact requirements regarding our capital, liquidity and leverage as well as our business and investment conduct. The Dodd-Frank Act also
authorizes assessments to pay for the resolution of SIFI's that have become insolvent. We (as a financial company with more than $50 billion in assets) could be assessed, and although any such
assessment is required to be risk weighted (i.e., riskier firms pay more), such costs could be material to us and are not currently estimable. As a result of the foregoing, the Dodd-Frank Act,
including any changes thereto as a result of its current re-evaluation or otherwise, or other additional federal regulation that is adopted in the future, could impose additional burdens on us,
including impacting the ways in which we conduct our business, increasing compliance costs and duplicating state regulation, and could result in a competitive disadvantage, particularly relative to
other competitors that may not be subject to the same level of regulation.

Even
if we are not subject to additional regulation by the federal government, significant financial sector regulatory reform could have a significant impact on us. For example,
regulatory reform could have an unexpected impact on our rights as a creditor or on our competitive position. The current administration is reviewing rules and regulations across the entire federal
regulatory spectrum, including Treasury, the SEC, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Labor and other agencies, as well as treaty relationships with parties to the North American Free
Trade Agreement. We expect executive action on regulatory changes to continue in 2018 and beyond.

Other
potential changes in U.S. federal legislation, regulation and/or administrative policies, including the potential repeal of the McCarran-Ferguson Act (which exempts insurance from
most federal regulation), could also significantly harm the insurance industry, including us.



Changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact us.

Tax laws may change
in ways that
adversely impact us, including increasing the statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate. Alternatively, federal tax legislation could be enacted to further reduce the existing statutory U.S.
federal corporate income tax rate from 21%, which would, accordingly, reduce any U.S. net deferred tax asset. The amount of any net deferred tax asset is volatile and significantly impacted by changes
in unrealized investment gains and losses. The effect of a reduction in a tax rate on net deferred tax assets is required to be recognized, in full, as a reduction of income from continuing operations
in the period when enacted and, along with other changes in the tax rules that may increase the Company's actual tax expense, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In
addition, a reduction in the existing statutory U.S. federal corporate income tax rate could increase the after-tax effect of future significant loss events and our after-tax borrowing costs.
Additional uncertainties exist with respect to potential technical corrections and clarifications to the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

Our
investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions and certain other tax laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received
deductions and tax credits. Federal and/or state tax legislation could be enacted in connection with deficit reduction or various types of fundamental tax reform that would lessen or eliminate some or
all of the tax advantages currently benefiting us and therefore could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, such legislation could adversely affect the value of our
investment portfolio, particularly changes to the taxation of interest from municipal bonds (which comprise 43% of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2017), which could materially and
adversely impact the value of those bonds.

Other
tax law changes could materially and adversely impact our results of operations. For example, budget constraints faced by many states and localities increase the likelihood that
state and local governments will raise revenue by enacting legislation increasing the taxes paid by individuals and corporations.

Item 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

NONE.

Item 2.    PROPERTIES

The Company leases its principal executive offices in New York, New York, as well as approximately 224 field and claim offices totaling
approximately 4.5 million square feet throughout the United States under leases or subleases with third parties. The Company also leases offices in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of
Ireland, Brazil, India and China that house operations (primarily for Business Insurance) in those locations. The Company owns six buildings in Hartford, Connecticut, consisting of approximately
1.8 million square feet of office space. The Company also owns buildings located in other areas of Connecticut; Norcross, Georgia; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Omaha, Nebraska. The Company
owns a building in London, England, which houses a portion of Business Insurance's operations in the United Kingdom.

In
the opinion of the Company's management, the Company's properties are adequate and suitable for its business as presently conducted and are adequately maintained.

Company paid cash dividends per share of $2.83 in 2017 and $2.62 in 2016. Future dividend decisions will be based on, and affected by, a number of factors, including the operating
results and financial requirements of the Company and the impact of dividend restrictions. For information on dividends, as well as restrictions on the ability of certain of the Company's subsidiaries
to transfer funds to the Company in the form of cash dividends or otherwise, see "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources." Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available and subject to any other
restrictions that may be applicable to the Company.



SHAREHOLDER RETURN PERFORMANCE GRAPH

The following graph shows a five-year comparison of the cumulative total return to shareholders for the Company's common stock and the common
stock of companies included in the S&P 500 Index and the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index, which the Company believes is the most appropriate comparative index.

(1)

The
cumulative return to shareholders is a concept used to compare the performance of a company's stock over time and is the ratio of the net stock price change plus
the cumulative amount of dividends over the specified time period (assuming dividend reinvestment) to the stock price at the beginning of the time period.

$100 invested in common shares of The Travelers Companies, Inc. on December 31, 2012.

(3)

Companies
in the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index as of December 31, 2017 were the following: The Travelers Companies, Inc.,
Chubb Limited, Cincinnati Financial Corporation, The Progressive Corporation, The Allstate Corporation and XL Group Ltd.

Returns
of each of the companies included in this index have been weighted according to their respective market capitalizations.

A
long-term perspective is particularly important in the property and casualty insurance industry, where the periodic occurrences of significant catastrophes have historically produced results that
can vary significantly year-to-year. Accordingly, management manages with a long-term perspective. For the ten-year period ended December 31, 2017, the Company's cumulative return to
shareholders was 224% as compared to 126% for the S&P 500 Index and 157% for the S&P 500 Property & Casualty Insurance Index.

The
Company's Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading
plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The
timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses,
maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's
operating subsidiaries, legal
requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors.

The
Company acquired 5,998 shares for a total cost of approximately $0.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017 that were not part of the publicly
announced share repurchase authorization. These shares consisted of shares retained to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance
share awards, and shares used by employees to cover the price of certain stock options that were exercised.

For
additional information regarding the Company's share repurchases, see "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources."

Information
relating to compensation plans under which the Company's equity securities are authorized for issuance is set forth in Part III—Item 12 of this
Report.

Realignment of Reportable Business Segments

Effective April 1, 2017, the Company's results are reported in the following three business segments—Business Insurance,
Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, reflecting a change in the manner in which the Company's businesses were being managed as of that date, as well as the aggregation of products
and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which risks are underwritten. While the segmentation of the Company's domestic businesses was unchanged, the
Company's international businesses, which were previously managed and reported in total within the Business and International Insurance segment, were disaggregated by product type among the three
newly aligned reportable business segments. All prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. In connection with these changes, the Company revised the names and
descriptions of certain businesses comprising the Company's segments and has reflected other related changes. The following discussion of segment results is based on the realigned reportable business
segment structure effective April 1, 2017.

The
following discussions of the Company's net income and segment income are presented on an after-tax basis. Discussions of the components of net income and segment income are presented
on a pre-tax basis, unless otherwise noted. Discussions of earnings per common share are presented on a diluted basis.

Overview

Diluted net income per share of $7.33 in 2017 decreased by 29% from diluted net income per share of $10.28 in 2016. Net income of
$2.06 billion in 2017 decreased by 32% from net income of $3.01 billion in 2016. The lower rate of decrease in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in
recent periods. The decrease in net income primarily reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower net favorable prior year reserve
development, (iii) lower underwriting margins excluding catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development ("underlying underwriting margins") and (iv) lower other income in 2017 due
to a favorable settlement of a reinsurance dispute in 2016, partially offset by (v) higher net realized investment gains and (vi) higher net investment income. Catastrophe losses in 2017
and 2016 were $1.95 billion and $877 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 was $592 million and $771 million, respectively.
The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impacts of (i) loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in



Business
Insurance, (ii) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses in Business Insurance and (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Personal Insurance, partially offset
by (iv) increased business volumes. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in income was a related decrease in income tax expense. Income tax expense also included a net charge of
$129 million to reflect the change in tax laws and tax rates enacted in the U.S. on December 22, 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), resulting primarily from
revaluing the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities and the tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings. In addition, income tax expense in 2017 was reduced by $39 million as a result
of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

Diluted
net income per share of $10.28 in 2016 decreased by 6% from diluted net income per share of $10.88 in 2015. Net income of $3.01 billion in 2016 decreased by 12% from net
income of $3.44 billion in 2015. The lower rate of decrease in diluted net income per share reflected the impact of share repurchases in recent periods. The decrease in net income primarily
reflected the pre-tax impacts of (i) higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins, (iii) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and
(iv) lower net investment income, partially offset by (v) higher other revenues and (vi) higher net realized investment gains. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 were
$877 million and $514 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 was $771 million and $941 million, respectively. The lower
underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from (i) higher loss estimates in the personal automobile product line for bodily injury liability coverages, (ii) the impact of loss
cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in Business Insurance and (iii) higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by (iv) lower non-catastrophe fire-related
losses and other loss activity in Business Insurance. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in income was a related decrease in income tax expense. Income tax expense in 2015 was also reduced
by $32 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

The
Company has insurance operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and throughout other parts of the world as a corporate member of Lloyd's, as well as in Brazil
and Colombia, primarily through joint ventures. Because these operations are conducted in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the Company is subject to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted reported line items in the statement of income by insignificant amounts. The
impact of these changes was not material to the Company's net income or segment income for the periods reported.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

Earned premiums in 2017 were $25.68 billion, $1.15 billion or 5% higher than in 2016. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in
2017 increased by 2% over 2016. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, earned premiums in 2017 increased by 2% over 2016. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2017 increased by 10% over 2016.
Earned premiums in 2016 were $24.53 billion, $660 million or 3% higher than in 2015. In Business Insurance, earned premiums in 2016 increased by 1% over 2015. In Bond & Specialty
Insurance, earned premiums in 2016 were comparable to 2015. In Personal Insurance, earned premiums in 2016 increased by 6% over 2015. Factors contributing to the changes in earned premiums in each
segment in 2017 and 2016 compared with the respective prior year are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.

Net
investment income in 2017 was $2.40 billion, $95 million or 4% higher than in 2016. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2017 was
$1.89 billion, $86 million lower than in 2016. The decrease primarily resulted from lower long-term reinvestment rates available in the market, partially offset by the impact of a
slightly higher average level of fixed maturity investments. Net investment income from short-term securities in 2017 was $62 million, $33 million higher than in 2016, primarily due to
higher short-term interest rates and a higher average level of short-term investments. Net investment
income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2017 was $478 million, $148 million higher than in 2016, primarily due to higher returns from private equity limited partnerships.

Net
investment income in 2016 was $2.30 billion, $77 million or 3% lower than in 2015. Net investment income from fixed maturity investments in 2016 was
$1.98 billion, $110 million lower than in 2015. The decrease in net investment income from fixed maturity investments primarily resulted from lower long-term reinvestment rates available
in the market and a modestly lower amount of fixed income investments that were impacted by the Company's $524 million payment related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc.
litigation in the second quarter of 2016. Net investment income from short-term securities in 2016 was $29 million, $17 million higher than in 2015, primarily due to higher short-term
interest rates. Net investment income generated by non-fixed maturity investments in 2016 was $330 million, $13 million higher than in 2015, primarily due to higher returns from private
equity limited partnerships, partially offset by lower returns from real estate partnerships.

Fee Income

The National Accounts market in Business Insurance is the primary source of the Company's fee-based business. Fee income is described in more
detail in the Business Insurance discussion that follows.

Net Realized Investment Gains

Other Net Realized Investment Gains

Other net realized investment gains in 2017 included $236 million of net realized investment gains related to equity securities,
$10 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales, $4 million of net realized gains related to fixed maturity investments and $20 million of net realized
investment losses related to other investments.

Other
net realized investment gains in 2016 included $59 million of net realized gains related to fixed maturity investments, $14 million of net realized investment gains
related to equity securities, $7 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales and $17 million of net realized investment gains related to other investments.

Other
net realized investment gains in 2015 included $81 million of net realized gains related to fixed maturity investments, $6 million of net realized investment gains
related to equity securities, $2 million of net realized investment gains from real estate sales and $34 million of net realized investment losses related to other investments. The net
realized investment losses related to other investments included $26 million of realized foreign exchange translation losses incurred in connection with the Company's increased ownership of
Travelers Participações em Seguros Brasil S.A.

Other Revenues

Other revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges. Other revenues in 2017 also included revenues from Simply Business,
which was acquired in August 2017. Other revenues in 2017 and 2016 also included gains related to the settlement of reinsurance disputes (discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements). Other revenues in 2016 also included proceeds from the favorable settlement of a claims-related legal matter.

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $17.47 billion, $2.40 billion or 16% higher than in 2016, primarily reflecting
the impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures, (iii) loss cost trends, (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve
development, (v) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses in Business Insurance and (vi) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Personal Insurance. Catastrophe losses in 2017
primarily
resulted from wildfires in California, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and several winter, wind and hail storms throughout the United States.

Claims
and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 were $15.07 billion, $1.35 billion or 10% higher than in 2015, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher volumes of
insured exposures, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher catastrophe losses, (iv) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (v) higher loss estimates in the
personal automobile product line for bodily injury liability coverages, partially offset by (vi) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity in Business Insurance.
Catastrophe losses in 2016 primarily resulted from Hurricane Matthew, wind and hail storms in several regions of the United States, flooding in the Southeast region of the United States, wildfires in
Canada and Tennessee, and winter storms in the eastern United States. Catastrophe losses in 2015 primarily resulted from wildfires in California, and several winter, wind and hail storms throughout
the United States.

Factors
contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes
to the consolidated financial statements.



Significant Catastrophe Losses

The Company defines a "catastrophe" as an event that:

•

is designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic
events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada; and

•

the Company's estimates of its ultimate losses before reinsurance and taxes exceed a pre-established dollar threshold.

The
Company's threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the
other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an
aggregate threshold is applied for International business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2017 ranged from approximately $17 million to $30 million of losses before
reinsurance and taxes.

The
following table presents the amount of losses recorded by the Company for significant catastrophes that occurred in 2017, 2016 and 2015, the amount of net unfavorable (favorable)
prior year reserve development recognized in 2017 and 2016 for catastrophes that occurred in 2016 and 2015, and the estimate of ultimate losses for those catastrophes at December 31, 2017, 2016
and 2015. For purposes of the table, a significant catastrophe is an event for which the Company estimates its ultimate losses will be $100 million or more after reinsurance and before taxes.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs

Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2017 was $4.17 billion, $181 million or 5% higher than in 2016. Amortization of
deferred acquisition costs in 2016 was $3.99 billion,
$100 million or 3% higher than in 2015. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs is discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.



General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses in 2017 were $4.17 billion, comparable with 2016. General and administrative expenses in 2016 were
$4.15 billion, $60 million or 1% higher than in 2015. General and administrative expenses are discussed in more detail in the segment discussions that follow.

Interest Expense

Interest expense in 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $369 million, $363 million and $373 million, respectively.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense in 2017 was $674 million, $365 million or 35% lower than in 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the
$1.32 billion decrease in income before income taxes in 2017 and the $39 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters, partially offset
by the net charge of $129 million as part of the TCJA described above. Income tax expense in 2016 was $1.04 billion, $262 million or 20% lower than in 2015, primarily reflecting
the impact of the $687 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2016.

The
Company's effective tax rate was 25%, 26% and 27% in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rates in all years were lower than the statutory rate of 35% primarily due
to the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's income tax provision. In addition, the effective tax rate in 2017 was increased by the net charge related to TCJA
described above and was reduced by the impact of the resolution of prior year tax matters discussed above.

Combined Ratio

The combined ratio of 97.9% in 2017 was 5.9 points higher than the combined ratio of 92.0% in 2016.

The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.2% in 2017 was 6.7 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.5% in 2016. Catastrophe losses accounted for 7.6
points and 3.6 points of the 2017 and 2016 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 provided 2.3 points and 3.2 points of
benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The loss and loss adjustment expense ratio excluding
catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development ("underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio") in 2017 was 1.8 points higher than the 2016 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting
(i) loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in Business Insurance, (ii) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses in Business Insurance and (iii) higher
non-catastrophe weather-related losses in Personal Insurance.

The
underwriting expense ratio of 30.7% in 2017 was 0.8 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 31.5% in 2016.

The
combined ratio of 92.0% in 2016 was 3.7 points higher than the combined ratio of 88.3% in 2015.

The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 60.5% in 2016 was 3.9 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 56.6% in the same period of 2015. Catastrophe losses
accounted for 3.6 points and 2.1 points of the 2016 and 2015 loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 provided 3.2 points
and 3.9 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2016 was 1.7 points higher than the 2015 ratio on the
same basis, primarily reflecting (i) higher loss estimates in the personal automobile product line for bodily injury liability



coverages
and (ii) the impact of loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing in Business Insurance, partially offset by (iii) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and
other loss activity in Business Insurance.

The
underwriting expense ratio of 31.5% was 0.2 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 31.7% in 2015.

Overview

Segment income in 2017 was $1.61 billion, $369 million or 19% lower than segment income of $1.98 billion in 2016, primarily
reflecting the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower other income due to a favorable settlement of a reinsurance dispute in 2016 and
(iii) lower underlying underwriting margins, partially offset by (iv) higher net investment income. Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016 were $858 million and $463 million,
respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 was $439 million and $424 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted
from the impacts of (i) loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing and (ii) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in
segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense. In addition, income tax expense in 2017 was reduced by $15 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

Segment
income in 2016 was $1.98 billion, $95 million or 5% lower than segment income of $2.08 billion in 2015, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impacts of
(i) higher catastrophe losses, (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins and (iii) lower net investment income, partially offset by (iv) higher other revenues and
(v) higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 were $463 million and $245 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve
development in 2016 and 2015 was $424 million and $332 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from (i) the impact of loss cost trends
that modestly exceeded earned pricing and (ii) higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by (iii) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity.
Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

Earned premiums of $14.15 billion in 2017 were $291 million or 2% higher than in 2016. Earned premiums of $13.86 billion in
2016 were $157 million or 1% higher than in 2015. The increase in earned premiums in both 2017 and 2016 reflected increases in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.

Net Investment Income

Net investment income in 2017 was $1.79 billion, $85 million or 5% higher than in 2016. Net investment income in 2016 was
$1.70 billion, $56 million or 3% lower than in 2015. Refer to the "Net Investment Income" section of the "Consolidated Results of Operations" discussion for a description of the factors
contributing to the changes in the Company's consolidated net investment income in 2017 and 2016 compared with the respective prior years. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's net investment income allocation methodology.

Fee Income

National Accounts is the primary source of fee income due to its service businesses, which include claim and loss prevention services to large
companies that choose to self-insure a portion of their insurance risks, as well as claims and policy management services to workers' compensation residual market pools. Fee income in 2017 was
$430 million, $12 million or 3% lower than in 2016, primarily reflecting lower serviced premium volume due to the depopulation of
workers' compensation residual market pools. Fee income in 2016 was $442 million, $3 million or 1% lower than in 2015.



Other Revenues

Other revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges. Other revenues in 2017 included revenues from Simply Business, which
was acquired in August 2017. Other revenues in 2017 and 2016 also included gains related to the settlement of reinsurance disputes. Additionally, other revenues in 2016 included proceeds from the
favorable settlement of a claims-related legal matter.

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $9.52 billion, $768 million or 9% higher than in 2016, primarily reflecting the
impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) loss cost trends, (iii) higher volumes of insured exposures and (iv) higher non-catastrophe fire-related
losses. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 were $8.75 billion, $344 million or 4% higher than in 2015, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) loss cost trends and
(ii) higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (iii) lower non-catastrophe fire-related losses and other loss activity.

Factors
contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes
to the consolidated financial statements.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs

Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2017 was $2.29 billion, $65 million or 3% higher than in 2016. Amortization of
deferred acquisition costs in 2016 was $2.22 billion, $39 million or 2% higher than in 2015. The increases in both 2017 and 2016 were generally consistent with the increases in earned
premiums.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses in 2017 were $2.56 billion, which were comparable with 2016. General and administrative expenses in
2016 were $2.55 billion, $49 million or 2% higher than in 2015, primarily reflecting higher employee and technology related expenses.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense in 2017 was $448 million, $208 million or 32% lower than in 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the
$577 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2017 and the $15 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters. Income tax
expense in 2016 was $656 million, $88 million or 12% lower than in 2015, primarily reflecting the $183 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2016.

Combined Ratio

The combined ratio of 97.8% in 2017 was 3.7 points higher than the combined ratio of 94.1% in 2016.

The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 65.9% in 2017 was 4.2 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.7% in 2016. Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016
accounted for 6.0 points and 3.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 3.1 points of benefit to the loss and loss
adjustment expense ratio in both 2017 and 2016. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2017 was 1.6 points higher than the 2016 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the
impacts of (i) loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing and (ii) higher non-catastrophe fire-related losses.



The underwriting expense ratio of 31.9% in 2017 was 0.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 32.4% in 2016.

The
combined ratio of 94.1% in 2016 was 2.1 points higher than the combined ratio of 92.0% in 2015.

The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 61.7% in 2016 was 1.8 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 59.9% in 2015. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015
accounted for 3.4 points and 1.8 points, respectively, of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 provided 3.1 points and 2.4 points
of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2016 was 0.9 points higher than the 2015 ratio on the same basis.

The

Overview

Segment income in 2017 was $556 million, $156 million or 22% lower than segment income of $712 million in 2016, primarily
reflecting the pre-tax impacts of (i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins. Net favorable prior year reserve



development
in 2017 and 2016 was $140 million and $350 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in both 2017 and 2016 were $6 million. The lower underlying underwriting margins
primarily reflected a higher level of international surety losses. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense. In addition, income
tax expense in 2017 was reduced by $17 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

Segment
income in 2016 was $712 million, $29 million or 4% higher than segment income of $683 million in 2015, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impact of
(i) higher net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by (ii) lower net investment income. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 and 2015 was
$350 million and $281 million, respectively. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 were $6 million and $3 million, respectively. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax
increase in segment income was a related increase in income tax expense.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

Earned premiums in 2017 were $2.31 billion, $47 million or 2% higher than in 2016, primarily reflecting an increase in net written
premiums over the preceding twelve months. Earned premiums of $2.26 billion in 2016 were comparable with 2015.

Net Investment Income

Net investment income in 2017 was $228 million, $11 million or 5% lower than in 2016. Net investment income in 2016 was
$239 million, $15 million or 6% lower than in 2015. Included in Bond & Specialty Insurance are certain legal entities whose invested assets and related net investment income are
reported exclusively in this segment and not allocated among all business segments. As a result, reported net investment income in Bond & Specialty Insurance reflects a significantly smaller
proportion of allocated net investment income, including that from the Company's non-fixed maturity investments that experienced an increase in investment income in 2017 and 2016. Refer to the "Net
Investment Income" section of the "Consolidated Results of Operations" discussion for a description of the factors contributing to the changes in the Company's consolidated net investment income in
2017 and 2016 compared with the respective prior years. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Company's net investment income
allocation methodology.

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $899 million, $266 million or 42% higher than in 2016, primarily reflecting
(i) lower net favorable prior year reserve development and (ii) a higher level of international surety losses. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 were $633 million,
$86 million or 12% lower than in 2015, primarily reflecting higher net favorable prior year reserve development.

Factors
contributing to net favorable prior year reserve development during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes
to the consolidated financial statements.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs

Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2017 was $432 million, $11 million or 3% higher than in 2016, generally consistent
with the increase in earned premiums. Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2016 was $421 million, $3 million or 1% higher than in 2015.



General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses in 2017 were $464 million, $19 million or 4% higher than in 2016, primarily reflecting higher
employee and technology related expenses. General and administrative expenses in 2016 were $445 million, $5 million or 1% higher than in 2015.

Income Tax Expense

Income tax expense in 2017 was $208 million, $101 million or 33% lower than in 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of the
$257 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2017 and the $17 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters. Income tax
expense in 2016 was $309 million, $26 million or 9% higher than in 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of the $55 million increase in income before income taxes in 2016.

Combined Ratio

The combined ratio of 77.4% in 2017 was 11.7 points higher than the combined ratio of 65.7% in 2016.

The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 38.6% in 2017 was 11.2 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 27.4% in 2016. Net favorable prior year reserve
development in 2017 and 2016 provided 6.1 points and 15.5 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016 accounted for 0.3 points
of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in each year. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2017 was 1.8 points higher than the 2016 ratio on the same basis, primarily
reflecting the impact of a higher level of international surety losses.

The
underwriting expense ratio of 38.8% in 2017 was 0.5 points higher than the underwriting expense ratio of 38.3% in 2016.

The
combined ratio of 65.7% in 2016 was 3.4 points lower than the combined ratio of 69.1% in 2015.

The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 27.4% in 2016 was 3.9 points lower than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 31.3% in 2015. Net favorable prior year reserve
development in 2016 and 2015 provided 15.5 points and 12.4 points of benefit, respectively, to the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Catastrophe losses in 2016 and 2015 accounted for 0.3 points
and 0.1 points, respectively, of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio in 2016 was 1.0 points lower than the 2015 ratio on the same basis.

The

Overview

Segment income in 2017 was $128 million, $389 million or 75% lower than segment income of $517 million in 2016, primarily
reflecting the pre-tax impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, partially offset by (ii) higher net investment income, (iii) higher underlying underwriting margins
and (iv) net favorable prior year reserve development as compared to net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016. Catastrophe losses in 2017 and 2016 were $1.09 billion and
$408 million, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 was $13 million, compared with net unfavorable prior year reserve development of $3 million in
2016. The higher underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from the impacts of (i) increased business volumes and (ii) earned pricing that modestly exceeded loss cost trends,
partially offset by (iii) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense. In
addition, income tax expense in 2017 was reduced by $7 million as a result of the resolution of prior year tax matters.

Segment
income in 2016 was $517 million, $415 million or 45% lower than segment income of $932 million in 2015, primarily reflecting the pre-tax impacts of
(i) net unfavorable prior year reserve development as compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015, (ii) lower underlying underwriting margins and (iii) higher
catastrophe losses. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016 was $3 million, compared with net favorable prior year reserve development of $328 million in 2015. Catastrophe
losses in 2016 and 2015 were $408 million and $266 million, respectively. The lower underlying underwriting margins primarily resulted from higher loss estimates in the Automobile
product line for bodily injury liability coverages. Partially offsetting this net pre-tax decrease in segment income was a related decrease in income tax expense.

Revenues

Earned Premiums

Earned premiums in 2017 were $9.23 billion, $811 million or 10% higher than in 2016. Earned premiums in 2016 were
$8.42 billion, $510 million or 6% higher than in 2015. The increase in earned premiums in both 2017 and 2016 reflected increases in net written premiums over the preceding twelve months.



Net Investment Income

Net investment income in 2017 was $383 million, $21 million or 6% higher than in 2016. Net investment income in 2016 was
$362 million, $6 million or 2% lower than in 2015. Refer to the "Net Investment Income" section of "Consolidated Results of Operations" for a discussion of the changes in the Company's
net investment income in 2017 and 2016 as compared with the respective prior year. In addition, refer to note 2 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the
Company's net investment income allocation methodology.

Other Revenues

Other revenues in all years presented included installment premium charges.

Claims and Expenses

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expenses

Claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2017 were $7.05 billion, $1.36 billion or 24% higher than in 2016, primarily reflecting
the impacts of (i) significantly higher catastrophe losses, (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures, (iii) loss cost trends and (iv) higher non-catastrophe weather-related
losses, partially offset by (v) net favorable prior year reserve development as compared with net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016. Claims and claim adjustment expenses in
2016 were $5.68 billion, $1.09 billion or 24% higher than in 2015, primarily reflecting (i) higher volumes of insured exposures, (ii) net unfavorable prior year reserve
development as compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015, (iii) higher catastrophe losses, (iv) higher loss estimates in the Automobile product line for bodily
injury liability coverages and (v) the impact of loss cost trends.

Net
prior year reserve development in 2017 and 2016 was not significant. Factors contributing to prior year reserve development during the year ended December 31, 2015 are
discussed in more detail in note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Amortization of Deferred Acquisition Costs

Amortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2017 was $1.45 billion, $105 million or 8% higher than in 2016. Amortization of
deferred acquisition costs in 2016 was $1.34 billion, $58 million or 5% higher than in 2015. The increases in both 2017 and 2016 were generally consistent with the increases in earned
premiums.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses in 2017 were $1.11 billion, $13 million or 1% lower than in 2016. General and administrative
expenses of $1.12 billion in 2016 were comparable with 2015.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)

The income tax benefit in 2017 was $(44) million, compared with income tax expense of $192 million in 2016, primarily reflecting the
impact of the $625 million decrease in income before income taxes in 2017, and the $7 million reduction in income tax expense resulting from the resolution of prior year tax matters.
Income tax expense in 2016 was $192 million, $224 million or 54% lower than in 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of the $639 million decrease in income before income taxes in
2016. The level of income tax expense (benefit) in all years reflected the impact of tax-exempt investment income on the calculation of the Company's tax provision.



Combined Ratio

The combined ratio of 103.1% in 2017 was 7.3 points higher than the combined ratio of 95.8% in 2016.

The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 76.3% in 2017 was 8.8 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.5% in 2016. Catastrophe losses accounted for 11.7
points and 4.9 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 provided 0.1 points of benefit to the loss and
loss adjustment expense ratio. Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016 had no impact on the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio
in 2017 was 2.1 points higher than the 2016 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses, (ii) the tenure impact of
higher levels of new business in recent years in the Automobile product line and (iii) a higher level of automobile business relative to homeowners and other business, partially offset by
(iv) earned pricing that modestly exceeded loss cost trends.

The
underwriting expense ratio of 26.8% in 2017 was 1.5 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 28.3% in 2016, primarily reflecting the impact of higher levels of earned
premiums.

The
combined ratio of 95.8% in 2016 was 8.4 points higher than the combined ratio of 87.4% in 2015.

The
loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 67.5% in 2016 was 9.4 points higher than the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio of 58.1% in 2015. Net unfavorable prior year reserve
development in 2016 had no impact on the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Net favorable prior year reserve development provided 4.2 points of benefit to the loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio in 2015. Catastrophe losses accounted for 4.9 points and 3.4 points of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The underlying loss and loss adjustment expense
ratio in 2016 was 3.7 points higher than the 2015 ratio on the same basis, primarily reflecting (i) higher loss estimates in the Automobile product line for bodily injury liability coverages,
(ii) the tenure impact of higher levels of new business in recent years in the Automobile product line and (iii) a higher level of automobile business relative to homeowners and other
business.

The
underwriting expense ratio of 28.3% in 2016 was 1.0 points lower than the underwriting expense ratio of 29.3% in 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of higher levels of earned
premiums.

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

The Company believes that the property and casualty insurance industry has suffered from court decisions and other trends that have expanded
insurance coverage for asbestos claims far beyond the original intent of insurers and policyholders. The Company has received and continues to receive a significant number of asbestos claims from the
Company's policyholders (which includes others seeking coverage under a policy). Factors underlying these claim filings include continued intensive advertising by lawyers seeking asbestos claimants
and the continued focus by plaintiffs on defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation. The focus on these defendants is primarily the result of the number of
traditional asbestos defendants who have sought bankruptcy protection in previous years. In addition to contributing to the overall number of claims, bankruptcy proceedings may increase the volatility
of asbestos-related losses by initially delaying the reporting of claims and later by significantly accelerating and increasing loss payments by insurers, including the Company. The bankruptcy of many
traditional defendants has also caused increased settlement demands against those policyholders who are not in bankruptcy but remain in the tort system. Currently, in many jurisdictions, those who
allege very serious injury and who can present credible medical evidence of their injuries are receiving priority trial settings in the courts, while those who have not shown any credible disease
manifestation are having their hearing dates delayed or placed on an inactive docket. Prioritizing claims involving credible evidence of injuries, along with the focus on defendants who were not
traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation, contributes to the claims and claim adjustment expense payment patterns experienced by the Company. The Company's asbestos-related claims and
claim adjustment expense experience also has been impacted by the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or
through the insolvency of other participating insurers.

The
Company continues to be involved in coverage litigation concerning a number of policyholders, some of whom have filed for bankruptcy, who in some instances have asserted that all or
a portion of their asbestos-related claims are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage. In these instances, policyholders also may assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated
as a separate occurrence under the policy. It is difficult to predict whether these policyholders will be successful on both issues. To the extent both issues are resolved in a policyholder's favor
and other Company defenses are not successful, the Company's coverage obligations under the policies at issue would be materially increased and bounded only by the applicable per-occurrence limits and
the number of asbestos bodily injury claims against the policyholders. Although the Company has seen a reduction in the overall risk associated with these lawsuits, it remains difficult to predict the
ultimate cost of these claims.

Many
coverage disputes with policyholders are only resolved through settlement agreements. Because many policyholders make exaggerated demands, it is difficult to predict the outcome of
settlement negotiations. Settlements involving bankrupt policyholders may include extensive releases which are favorable to the Company but which could result in settlements for larger amounts than
originally anticipated. There also may be instances where a court may not approve a proposed



settlement,
which may result in additional litigation and potentially less beneficial outcomes for the Company. As in the past, the Company will continue to pursue settlement opportunities.

In
addition to claims against policyholders, proceedings have been launched directly against insurers, including the Company, by individuals challenging insurers' conduct with respect to
the handling of past asbestos claims and by individuals seeking damages arising from alleged asbestos-related bodily injuries. Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) had previously entered into
settlement agreements in connection with a number of these direct action claims (Direct Action Settlements). The Company had been involved in litigation concerning whether all of the conditions of the
Direct Action Settlements had been satisfied. On July 22, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that all of the conditions of the Direct Action Settlements had
been satisfied. On January 15, 2015, the bankruptcy court entered an order directing the Company to pay $579 million to the plaintiffs, comprised of the $502 million settlement
amounts, plus pre- and post-judgment interest of $77 million, which the Company paid in 2015. It is possible that the filing of other direct actions against insurers, including the Company,
could be made in the future. It is difficult to predict the outcome of these proceedings, including whether the plaintiffs would be able to sustain these actions against insurers based on novel legal
theories of liability. The Company believes it has meritorious defenses to any such claims and has received favorable rulings in certain jurisdictions.

On
January 29, 2009, the Company and PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), along with approximately 30 other insurers of PPG, agreed in principle to settle asbestos-related coverage
litigation under insurance policies issued to PPG (the "Agreement"). The Agreement was incorporated into the Modified Third Amended Plan of Reorganization ("Amended Plan") proposed as part of the
Pittsburgh Corning Corp. (PCC, which is 50% owned by PPG) bankruptcy proceeding. Pursuant to the Amended Plan, which was filed on January 30, 2009, PCC, along with enumerated other companies
(including PPG as well as the Company as a participating insurer), receive protections afforded by Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code from certain asbestos-related bodily injury claims.
Under the Agreement, the Company had the option to make a series of payments over 20 years totaling approximately $620 million to the trust created under the Amended Plan, or it could
elect to make a discounted payment. On January 7, 2016, the remaining objections to the Amended Plan were dismissed. On April 27, 2016, the Amended Plan became effective and all the
remaining conditions to the Agreement were satisfied. The Company fully satisfied its obligation under the Agreement by making a discounted payment in the second quarter of 2016. The Company's payment
totaled $524 million, of which $518 million was related to asbestos reserves. The Company's obligations under the Agreement were included in its claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves at December 31, 2015.

Because
each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the exposure presented by each policyholder at least annually. Among the factors
which the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits
and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future
claim activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of
non-asbestos claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos
claim is a products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.



In
the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and
"non-product" liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:

•

a high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness, primarily
involving mesothelioma claims;

•

while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to a high level
of litigation activity; and

•

a moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity.

In
the Home Office and Field Office category, which accounts for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, the number of policyholders tendering asbestos
claims for the first time and the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims declined slightly when compared to 2016 while gross asbestos-related payments were higher. Payments on behalf of
policyholders in this category continue to be influenced by a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury,
primarily mesothelioma, continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation.

The
Company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder
bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the Home Office and Field Office, and Assumed Reinsurance and Other
categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any
emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves and the Company's evaluations
have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.

The
completion of these reviews and analyses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted in $225 million, $225 million and $224 million increases, respectively, in the Company's
net asbestos reserves. In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of
policyholders in the Home Office category due to a higher than previously anticipated level of litigation activity surrounding mesothelioma claims. This increase in the estimate of projected
settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above. Over the past
decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes
that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company's overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by
exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained
in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company's overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment
is essentially unchanged from recent periods and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.

The
Policyholders with Settlement Agreements category includes structured settlements, coverage in place arrangements and, with respect to TPC, Wellington accounts (as discussed below).
Reserves are based on the expected payout for each policyholder under the applicable agreement. Structured
settlements are arrangements under which policyholders and/or plaintiffs agree to fixed financial amounts to be paid at scheduled times. Coverage in place arrangements represent agreements with
policyholders on specified amounts of coverage to be provided. Payment obligations may be subject to annual maximums and are only made when valid claims are presented. Wellington accounts refer to the
35 defendants that are parties to a 1985 agreement settling certain disputes concerning insurance coverage for their asbestos claims. Many of the aspects of the Wellington agreement are similar to
those of coverage in place arrangements in which the parties have agreed on specific amounts of coverage and the terms under which the coverage can be accessed. In 2016, the Company paid the
$518 million settlement related to asbestos-related coverage litigation under insurance policies issued to PPG, as described above.

The
Home Office and Field Office category relates to all other policyholders and also includes IBNR reserves and reserves for the costs of defending asbestos-related coverage litigation.
IBNR reserves in the Home Office and Field Office category include amounts for new claims and adverse development on existing Home Office and Field Office policyholders, as well as reserves for claims
from policyholders reporting asbestos claims for the first time and for policyholders for which there is, or may be, litigation. Policyholders are identified for the annual home office review based
upon, among other factors: a combination of past payments and current case reserves in excess of a specified threshold (currently $100,000), perceived level of exposure, number of reported claims,
products/completed operations and potential "non-product" exposures, size of policyholder and geographic distribution of products or services sold by the policyholder. The Assumed Reinsurance and
Other category primarily consists of reinsurance of excess coverage, including various pool participations.

Net
asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $271 million, $708 million and $770 million, respectively. Net payments in 2016 included the
$458 million payment related to the PPG settlement, as described above. Net payments in 2015 included the $502 million payment related to the Direct Action Settlements as described
above. Approximately 4%, 69% and 69% of total net paid losses in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the
Company's liability.

"—Uncertainty
 Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental Reserves."

ENVIRONMENTAL CLAIMS AND LITIGATION

The Company has received and continues to receive claims from policyholders who allege that they are liable for injury or damage arising out of
their alleged disposition of toxic substances. Mostly, these claims are due to various legislative as well as regulatory efforts aimed at environmental remediation. For instance, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation
and Liability Act (CERCLA), enacted in 1980 and later modified, enables private parties as well as federal and state governments to take action with respect to releases and threatened releases of
hazardous substances. This federal statute permits the recovery of response costs from some liable parties and may require liable parties to undertake their own remedial action. Liability under CERCLA
may be joint and several with other responsible parties.

The
Company has been, and continues to be, involved in litigation involving insurance coverage issues pertaining to environmental claims. The Company believes that some court decisions
have interpreted the insurance coverage to be broader than the original intent of the insurers and policyholders. These decisions often pertain to insurance policies that were issued by the Company
prior to the mid-1980s. These decisions continue to be inconsistent and vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Environmental claims, when submitted, rarely indicate the monetary amount being sought
by the claimant from the policyholder, and the Company does not keep track of the monetary amount being sought in those few claims which indicate a monetary amount.

The
resolution of environmental exposures by the Company generally occurs through settlements with policyholders as opposed to claimants. Generally, the Company strives to extinguish any



obligations
it may have under any policy issued to the policyholder for past, present and future environmental liabilities and extinguish any pending coverage litigation dispute with the policyholder.
This form of settlement is commonly referred to as a "buy-back" of policies for future environmental liability. In addition, many of the agreements have also extinguished any insurance obligation
which the Company may have for other claims, including, but not limited to, asbestos and other cumulative injury claims. The Company and its policyholders may also agree to settlements which
extinguish any liability arising from known specified sites or claims. Where appropriate, these agreements also include indemnities and hold harmless provisions to protect the Company. The Company's
general purpose in executing these agreements is to reduce the Company's potential environmental exposure and eliminate the risks presented by coverage litigation with the policyholder and related
costs.

In
establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and the anticipated cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis,
the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. In addition, the Company considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature
of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the
corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site; the overall nature of the insurance relationship between
the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other
available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims or potential
non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. The evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information concerning that
policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. Conventional actuarial methods are not used to estimate these reserves.

In
its review of environmental reserves, the Company considers: past settlement payments; changing judicial and legislative trends; its reserves for the costs of litigating environmental
coverage matters; the potential for policyholders with smaller exposures to be named in new clean-up actions for both on-and off-site waste disposal activities; the potential for adverse development;
the potential for additional new claims beyond previous expectations; and the potential higher costs for new settlements.

The
duration of the Company's investigation and review of these claims and the time necessary to determine an appropriate estimate, if any, of the value of the claim to the Company vary
significantly and are dependent upon a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, the cooperation of the policyholder in providing claim information, the pace of underlying
litigation or claim processes, the pace of coverage litigation between the policyholder and the Company and the willingness of the policyholder and the Company to negotiate, if appropriate, a
resolution of any dispute pertaining to these claims. Because these factors vary from claim-to-claim and policyholder-by-policyholder, the Company cannot provide a meaningful average of the duration
of an environmental claim. However, based upon the Company's experience in resolving these claims, the duration may vary from months to several years.

The
Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These policyholders continue to
present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based
site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental
claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less
than anticipated. In addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims has been greater than anticipated,



driven
by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As a result of these factors, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by
$65 million, $82 million and $72 million, respectively.

Net
environmental paid loss and loss expenses were $88 million, $61 million and $55 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. At December 31, 2017,
approximately 94% of the net environmental reserve
(approximately $340 million) was carried in a bulk reserve and included unresolved environmental claims, incurred but not reported environmental claims and the anticipated cost of coverage
litigation disputes relating to these claims. The bulk reserve the Company carries is established and adjusted based upon the aggregate volume of in-process environmental claims and the Company's
experience in resolving those claims. The balance, approximately 6% of the net environmental reserve (approximately $20 million), consists of case reserves.

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING ADEQUACY OF ASBESTOS AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVES

As a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves carried for asbestos and environmental claims
are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these claims continue, and it is difficult
to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new information becomes available and as claims
develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the bankruptcy protection sought by various
asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims beyond that which is anticipated, the
emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than



anticipated
as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle improvements, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the Company has issued, the resolution or
adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the Company's previous assessment of these claims, the
number and outcome of direct actions against the Company, future developments pertaining to the Company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of
other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. In addition, uncertainties arise
from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. It is also not possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future
development of asbestos and environmental claims. This environment could be affected by changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the
outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex
coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is adjudicated. This is particularly the case
with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective. As part of its continuing analysis of
asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.

Because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company's current insurance reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of
claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement
charges that could be material to the Company's operating results in future periods.

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

The Company's invested assets at December 31, 2017 were $72.50 billion, of which 93% was invested in fixed maturity and short-term
investments, 1% in equity securities, 1% in real estate investments and 5% in other investments. Because the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to fund future claims payments, the Company
employs a conservative investment philosophy. A significant majority of funds available for investment are deployed in a widely diversified portfolio of high quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government,
tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.

The
carrying value of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2017 was $62.69 billion. The Company closely monitors the duration of its fixed maturity
investments, and investment purchases and sales are executed with the objective of having adequate funds available to satisfy the Company's insurance and debt obligations. The weighted average credit
quality of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio, both including and excluding U.S. Treasury securities, was "Aa2" at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. Below investment grade securities
represented 2.7% and 2.9% of the total fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and
short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2017 and 4.2 (4.5 excluding short-term securities) at December 31, 2016.

Obligations of States, Municipalities and Political Subdivisions

The Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $30.92 billion and $31.91 billion,
respectively, of securities which are obligations of states, municipalities and political subdivisions (collectively referred to as the municipal bond portfolio). The municipal bond portfolio is
diversified across the United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico and includes general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states, cities, counties, school districts and similar
issuers. Included in the municipal bond portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $3.90 billion and $5.16 billion, respectively, of pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for
which states or municipalities have established irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities.
These trusts were created to fund the payment of principal and interest due under the bonds. The irrevocable trusts are verified as to their sufficiency by an independent verification agent of the
underwriter, issuer or trustee. All of the Company's holdings of securities issued by Puerto Rico and related entities have been pre-refunded and therefore are defeased by U.S. Treasury securities.

Rated
using external rating agencies or by the Company when a public rating does not exist. The table includes $335 million of short-term securities which
have the highest ratings issued by external rating agencies for short-term issuances. For purposes of this table, the short-term securities, which are rated "A-1+" and/or "P-1," are included as "Aaa"
rated securities.

In
addition to fixed maturities noted in the foregoing table, the Company has exposure totaling $153 million to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships
(both of which are included in other investments in the Company's consolidated balance sheet) whose primary investing focus is across Europe. The Company has unfunded commitments totaling
$134 million to these partnerships. The Company has no non-redeemable preferred stock issued by companies in the Eurozone.

Mortgage-Backed Securities, Collateralized Mortgage Obligations and Pass-Through Securities

The Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $2.41 billion and $1.71 billion,
respectively, of residential mortgage-backed securities, including pass-through-securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), all of which are subject to prepayment risk (either
shortening or lengthening of duration). While prepayment risk for securities and its effect on income cannot be fully controlled, particularly when interest rates move dramatically, the Company's
investment strategy generally favors securities that reduce this risk within expected interest rate ranges. The Company makes investments in residential CMOs that are either guaranteed by GNMA, FNMA
or FHLMC, or if not guaranteed, are senior or super-senior positions within their respective securitizations. Both guaranteed and non-guaranteed residential CMOs allocate the distribution of payments
from the underlying mortgages among different classes of bondholders. In addition, non-guaranteed residential CMOs provide structures that allocate the impact of credit losses to different classes of
bondholders. Senior and super-senior CMOs are protected, to varying degrees,



from
credit losses as those losses are initially allocated to subordinated bondholders. The Company's investment strategy is to purchase CMO tranches that are expected to offer the most favorable
return given the Company's assessment of associated risks. The Company does not purchase residual interests
in CMOs. For more information regarding the Company's investments in residential mortgage-backed securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Alternative Documentation Mortgages and Sub-Prime Mortgages

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio included CMOs backed by alternative documentation
mortgages and asset-backed securities collateralized by sub-prime mortgages with a collective fair value of $111 million and $142 million, respectively (comprising less than 1% of the
Company's total fixed maturity investments at both dates). The Company defines sub-prime mortgage-backed securities as investments in which the underlying loans primarily exhibit one or more of the
following characteristics: low FICO scores, above-prime interest rates, high loan-to-value ratios or high debt-to-income ratios. Alternative documentation securitizations are those in which the
underlying loans primarily meet the government-sponsored entities' requirements for credit score but do not meet the government-sponsored entities' guidelines for documentation, property type, debt
and loan-to-value ratios. The weighted average credit rating on these securities and obligations held by the Company was "B1" and "Ba3" at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company
does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size.

Commercial Mortgage-Backed Securities and Project Loans

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (including FHA project loans) of
$1.17 billion and $938 million, respectively. The Company does not believe this portfolio exposes it to a material adverse impact on its results of operations, financial position or
liquidity, due to the portfolio's relatively small size and the underlying credit strength of these securities. For more information regarding the Company's investments in commercial mortgage-backed
securities, see note 3 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Equity Securities Available for Sale, Real Estate and Short-Term Investments

See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information about these invested asset classes.

Other Investments

The Company also invests in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. Also included in other investments
are non-public common and preferred equities and derivatives. These asset classes have historically provided a higher return than fixed maturities but are subject to more volatility. At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying value of the Company's other investments was $3.53 billion and $3.45 billion, respectively.

Securities Lending

The Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of
its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $304 million and $286 million of securities on loan, respectively,
as part of a tri-party lending agreement. The average monthly balance of securities on loan during 2017 and 2016 was $318 million and $346 million, respectively. Borrowers of these
securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities



plus
accrued interest. The Company has not incurred any investment losses in its securities lending program for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

Lloyd's Trust Deposits

The Company meets its capital requirements to support its underwriting at Lloyd's using a combination of trust deposits and uncollateralized
letters of credit. Securities with a fair value of approximately $37 million and $97 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31,
2017 and 2016, respectively, and $33 million held by TRV at December 31, 2017, were pledged into Lloyd's trust accounts to provide a portion of the Lloyd's capital requirements. For more
information regarding the Company's utilization of uncollateralized letters of credit, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources" herein.

Net
unrealized investment gains included in shareholders' equity at December 31, 2017 increased from the prior year-end, primarily reflecting the impact of a decrease in market
interest rates in 2017 and the tax effect of the TCJA. Net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders' equity at December 31, 2016 decreased from the prior year-end, primarily
reflecting the impact of an increase in market interest rates in 2016.

At
December 31, 2017, the amount of gross unrealized losses for all fixed maturity and equity investments reported at fair value for which fair value was less than 80% of
amortized cost for fixed maturity investments and cost for equity investments was not significant.

For
fixed maturity investments where fair value is less than the carrying value and the Company did not reach a decision to impair, the Company continues to have the intent and ability
to hold such investments to a projected recovery in value, which may not be until maturity.

At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, below investment grade securities comprised 2.7% and 2.9%, respectively, of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio. Included in below
investment grade securities at December 31, 2017 were securities in an unrealized loss position that, in the aggregate, had an amortized cost of $313 million and a fair value of
$305 million, resulting in a net pre-tax unrealized investment loss of $8 million. These securities in an unrealized loss position represented approximately 0.5% of the total amortized
cost and 0.5% of the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2017 and accounted for 4.5% of the total gross pre-tax unrealized investment loss in the fixed maturity portfolio
at December 31, 2017.

Purchases
and sales of investments are based on cash requirements, the characteristics of the insurance liabilities and current market conditions. The Company identifies investments to
be sold to achieve its primary investment goals of assuring the Company's ability to meet policyholder obligations as well as to optimize investment returns, given these obligations.

CATASTROPHE MODELING

The Company uses various analyses and methods, including proprietary and third-party computer modeling processes, to make underwriting and
reinsurance decisions designed to manage its exposure to catastrophic events. There are no industry-standard methodologies or assumptions for projecting catastrophe exposure. Accordingly, catastrophe
estimates provided by different insurers may not be comparable.

The
Company actively monitors and evaluates changes in third-party models and, when necessary, calibrates the catastrophe risk model estimates delivered via its own proprietary modeling
processes. The Company considers historical loss experience, recent events, underwriting practices, market share analyses, external scientific analysis and various other factors including non-modeled
losses, to refine its proprietary view of catastrophe risk. These proprietary models are continually updated as new information and techniques emerge.



The tables below set forth the probabilities that estimated losses, comprising claims and allocated claim adjustment expenses (but excluding unallocated claim
adjustment expenses), from a single event occurring in a one-year timeframe will equal or exceed the indicated loss amounts (expressed in dollars, net of tax at the newly enacted federal tax rate of
21%, and as a percentage of the Company's common equity), based on the proprietary and third-party computer models utilized by the Company at December 31, 2017. For example, on the basis
described below the tables, the Company estimates that there is a one percent chance that the Company's loss from a single U.S. and Canadian hurricane in a one-year timeframe would equal or exceed
$1.6 billion, or 7% of the Company's common equity at December 31, 2017.

(1)

An
event that has, for example, a 2% likelihood of exceedance is sometimes described as a "1-in-50 year event." As noted above, however, the probabilities in
the table represent the likelihood of losses from a single event equaling or exceeding the indicated threshold loss amount in a one-year timeframe, not over a multi-year timeframe. Also, because the
probabilities relate to a single event, the probabilities do not address the likelihood of more than one event occurring in a particular period, and, therefore, the amounts do not address potential
aggregate catastrophe losses occurring in a one-year timeframe.

(2)

The
percentage of common equity is calculated by dividing (a) indicated loss amounts in dollars by (b) total common equity excluding net unrealized
investment gains and losses, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity. Net unrealized investment gains and losses can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors
and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends. Accordingly, the Company's management uses the percentage of common equity calculated on this basis as a metric to evaluate the potential impact
of a single hurricane or single earthquake on the Company's financial position for purposes of making underwriting and reinsurance decisions.

The
threshold loss amounts in the tables above, which are based on the Company's in-force portfolio at December 31, 2017 and catastrophe reinsurance program at January 1,
2018, are net of reinsurance, after-tax and exclude unallocated claim adjustment expenses, which historically have been less than 10% of loss estimates. For further information regarding the Company's
reinsurance, see "Item 1—Reinsurance." The amounts for hurricanes reflect U.S. and Canadian exposures and include property exposures, property residual market exposures and an
adjustment for certain non-property exposures. The hurricane loss amounts are based on the Company's catastrophe risk model estimates and include losses from the hurricane hazards of wind and storm
surge. The amounts for earthquakes



reflect
U.S. and Canadian property and workers' compensation exposures. The Company does not believe that the inclusion of hurricane or earthquake losses arising from other geographical areas or other
exposures would materially change the estimated threshold loss amounts.

Catastrophe
modeling relies upon inputs based on experience, science, engineering and history. These inputs reflect a significant amount of judgment and are subject to changes which may
result in volatility in the modeled output. Catastrophe modeling output may also fail to account for risks that are outside the range of normal probability or are otherwise unforeseeable. Catastrophe
modeling assumptions include, among others, the portion of purchased reinsurance that is collectible after a catastrophic event, which may prove to be materially incorrect. Consequently, catastrophe
modeling estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. In the tables above, the uncertainty associated with the estimated threshold loss amounts increases significantly as the likelihood of
exceedance decreases. In other words, in the case of a relatively more remote event (e.g., 1-in-1,000), the estimated threshold loss amount is relatively less reliable. Actual losses from an
event could materially exceed the indicated threshold loss amount. In addition, more than one such event could occur in any period.

Moreover,
the Company is exposed to the risk of material losses from other than property and workers' compensation coverages arising out of hurricanes and earthquakes, and it is exposed
to catastrophe losses from perils other than hurricanes and earthquakes, such as tornadoes and other windstorms, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other
naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares, as well as acts of terrorism and cyber events.

For
more information about the Company's exposure to catastrophe losses, see "Item 1A

—

Risk
Factors

—

Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and
could adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and "Item 1A—Risk Factors—We may be adversely affected if
our pricing and capital models provide materially different indications than actual results."

CHANGING CLIMATE CONDITIONS

Severe weather events over the last two decades have underscored the unpredictability of future climate trends and created uncertainty regarding
insurers' exposures to
financial loss as a result of catastrophes and other weather-related events. For example, hurricane and storm surge activity have impacted areas further inland than previously experienced, and
demographic changes have resulted in larger populations in coastal areas which historically have been subject to severe storms, thus expanding the Company's potential for losses from hurricanes.
Additionally, both the frequency and severity of tornado and hail storms in the United States have been more volatile during the last decade. Accordingly, the Company may be subject to increased
losses from catastrophes and other weather-related events. Demographic changes in areas prone to wildfires have also expanded the Company's potential for losses from wildfires. Additionally, the
Company's catastrophe models may be less reliable due to the increased unpredictability in frequency and severity of severe weather events or other emerging trends in climate conditions.

The
Company discusses how potentially changing climate conditions may present other issues for its business under "Item 1A—Risk Factors" and "Outlook." For example,
among other things:

•

Increasingly unpredictable and severe weather conditions could result in increased frequency and severity of claims under policies issued by
the Company. See "Risk Factors—Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could adversely impact our
ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance" and "—Outlook—Underwriting Gain/Loss."

•

Changing climate conditions could also impact the creditworthiness of issuers of securities in which the Company invests. For example, water
supply adequacy could impact the



creditworthiness
of bond issuers in the Southwestern United States, and more frequent and/or severe hurricanes could impact the creditworthiness of issuers in the Southeastern United States, among
other areas. See "Risk Factors—Our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risk, and may suffer reduced returns or material realized or unrealized losses."

•

Increased regulation adopted in response to potential changes in climate conditions may impact the Company and its customers. For example,
state insurance regulation could impact the Company's ability to manage property exposures in areas vulnerable to significant climate driven losses. If the Company is unable to implement risk based
pricing, modify policy terms or reduce exposures to the extent necessary to address rising losses related to catastrophes and smaller scale weather events (should those increased losses occur), its
business may be adversely affected. See "Risk Factors—Catastrophe losses could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, our financial position and/or liquidity, and could
adversely impact our ratings, our ability to raise capital and the availability and cost of reinsurance." In addition, climate change regulation could increase the Company's customers' costs of doing
business. For example, insureds faced with carbon management regulatory requirements may have less available capital for investment in loss prevention and safety features which may, over time,
increase loss exposures. Increased regulation may also result in reduced economic activity, which would decrease the amount of insurable assets and businesses.

•

The full range of potential liability exposures related to changing climate conditions continues to evolve. Through the Company's Emerging
Issues Committee and its Committee on Climate, Energy and the Environment, the Company works with its business units and corporate groups, as appropriate, to identify and try to assess climate
change-related liability issues, which are continually evolving and often hard to fully evaluate. The Company regularly reviews emerging issues, including changing climate conditions, to consider
potential changes to its modeling and the use of such modeling, as well as to help determine the need for new underwriting strategies, coverage modifications or new products. See "Risk
Factors—The effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain."

REINSURANCE RECOVERABLES

The Company reinsures a portion of the risks it underwrites in order to control its exposure to losses. For additional discussion regarding the
Company's reinsurance coverage, see "Part I—Item 1—Reinsurance."

The
$127 million increase in net reinsurance recoverables over December 31, 2016 primarily reflected the impacts of catastrophe losses and the asbestos reserve increase in
2017, partially offset by cash collections in 2017, including the settlement of certain disputes as discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

At
December 31, 2017, the Company held $972 million of collateral in the form of letters of credit, funds and trust agreements held to fully or partially collateralize
certain reinsurance recoverables.

Included
in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to structured settlements, which are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to settle certain personal
physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the amount due from the life
insurance company related to the structured settlement is included in the Company's consolidated balance sheet as a reinsurance recoverable and the related claim cost is included in the liability for
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would
recognize an impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance
company fails to make the required annuity
payments, the Company would be required to make such payments. The following table presents the Company's top five groups by structured settlements at December 31, 2017 (in millions).

On
November 30, 2017, CF Corporation acquired Fidelity & Guaranty Life and changed its name to FGL Holdings.

On
October 23, 2016, Genworth Financial (Genworth) announced that they have entered into a definitive agreement under which China Oceanwide Holdings
Group Co., Ltd. (China Oceanwide) agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Genworth. On March 7, 2017, Genworth stockholders adopted the merger agreement, and the
acquisition is pending the receipt of required regulatory approvals. China Oceanwide is a privately held, family-owned international financial holding group headquartered in Beijing, China. On
February 12, 2018, A.M. Best downgraded the financial strength rating of Genworth Life & Annuity Insurance Company to B+ (Good) from B++ (Good), and downgraded Genworth Life
Insurance Company and Genworth Life Insurance Company of New York to B– (Fair) from B (Fair) and has maintained the under-review status of all ratings and revised the implications to
developing from negative. The parties to the transaction agreed to extend the closing deadline for the transaction until April 1, 2018.



The
Company considers the ratings and related outlook assigned to reinsurance companies and life insurance companies by various independent ratings agencies in assessing the adequacy of
its allowance for uncollectible amounts.

OUTLOOK

The following discussion provides outlook information for certain key drivers of the Company's results of operations and capital position.

Premiums.

The Company's earned premiums are a function of net written premium volume. Net written premiums comprise both renewal
business and new
business and are recognized as earned premium over the life of the underlying policies. When business renews, the amount of net written premiums associated with that business may increase or decrease
(renewal premium change) as a result of increases or decreases in rate and/or insured exposures, which the Company considers as a measure of units of exposure (such as the number and value of vehicles
or properties insured). Net written premiums from both renewal and new business, and therefore earned premiums, are impacted by competitive market conditions as well as general economic conditions,
which, particularly in the case of Business Insurance, affect audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations. Property and casualty insurance market conditions are expected
to remain competitive. Net written premiums may also be impacted by the structure of reinsurance programs and related costs, as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Overall,
the Company expects retention levels (the amount of expiring premium that renews, before the impact of renewal premium changes) will remain strong by historical standards during
2018. In Business Insurance, the Company expects that domestic renewal premium changes during 2018 will remain positive and will be higher than the levels attained in 2017. In Bond & Specialty
Insurance, the Company expects that renewal premium changes with respect to domestic management liability business during 2018 will remain positive and will be broadly consistent with the levels
attained in 2017. With respect to domestic surety business within Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that net written premium volume during 2018 will be slightly higher than in
2017. In Personal Insurance, the Company expects that domestic Agency Auto renewal premium changes will be positive and broadly consistent with the levels attained in 2017. The Company expects
domestic Agency Auto renewal premium changes will be higher in the first half of 2018 and lower in the second half of 2018 compared with the same periods of 2017. The Company expects that domestic
Agency Homeowners and Other renewal premium changes during 2018 will remain positive and will be slightly higher than the levels attained in 2017. The need for state regulatory approval for changes to
personal property and casualty insurance prices, as well as competitive market conditions, may impact the timing and extent of renewal premium changes. Given the relatively smaller amount of premium
that the Company generates from outside the United States and the transactional nature of some of those markets, particularly Lloyd's, international renewal premium changes in each segment during 2018
could be somewhat higher, broadly consistent with or somewhat lower than the levels attained in 2017.

Property
and casualty insurance market conditions are expected to remain competitive during 2018 for new business. In each of the Company's business segments, new business generally has
less of an impact on underwriting profitability than renewal business, given the volume of new business relative to renewal business. However, in periods of meaningful increases in new business,
despite its positive impact on underwriting gains over time, the impact of higher new business levels may negatively impact the combined ratio for a period of time.

Economic
conditions in the United States and elsewhere could change, due to a variety of factors, including the political and regulatory environment, the U.S. Federal budget and further
potential changes in tax laws in the United States, the repeal, replacement or modification of the Affordable Care Act, the imposition of tariffs or other barriers to international trade, the United
Kingdom's



withdrawal
from the European Union, rapid changes in commodity prices and fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The resulting changes in levels of economic activity could
positively or negatively impact exposure changes at renewal and the Company's ability to write business at acceptable rates. Additionally, changes in levels of economic activity could positively or
negatively impact audit premium adjustments, policy endorsements and mid-term cancellations after policies are written. All of the foregoing, in turn, could positively or negatively impact net written
premiums during 2018, and because earned premiums are a function of net written premiums, earned premiums could be impacted on a lagging basis.

Underwriting Gain/Loss.

The Company's underwriting gain/loss can be significantly impacted by catastrophe losses and net favorable or
unfavorable
prior year reserve development, as well as underlying underwriting margins.

Catastrophe
losses and non-catastrophe weather-related losses are inherently unpredictable from period to period. The Company's results of operations could be adversely impacted if
significant catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather-related losses were to occur.

For
a number of years, the Company's results have included significant amounts of net favorable prior year reserve development driven by better than expected loss experience. However,
given the inherent uncertainty in estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, loss experience could develop such that the Company recognizes higher or lower levels of favorable prior year
reserve development, no favorable prior year reserve development or unfavorable prior year reserve development in future periods. In addition, the ongoing review of prior year claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves, or other changes in current period circumstances, may result in the Company revising current year loss estimates upward or downward in future periods of the current year.

It
is possible that changes in economic conditions could lead to higher inflation than the Company had anticipated, which could in turn lead to an increase in the Company's loss costs
and the need to strengthen claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. These impacts of inflation on loss costs and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves could be more pronounced for those
lines of business that require a relatively longer period of time to finalize and settle claims for a given accident year and, accordingly, are relatively more inflation sensitive. For a further
discussion, see "Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors—If actual claims exceed our claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, or if changes in the estimated
level of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are necessary, including as a result of, among other things, changes in the
legal, regulatory and economic environments in which the Company operates, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected."

In
Business Insurance, the Company expects underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017,
assuming lower (and more normalized) levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses and other loss activity.

In
Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio for the first nine months of 2018 will be broadly
consistent with the same period of 2017, and in the last quarter of 2018, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins will be higher and the underlying combined ratio will be lower than
in the same period of 2017.

In
Personal Insurance, the Company expects underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017. In
Agency Automobile, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio will improve during 2018 compared with 2017, reflecting actions taken to improve
profitability. In Agency Homeowners and Other, the Company expects that underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio in 2018 will be broadly consistent with 2017, assuming lower
(and more normalized) levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses and other loss activity.



Income Taxes.

As a result of the decrease in the corporate federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts
and Jobs Act
(TCJA) in December 2017, the Company's effective tax rate will decline in 2018. The Company expects its 2018 results of operations will benefit from the impact of that rate change. Under current GAAP
reporting guidance, there is potential variability in the Company's effective tax rate due to the manner in which changes in corporate tax rates are reported on items reported in accumulated other
comprehensive income (AOCI), particularly the tax related to unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturity securities. In February 2018, the FASB issued new accounting guidance to address the effects
of the change in tax rates in the TCJA on items reported in AOCI; however, the new guidance is only applicable to changes resulting from the enactment of the TCJA and does not apply to future changes
in tax laws and rates.

Investment Portfolio.

The Company expects to continue to focus its investment strategy on maintaining a high-quality investment
portfolio and a
relatively short average effective duration. The weighted average effective duration of fixed maturities and short-term securities was 4.0 (4.3 excluding short-term securities) at December 31,
2017. From time to time, the Company enters into short positions in U.S. Treasury futures contracts to manage the duration of its fixed maturity portfolio. At December 31, 2017, the Company had
$400 million notional value of open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. The Company continually evaluates its investment alternatives and mix. Currently, the majority of the Company's investments
are comprised of a widely diversified portfolio of high-quality, liquid, taxable U.S. government, tax-exempt U.S. municipal and taxable corporate and U.S. agency mortgage-backed bonds.

The
Company also invests much smaller amounts in equity securities, real estate, private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds, and real estate partnerships and joint ventures. These
investment classes have the potential for higher returns but also the potential for higher degrees of risk, including less stable rates of return and less liquidity.

Net
investment income is a material contributor to the Company's results of operations. Based on the impacts of (i) the lower federal corporate income tax rate in 2018,
(ii) slightly higher levels of fixed maturities and (iii) higher short-term investment yields, partially offset by the impact of (iv) expected lower reinvestment yields on fixed
maturity investments, the Company expects that during 2018, after-tax net investment income from those portfolios will be approximately $25 million to $30 million higher on a quarterly
basis as compared to the corresponding quarters of 2017. The impact of future market conditions on net investment income from the non-fixed maturity investment portfolio during 2018 is hard to
predict. If general economic conditions and/or investment market conditions change during 2018, the Company could experience an increase or decrease in net investment income and/or significant
realized investment gains or losses (including impairments).

The
Company had a net pre-tax unrealized investment gain of $1.38 billion ($1.09 billion after-tax) in its fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017.
While the Company does not attempt to predict future interest rate movements, a rising interest rate environment would reduce the market value of fixed maturity investments and, therefore, reduce
shareholders' equity, and a declining interest rate environment would have the opposite effects. The Company's investment portfolio has benefited from certain tax exemptions (primarily those related
to interest from municipal bonds) and certain other tax laws, including, but not limited to, those governing dividends-received deductions and tax credits (such as foreign tax credits). Changes in
these laws could adversely impact the value of the Company's investment portfolio. See "Changes in U.S. tax laws or in the tax laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely impact
us" included in "Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors."

In
2017, the Company had net pre-tax realized investment gains of $216 million, which were primarily driven by gains on sales of equity securities. Pursuant to updated FASB
guidance and beginning January 1, 2018, the Company's equity securities, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, that have readily determinable fair value will be
measured at fair value



with
changes in fair value recognized as part of net realized investment gains in net income. At December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the Company's equity securities was
$453 million, which included $13 million of net pre-tax unrealized investment gains. The Company currently expects that net pre-tax realized investment gains related to equity securities
in 2018, if any, will be lower than in 2017.

entitled "We are also subject to a number of additional risks associated with our business outside the United States" included in "Part I—Item 1A—Risk Factors"
and see "Part II—Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk."

Capital Position.

The Company believes it has a strong capital position and, as part of its ongoing efforts to create shareholder value,
expects to
continue to return capital not needed to support its business operations to its shareholders. The Company expects that, generally over time, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and
common share repurchases will likely not exceed net income. In addition, the timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of additional factors,
including the Company's financial position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies,
funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including
mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market conditions and other factors. For information regarding the Company's common share repurchases in 2017, see "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

As
a result of the Company's business outside of the United States, primarily in Canada, the United Kingdom (including Lloyd's), the Republic of Ireland and Brazil, the Company's capital
is also subject to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. For example, strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to other currencies could result in a reduction of
shareholders' equity. For additional discussion of the Company's foreign exchange market risk exposure, see "Part II—Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures About Market Risk."

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Liquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of its business operations and to
satisfy general corporate purposes when needed.

Operating Company Liquidity.

The liquidity requirements of the Company's insurance subsidiaries are met primarily by funds generated
from premiums,
fees, income received on investments and investment maturities. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for claims and claim adjustment expense payments and operating expenses. The
insurance subsidiaries' liquidity requirements can be impacted by, among other factors, the timing and amount of catastrophe claims, which are inherently
unpredictable, as well as the timing and amount of reinsurance recoveries, which may be affected by reinsurer solvency and reinsurance coverage disputes. Additionally, the variability of
asbestos-related claim payments, as well as the volatility of potential judgments and settlements arising out of litigation, may also result in increased liquidity requirements. It is the opinion of
the Company's management that the insurance subsidiaries' future liquidity needs will be adequately met from all of the sources described above. Subject to restrictions imposed by states in which the
Company's insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, the Company's principal insurance subsidiaries pay dividends to their respective parent companies, which, in turn, pay dividends to the corporate
holding (parent) company (TRV). For further information regarding restrictions on dividends paid by the Company's insurance subsidiaries, see
"Part I—Item 1—Regulation."

Holding Company Liquidity.

TRV's liquidity requirements primarily include shareholder dividends, debt servicing, common share
repurchases and, from
time to time, contributions to its qualified domestic pension plan. At December 31, 2017, TRV held total cash and short-term invested assets in the United States aggregating
$1.27 billion and having a weighted average maturity of 71 days. TRV has established a holding company liquidity target equal to its estimated annual pre-tax interest expense and common
shareholder dividends (currently approximately $1.1 billion). TRV's holding company liquidity of $1.27 billion at December 31, 2017 exceeded this target and it is the opinion of
the Company's management that these assets are sufficient to meet TRV's current liquidity requirements.

TRV
is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign
operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company's financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2017.

TRV
has a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that expires on June 17, 2019 which permits it to issue securities from time to time. TRV
also has a $1.0 billion line of credit facility with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on June 7, 2018. This line of credit also supports TRV's $800 million
commercial paper program. At December 31, 2017, the Company had $100 million of commercial paper outstanding. TRV is not reliant on its commercial paper program to meet its operating
cash flow needs.

The
Company utilized uncollateralized letters of credit issued by major banks with an aggregate limit of approximately $347 million to provide a portion of the capital needed to
support its obligations at Lloyd's at December 31, 2017. If uncollateralized letters of credit are not available at a reasonable price or at all in the future, the Company can collateralize
these letters of credit or may have to seek alternative means of supporting its obligations at Lloyd's, which could include utilizing holding company funds on hand.

On
August 4, 2017, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings Ltd (Simply Business), a
leading provider of small business insurance policies in the United Kingdom, for a purchase price of approximately $464 million,
which included the repayment of debt and other obligations of Simply Business. In addition, the Company issued 95,953 shares of restricted common stock valued at approximately $12 million to



certain
employees of Simply Business who were equity holders of Simply Business. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in May 2017 (described in more detail
in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements) and internal resources to fund this transaction.

Operating Activities

Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $3.76 billion, $4.20 billion and $3.43 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The decrease in cash flows in 2017 reflected higher levels of payments for claims and claim adjustment expenses, the inclusion in 2016 of proceeds from the settlement of a reinsurance
dispute as discussed in more detail in note 16 of notes to the consolidated financial statements, higher commission expenses and a higher discretionary contribution to the Company's U.S.
qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan, partially offset by higher levels of collected premiums and lower income tax payments. The higher level of payments for claims and claim
adjustment expenses in 2017 included the impact of increased business volumes and a higher level of catastrophe losses, partially offset by the inclusion in 2016 of the Company's $524 million
payment related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc. litigation as described in more detail in the "Asbestos Claims and Litigation" section. The increase in cash flows in 2016
reflected higher levels of collected premiums, proceeds from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute discussed above and lower income tax payments, partially offset by higher levels of payments for
claims and claim adjustment expenses, general and administrative expenses and commission expenses. The higher level of payments for claims and claim adjustment expenses in 2016 included the Company's
$524 million payment related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc. litigation discussed above. Cash flows in 2015 included the Company's $579 million payment related to
the Direct Action Settlements and a lower level of net investment income, partially offset by a higher level of collected premiums and a lower contribution to the Company's qualified domestic pension
plan. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company voluntarily made contributions totaling $300 million, $200 million and $100 million, respectively, to its qualified domestic pension
plan. The qualified domestic pension plan was 108% and 101% funded at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Investing Activities

Net cash used in investing activities was $1.82 billion and $1.46 billion in 2017 and 2016, respectively, compared with net cash
provided by investing activities of $317 million in 2015. The Company's consolidated total investments at December 31, 2017 increased by $2.01 billion, or 3% over year-end 2016,
primarily reflecting the impacts of net cash flows provided by operating activities and an increase in the unrealized appreciation of investments, partially offset by common share repurchases,
dividends paid to shareholders and the cost of acquiring Simply Business. The Company's consolidated total investments at December 31, 2016 increased by $18 million, or less than 1% from
year-end 2015, primarily reflecting net cash flows provided by operating activities, largely offset by common share repurchases, a decrease in the unrealized appreciation of investments and dividends
paid to shareholders.

The
Company's investment portfolio is managed to support its insurance operations; accordingly, the portfolio is positioned to meet obligations to policyholders. As such, the primary
goals of the Company's asset-liability management process are to satisfy the insurance liabilities and maintain sufficient liquidity to cover fluctuations in projected liability cash flows. Generally,
the expected principal and interest payments produced by the Company's fixed maturity portfolio adequately fund the estimated runoff of the Company's insurance reserves. Although this is not an exact
cash flow match in each period, the substantial amount by which the market value of the fixed maturity portfolio exceeds the value of the net insurance liabilities, as well as the positive cash flow
from newly sold



policies
and the large amount of high quality liquid bonds, contributes to the Company's ability to fund claim payments without having to sell illiquid assets or access credit facilities.

Financing Activities

Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1.92 billion, $2.81 billion and $3.73 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. The totals in each year primarily reflected common
share repurchases, dividends paid to shareholders and the payment of debt, partially offset by the issuance of debt and proceeds from employee stock option exercises. Common share repurchases in 2017,
2016 and 2015 were $1.44 billion, $2.47 billion and $3.22 billion, respectively.

Debt Transactions

.

2017.

On May 22, 2017, the Company issued $700 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes that will mature on
May 30, 2047. The net proceeds of the issuance, after the deduction of the underwriting discount and expenses payable by the Company, totaled approximately $689 million. Interest on the
senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 30 and November 30. Prior to November 30, 2046, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's
option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present
values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest to November 30, 2046 on any senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted
to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury rate (as defined in the senior notes), plus 15 basis points.
On or after November 30, 2046, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On
June 2, 2017, the Company redeemed the remaining $107 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2067 at a
price per debenture of 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. On December 15, 2017, the Company's $450 million, 5.75% senior notes
matured and were fully paid.

2016.

On May 11, 2016, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 3.75% senior notes that will mature on
May 15, 2046. The net proceeds of the issuance, after the deduction of underwriting and other expenses, totaled approximately $491 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable
semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15. Prior to November 15, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from
time to time, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of principal and interest on any senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis
(assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate (as defined in the senior notes),
plus 20 basis points. On or after November 15, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price
equal to 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date.

On
June 20, 2016, the Company's $400 million, 6.25% senior notes matured and were fully paid.

2015.

On August 25, 2015, the Company issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 4.30% senior notes that will mature
on
August 25, 2045. The net proceeds of the issuance, after original issuance discount and the deduction of underwriting expenses and commissions and other expenses, totaled approximately
$392 million. Interest on the senior notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on



February 25
and August 25. Prior to February 25, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from time to time, at a
redemption price equal to the greater of (a) 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed or (b) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of
principal and interest on any senior notes to be redeemed (exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption) discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year
consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the then current Treasury Rate (as defined in the senior notes), plus 25 basis points. On or after February 25, 2045, the senior notes may be redeemed, in
whole or in part, at the Company's option, at any time or from time to time, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of any senior notes to be redeemed.

On
December 1, 2015, the Company's $400 million, 5.50% senior notes matured and were fully paid.

Dividends.

Dividends paid to shareholders were $785 million, $757 million and $739 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively.
The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of the Company's common stock will be at the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including the
Company's financial position, earnings, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints and other factors as the Board of Directors deems
relevant. Dividends will be paid by the Company only if declared by its Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to any other restrictions that may be applicable to the Company. On
January 23, 2018, the Company announced that its Board of Directors
declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.72 per share, payable March 30, 2018, to shareholders of record on March 9, 2018.

Share Repurchases.

The Company's Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be
made from time
to time in the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The
authorizations do not have a stated expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial
position, earnings, share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the Company's qualified
pension plan, capital requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related
financings), market conditions and other factors. In April 2017, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization that added an additional $5.0 billion of repurchase capacity.
The following table summarizes repurchase activity in 2017 and remaining repurchase capacity at December 31, 2017.

From
the inception of the first authorization on May 2, 2006 through December 31, 2017, the Company has repurchased a cumulative total of 487.7 million shares for a
total cost of $31.44 billion, or an average of $64.48 per share.



In
2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company acquired 0.5 million, 0.6 million and 0.7 million shares, respectively, of common stock from employees as treasury stock
primarily to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and shares used by employees to cover the price of certain
stock options that were exercised.

Capital Resources

Capital resources reflect the overall financial strength of the Company and its ability to borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new
capital to meet its needs. The following table summarizes the components of the Company's capital structure at December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Total
capitalization at December 31, 2017 was $30.30 billion, $644 million higher than at December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of net income of
$2.06 billion, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income of $412 million due to changes in unrealized appreciation on investments and unrealized foreign currency translation,
proceeds from the exercise of employee share options of $173 million and an increase in debt outstanding of $134 million, partially offset by common share repurchases totaling
$1.38 billion under the Company's share repurchase authorization and shareholder dividends of $789 million.

The
following table provides a reconciliation of total capitalization to total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders'
equity:

The
debt-to-total capital ratio excluding net unrealized gain on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity, is calculated by dividing (a) debt by
(b) total capitalization excluding net unrealized gains and losses on investments, net of taxes, included in shareholders' equity. Net unrealized gains and losses on investments can be
significantly impacted by both interest rate



movements
and other economic factors. Accordingly, in the opinion of the Company's management, the debt-to-total capital ratio calculated on this basis provides another useful metric for investors to
understand the Company's financial leverage position. The Company's ratio of debt-to-total capital excluding after-tax net unrealized investment gains included in shareholders' equity of 22.5% at
December 31, 2017 was within the Company's target range of 15% to 25%.

Credit Agreement.

The Company is a party to a five-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial
institutions
that expires on June 7, 2018. Terms of the credit agreement are discussed in more detail in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Shelf Registration.

The Company has filed a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that
expires on
June 17, 2019 for the potential offering and sale of securities. The Company may offer these securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering.

Share Repurchase Authorization.

At December 31, 2017, the Company had $4.56 billion of capacity remaining under its share
repurchase
authorization approved by the Board of Directors.

Contractual Obligations

The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2017, the Company's future payments under contractual obligations and estimated claims
and claim-related payments. The table excludes short-term obligations and includes only liabilities at December 31, 2017 that are expected to be settled in cash.

The
table below includes the amount and estimated future timing of claims and claim-related payments. The amounts do not represent the exact liability, but instead represent estimates,
generally utilizing actuarial projection techniques, at a given accounting date. These estimates include expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on
the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity, frequency, legal theories of liability and other factors.
Variables in the reserve estimation process can be affected by both internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, economic inflation or deflation, legal trends and
legislative changes. Many of these items are not directly quantifiable, particularly on a prospective basis. Additionally, there may be significant reporting lags between the occurrence of the
policyholder event and the time it is actually reported to the insurer. The future cash flows related to the items contained in the table below required estimation of both amount (including severity
considerations) and timing. Amount and timing are frequently estimated separately. An estimation of both amount and timing of future cash flows related to claims and claim-related payments has
unavoidable estimation uncertainty.



The
contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 were as follows:

The
amounts in "Claims and claim adjustment expenses" in the table above represent the estimated timing of future payments for both reported and unreported claims
incurred and related



claim
adjustment expenses, gross of reinsurance recoverables, excluding structured settlements expected to be paid by annuity companies.

The
Company has entered into reinsurance agreements to manage its exposure to losses and protect its capital as described in note 5 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

In
order to qualify for reinsurance accounting, a reinsurance agreement must indemnify the insurer from insurance risk, i.e., the agreement must transfer amount and timing risk. Since the
timing and amount of cash inflows from such reinsurance agreements are directly related to the underlying payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses by the insurer, reinsurance recoverables are
recognized in a manner consistent with the liabilities (the estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses) relating to the underlying reinsured contracts. The presence of any feature
that can delay timely reimbursement of claims by a reinsurer results in the reinsurance contract being accounted for as a deposit rather than reinsurance. The assumptions used in estimating the amount
and
timing of the reinsurance recoverables are consistent with those used in estimating the amount and timing of the related liabilities.

The
estimated future cash inflows from the Company's reinsurance contracts that qualify for reinsurance accounting are as follows:

For
business underwritten by non-U.S. operations, future cash flows related to reported and unreported claims incurred and related claim adjustment expenses were translated at the spot rate on
December 31, 2017.

The
amounts reported in the table above and in the table of reinsurance recoverables above are presented on a nominal basis and have not been adjusted to reflect the time value of money. Accordingly,
the amounts above will differ from the Company's balance sheet to the extent that the liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses and the related reinsurance recoverables have been discounted
in the balance sheet. See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

(7)

Workers'
compensation large deductible policies provide third-party coverage in which the Company typically is responsible for paying the entire loss under such
policies and then seeks reimbursement from the insured for the deductible amount. "Claims from large deductible policies" represent the estimated future payment for claims and claim related expenses
below the deductible amount, net of the estimated recovery of the deductible. The liability and the related deductible receivable for unpaid claims are presented in the consolidated balance sheet as
"contractholder payables" and "contractholder receivables," respectively. Most deductibles for such policies are paid directly from the policyholder's escrow, which is periodically replenished by the
policyholder. The payment of the loss amounts above the deductible are reported within "Claims and claim adjustment expenses" in the above table. Because the timing of the collection of the deductible
(contractholder receivables) occurs shortly after the payment of the deductible to a claimant (contractholder payables), these cash flows offset each other in the table.



The
estimated timing of the payment of the contractholder payables and the collection of contractholder receivables for workers' compensation policies is presented below:

The
amounts in "Loss-based assessments" relate to estimated future payments of second-injury fund assessments which would result from payment of current claim
liabilities. Second injury funds cover the cost of any additional benefits for aggravation of a pre-existing condition. For loss-based assessments, the cost is shared by the insurance industry and
self-insureds, funded through assessments to insurance companies and self-insureds based on losses. Amounts relating to second-injury fund assessments are included in "other liabilities" in the
consolidated balance sheet.

(9)

The
amounts in "Reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits" represent estimated future nominal payments for reinsurance agreements that are accounted for as
deposits. Amounts payable under deposit agreements are included in "other liabilities" in the consolidated balance sheet.

(10)

The
amounts in "Payout from ceded funds withheld" represent estimated payments for losses and return of funds held related to certain reinsurance arrangements
whereby the Company holds a portion of the premium due to the reinsurer and is allowed to pay claims from the amounts held.

(11)

The
Company's current liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions are $230 million. Offsetting these liabilities are
deferred tax assets of $207 million associated with the temporary differences that would exist if these positions become realized.

The
above table does not include an analysis of liabilities reported for structured settlements for which the Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event
of default by the company issuing the annuity. The Company is not reasonably likely to incur material future payment obligations under such agreements. In addition, the Company is not currently
subject to any minimum funding requirements for its qualified pension plan. Accordingly, future contributions are not included in the foregoing table.

Dividend Availability

The Company's principal insurance subsidiaries are domiciled in the State of Connecticut. The insurance holding company laws of Connecticut
applicable to the Company's subsidiaries requires notice to, and approval by, the state insurance commissioner for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other distributions
made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of 10% of the insurer's statutory capital and surplus as of the preceding December 31, or the insurer's net income for the
twelve-month period ending the preceding December 31, in each case determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices and by state regulation. This declaration or payment is further
limited by adjusted unassigned surplus, as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices. The insurance holding company laws of other states in which the Company's subsidiaries are
domiciled generally contain similar, although in some instances somewhat more restrictive, limitations on the payment of dividends. A maximum of $2.66 billion is available by the end of 2018
for such dividends to the holding company, TRV, without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. The Company may choose to accelerate the timing within 2018 and/or increase the amount
of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2018, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the Connecticut Insurance Department.

In
addition to the regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that can be paid by the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be
paid to the Company's shareholders is limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the Company to
maintain a



minimum
consolidated net worth as described in note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

TRV
is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign
operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company's financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2017.

TRV
and its two non-insurance holding company subsidiaries received dividends of $2.33 billion, $3.05 billion and $3.75 billion from their U.S. insurance
subsidiaries in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the Qualified Plan), which covers substantially all U.S.
domestic employees and provides benefits primarily under a cash balance formula. In addition, the Company sponsors a nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain highly-compensated
employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for
certain retirees.

The
Qualified Plan is subject to regulations under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 as amended (ERISA), which requires plans to meet minimum standards of funding and
requires such plans to subscribe to plan termination insurance through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). The Company does not have a minimum funding requirement for the Qualified Plan
for 2018 and does not anticipate having a minimum funding requirement in 2019. The Company has significant discretion in making contributions above those necessary to satisfy the minimum funding
requirements. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, there was no minimum funding requirement for the Qualified Plan. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company voluntarily made contributions totaling $300 million,
$200 million and $100 million, respectively, to the Qualified Plan. Based on its funded status at December 31, 2017, the Company does not currently anticipate making a voluntary
contribution to the Qualified Plan in 2018. In determining future contributions, the Company will consider the performance of the plan's investment portfolio, the effects of interest rates on the
projected benefit obligation of the plan and the Company's other capital requirements.

In
2016, the Company began using a full yield-curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and
nonqualified domestic pension plans and its domestic postretirement benefit plans. For a full discussion of the rationale and impact of this change in approach, see note 14 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements.

The
Qualified Plan assets are managed to maximize long-term total return while maintaining an appropriate level of risk. The Company's overall strategy is to achieve a mix of
approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current target
allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40% fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. For 2018, the Company plans to apply an
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 7.00%, the same rate that was applied in 2017. The expected rate of return reflects the Company's current expectations with regard to long-term
returns in the capital markets, taking into account the pension plan's asset allocation targets, the historical performance and current valuation of U.S. and international equities, and the level of
long term interest rate and inflation expectations. The Company's expected long-term rate of return on plan assets also contemplates a return to more normal levels of long-term interest rates in the
future.



For further discussion of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans, see note 14 of notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Risk-Based Capital

The NAIC has an RBC requirement for most property and casualty insurance companies, which determines minimum capital requirements and is
intended to raise the level of protection for policyholder obligations. The Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to these NAIC RBC requirements based on laws that have been adopted by
individual states. These requirements subject insurers having policyholders' surplus less than that required by the RBC calculation to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of
capital inadequacy. Each of the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries had policyholders' surplus at December 31, 2017 significantly above the level at which any RBC regulatory action would
occur. Regulators in the
jurisdictions in which the Company's foreign insurance subsidiaries are located require insurance companies to maintain certain levels of capital depending on, among other things, the type and amount
of insurance policies in force. Each of the Company's foreign insurance subsidiaries had capital significantly above their respective regulatory requirements at December 31, 2017.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

The Company has entered into certain contingent obligations for guarantees related to selling businesses to third parties, certain investments,
third-party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications. See note 16 of notes to the
consolidated financial statements. The Company does not expect these arrangements will have a material effect on the Company's financial position, changes in financial position, revenues and expenses,
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

The Company considers its most significant accounting estimates to be those applied to claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and related
reinsurance recoverables, investment valuation and impairments, and goodwill and other intangible assets impairments.

The
$1.70 billion increase in gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves since December 31, 2016 primarily reflected the impacts of (i) catastrophe losses
incurred in the second half of 2017 and (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures and loss cost trends for the current accident year, partially offset by the impacts of (iii) payments
related to operations in runoff and (iv) net favorable prior year reserve development.

Asbestos
and environmental reserves are included in the General liability, Commercial multi-peril and International and other lines in the foregoing summary table. Asbestos and
environmental reserves are discussed separately; see "Asbestos Claims and Litigation", "Environmental Claims and Litigation" and "Uncertainty Regarding Adequacy of Asbestos and Environmental
Reserves."

Claims
and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for claims that have been reported
and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported (IBNR) as of the balance sheet date. Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability, but
instead represent management estimates, primarily utilizing actuarial expertise and projection methods. These estimates are expectations of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims
will cost upon final resolution in the future, based on the Company's assessment of facts and circumstances then known, review of historical settlement patterns, estimates of trends in claims severity
and frequency, expected interpretations of legal theories of liability and other factors. In establishing gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, the Company also considers salvage and
subrogation. Estimated recoveries from reinsurance are included in "Reinsurance Recoverables" as an asset on the Company's consolidated balance sheet. The claims and claim adjustment expense reserves
are reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company.

The
process of estimating claims and claim adjustment expense reserves involves a high degree of judgment and is subject to a number of variables. These variables can be affected by both
internal and external events, such as changes in claims handling procedures, changes in individuals involved in the reserve estimation process, economic inflation, legal trends and legislative
changes, among others. The impact of many of these items on ultimate costs for claims and claim adjustment expenses is difficult to estimate. Estimation difficulties also differ significantly by
product line due to differences in claim complexity, the volume of claims, the potential severity of individual claims, the determination of occurrence date for a claim and reporting lags (the time
between the occurrence of the policyholder event and when it is actually reported to the insurer). Informed judgment is applied throughout the process, including the application of various individual
experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. The Company continually refines its estimates in a regular ongoing process as
historical loss experience develops and additional claims are reported and settled. The Company rigorously attempts to consider all significant facts and circumstances known at the time claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves are established. Due to the inherent uncertainty underlying these estimates including, but not limited to, the future settlement environment, final resolution of the
estimated liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses may be higher or lower than the related claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at the reporting date. Therefore, actual paid losses,
as claims are settled in the future, may be materially different than the amount currently recorded—favorable or unfavorable.

Because
establishment of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, currently established claims and claim adjustment expense
reserves may change. The Company reflects adjustments to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.

There
are also additional risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes, tornadoes and other
catastrophic events can be affected by the inability of the Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas,



the
complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties, including the interpretation of policy terms and conditions, and the nature of the information available
to establish the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution exposures;
estimating additional living expenses; estimating the impact of demand surge, infrastructure disruption, fraud, the effect of mold damage and business interruption costs; and reinsurance
collectibility. The timing of a catastrophe, such as at or near the end of a reporting period, can also affect the information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting
period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.

A
portion of the Company's gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves (totaling $1.91 billion at December 31, 2017) are for asbestos and environmental claims and
related litigation. While the ongoing review of asbestos and environmental claims and associated liabilities considers the inconsistencies of court decisions as to coverage, plaintiffs' expanded
theories of liability and the risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, in the opinion of the Company's management, it is possible that the outcome of the continued uncertainties
regarding these claims could result in liability in future periods that differs from current insurance reserves by an amount that could be material to the Company's future operating results. See the
preceding discussion of "Asbestos Claims and Litigation" and "Environmental Claims and Litigation."

General Discussion

The process for estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses begins with the collection and analysis of claim data. Data
on individual reported claims, both current and historical, including paid amounts and individual claim adjuster estimates, are grouped by common characteristics (components) and evaluated by
actuaries in their analyses of ultimate claim liabilities. Such data is occasionally supplemented with external data as available and when appropriate. The process of analyzing reserves for a
component is undertaken on a regular basis, generally quarterly, in light of continually updated information.

Multiple
estimation methods are available for the analysis of ultimate claim liabilities. Each estimation method has its own set of assumption variables and its own advantages and
disadvantages, with no single estimation method being better than the others in all situations and no one set of assumption variables being meaningful for all product line components. The relative
strengths and weaknesses of the particular estimation methods when applied to a particular group of claims can also change over time. Therefore, the actual choice of estimation method(s) can change
with each evaluation. The estimation method(s) chosen are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication at that particular evaluation date for the claim liabilities being evaluated.

In
most cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim liabilities being evaluated. This will result in a range of reasonable
estimates for any particular claim liability. The Company uses such range analyses to back test whether previously established estimates for reserves by reporting segments are reasonable, given
available information. Reported values found to be closer to the endpoints of a range of reasonable estimates are subject to further detailed reviews. These reviews may substantiate the validity of
management's recorded estimate or lead to a change in the reported estimate.

The
exact boundary points of these ranges are more qualitative than quantitative in nature, as no clear line of demarcation exists to determine when the set of underlying assumptions for
an estimation method switches from being reasonable to unreasonable. As a result, the Company does not believe that the endpoints of these ranges are or would be comparable across companies. In
addition, potential interactions among the different estimation assumptions for different product lines make the aggregation of individual ranges a highly judgmental and inexact process.



Property-casualty
insurance policies are either written on a "claims-made" or on an "occurrence" basis. Claims-made policies generally cover, subject to requirements in individual
policies, claims reported during the policy period. Policies that are written on an occurrence basis require that the insured demonstrate that a loss occurred in the policy period, even if the insured
reports the loss many years later.

Most
general liability policies are written on an occurrence basis. These policies are subject to substantial loss development over time as facts and circumstances change in the years
following the policy issuance. The occurrence form, which accounts for much of the reserve development in asbestos and environmental exposures, is also used to provide coverage for construction
general liability, including construction defect. Occurrence-based forms of insurance for general liability exposures require substantial projection of loss trends, which can be influenced by a number
of factors, including future inflation, judicial interpretations and societal litigation trends (e.g., size of jury awards and propensity of individuals to pursue litigation), among others.

A
basic premise in most actuarial analyses is that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future, absent a material change in the associated risk factors
discussed below. To the extent a material change affecting the ultimate claim liability is known, such change is estimated to the extent possible through an analysis of internal company data and, if
available and when appropriate, external data. Such a measurement is specific to the facts and circumstances of the particular claim portfolio and the known change being evaluated. Significant
structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can materially impact the reserve estimation process. In addition, the introduction of new products creates a unique risk as
historical company data would typically not be available.

Informed
judgment is applied throughout the reserving process. This includes the application of various individual experiences and expertise to multiple sets of data and analyses. In
addition to actuaries, experts involved with the reserving process also include underwriting and claims personnel and lawyers, as well as other company management. Therefore, management may have to
consider varying individual viewpoints as part of its estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves. It is also likely that during periods of significant change, such as a merger,
consistent application of informed judgment becomes even more complicated and difficult.

The
variables discussed above in this general discussion have different impacts on reserve estimation uncertainty for a given product line, depending on the length of the claim tail, the
reporting lag, the impact of individual claims and the complexity of the claim process for a given product line.

Product
lines are generally classifiable as either long tail or short tail, based on the average length of time between the event triggering claims under a policy and the final
resolution of those claims. Short tail claims are reported and settled quickly, resulting in less estimation variability. The longer the time to final claim resolution, the greater the exposure to
estimation risks and hence the greater the estimation uncertainty.

A
major component of the claim tail is the reporting lag. The reporting lag, which is the time between the event triggering a claim and the reporting of the claim to the insurer, makes
estimating IBNR inherently more uncertain. In addition, the greater the reporting lag, the greater the proportion of IBNR to the total claim liability for the product line. Writing new products with
material reporting lags can result in adding several years' worth of IBNR claim exposure before the reporting lag exposure becomes clearly observable, thereby increasing the risk associated with
estimating the liabilities for claims and claim adjustment expenses for such products. The most extreme example of claim liabilities with long reporting lags are asbestos claims.

For
some lines, the impact of large individual claims can be material to the analysis. These lines are generally referred to as being "low frequency/high severity," while lines without
this "large claim"



sensitivity
are referred to as "high frequency/low severity." Estimates of claim liabilities for low frequency/high severity lines can be sensitive to the impact of a small number of potentially large
claims. As a result, the role of judgment is much greater for these reserve estimates. In contrast, for high frequency/low severity lines the impact of individual claims is relatively minor and the
range of reasonable reserve estimates is likely narrower and more stable.

Claim
complexity can also greatly affect the estimation process by impacting the number of assumptions needed to produce the estimate, the potential stability of the underlying data and
claim process, and the ability to gain an understanding of the data. Product lines with greater claim complexity, such as for certain surety and construction exposures, have inherently greater
estimation uncertainty.

Actuaries
have to exercise a considerable degree of judgment in the evaluation of all these factors in their analysis of reserves. The human element in the application of actuarial
judgment is unavoidable when faced with material uncertainty. Different actuaries may choose different assumptions when faced with such uncertainty, based on their individual backgrounds, professional
experiences and areas of focus. Hence, the estimates selected by the various actuaries may differ materially from each other.

Lastly,
significant structural changes to the available data, product mix or organization can also materially impact the reserve estimation process. Events such as mergers increase the
inherent uncertainty of reserve estimates for a period of time, until stable trends re-establish themselves within the new organization.

Risk Factors

The major causes of material uncertainty ("risk factors") generally will vary for each product line, as well as for each separately analyzed
component of the product line. In a few cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method, but in most cases, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume
that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged. Actual results will likely vary
from expectations for each of these assumptions, causing actual paid losses, as claims are settled in the future, to be different in amount than the reserves being estimated currently.

Some
risk factors will affect more than one product line. Examples include changes in claim department practices, changes in settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions,
court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants and degree of claimant fraud. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a product line.
Individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within product line components.

The
effect of a particular risk factor on estimates of claim liabilities cannot be isolated in most cases. For example, estimates of potential claim settlements may be impacted by the
risk associated with potential court rulings, but the final settlement agreement typically does not delineate how much of the settled amount is due to this and other factors.

The
evaluation of data is also subject to distortion from extreme events or structural shifts, sometimes in unanticipated ways. For example, the timing of claims payments in one
geographic region may be impacted if claim adjusters are temporarily reassigned from that region to help settle catastrophe claims in another region.

While
some changes in the claim environment are sudden in nature (such as a new court ruling affecting the interpretation of all contracts in that jurisdiction), others are more
evolutionary. Evolutionary changes can occur when multiple factors affect final claim values, with the uncertainty surrounding each factor being resolved separately, in stepwise fashion. The final
impact is not known until all steps have occurred.



Sudden changes generally cause a one-time shift in claim liability estimates, although there may be some lag in reliable quantification of their impact.
Evolutionary changes generally cause a series of shifts in claim liability estimates, as each component of the evolutionary change becomes evident and estimable.

Actuarial Methods for Analyzing and Estimating Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense
Reserves

The principal estimation and analysis methods utilized by the Company's actuaries to evaluate management's existing estimates for prior accident
periods are the paid loss development method, the case incurred development method, the Bornhuetter-Ferguson (BF) method, and average value analysis combined with the reported claim development
method. The BF method is usually utilized for more recent accident periods, with a transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible. These
estimation and analysis methods
are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods. (See note 7 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of these methods).

While
the Company utilizes these conventional actuarial methods to estimate the claims liability for its various businesses, Company actuaries evaluating a particular component for a
product line may select from the full range of methods developed within the casualty actuarial profession. The Company's actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession
for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future estimates.

Some
components of a product line may be susceptible to infrequent large claims or not be subject to conventional methods. In such cases, the Company's actuarial analysis will isolate
such components for review. The reserves excluding such large claims are generally analyzed using the conventional methods described above. The reserves associated with large claims are then analyzed
utilizing various methods, such as:

•

Estimating the number of large claims and their average values based on historical trends from prior accident periods, adjusted for the current
environment and supplemented with actual data for the accident year analyzed to the extent available.

•

Utilizing individual claim adjuster estimates of the large claims, combined with continual monitoring of the aggregate accuracy of such claim
adjuster estimates. (This monitoring may lead to supplemental adjustments to the aggregate of such claim estimates).

•

Utilizing historic longer-term average ratios of large claims to small claims, and applying such ratios to the estimated ultimate small claims
from conventional analysis.

•

Ground-up analysis of the underlying exposure (typically used for asbestos and environmental).

The
results of such methodologies are subjected to various reasonability and diagnostic tests, including implied incurred-loss-to-earned-premium ratios, non-zero claim severity trends
and paid-to-incurred loss ratios. An actual versus expected analysis is also performed comparing actual loss development to expected development embedded within management's best estimate. Additional
analyses may be performed based on the results of these diagnostics, including the investigation of other actuarial methods.

The
methods described above are generally utilized to evaluate management's estimate for prior accident periods. For the initial estimate of the current accident year, however, the
available claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication. As a result, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on an exposure-based method using either the
loss ratio projection method or the expected loss method. The loss ratio projection method, which is typically used for guaranteed-cost business, develops an initial estimate for an accident year by
multiplying earned premiums for the accident year by a projected loss ratio. The projected loss ratio is determined by analyzing prior period



experience,
and adjusting for loss cost trends, rate level differences, mix of business changes and other known or observed factors influencing the current accident year relative to prior accident
years. The exact number of prior accident years utilized varies by product line component, based on the stability and consistency of the individual accident year estimates. The expected loss method,
which is typically used for loss sensitive business, develops an initial estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year by analyzing exposures by account.

Management's Estimates

At least once per quarter, certain members of Company management meet with the Company's actuaries to review the latest claims and claim
adjustment expense reserve analyses. Based on these analyses, management determines whether its ultimate claim liability estimates should be changed. In doing so, it must evaluate whether the new data
provided represents credible actionable information or an anomaly that will have no effect on estimated ultimate claim liability. For example, as described above, payments may have decreased in one
geographic region due to fewer claim adjusters being available to process claims. The resulting claim payment patterns would be analyzed to determine whether or not the change in payment pattern
represents a change in ultimate claim liability.

Such
an assessment requires considerable judgment. It is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until sometime after the event. Even if a change
is determined to be permanent, it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until sometime later. The overall detailed analyses supporting such an effort can take several
months to perform as the underlying causes of the trends observed need to be evaluated, which may require the gathering or assembling of data not previously available. It may also include interviews
with experts involved with the underlying processes. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the Company's
estimated claim liabilities. The final estimate selected by management in a reporting period is based on these various detailed analyses of past data, adjusted to reflect any new actionable
information.

The
Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the process by which the Company establishes reserves for the purpose of the Company's financial statements.

Discussion of Product Lines

The following section details reserving considerations and common risk factors by product line. There are many additional risk factors that may
impact ultimate claim costs. Each risk factor presented will have a different impact on required reserves. Also, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves. For
example, in workers' compensation, the use of expensive medical procedures that result in medical cost inflation may enable workers to return to work faster, thereby lowering indemnity costs. Thus, in
almost all cases, it is impossible to discretely measure the effect of a single risk factor and construct a meaningful sensitivity expectation.

In
order to provide information on reasonably possible reserving changes by product line, the historical changes in year-end claims and claim adjustment expense reserves over a one-year
period are provided for the U.S. product lines. This information is provided for both the Company and the industry for the nine most recent years, and is based on the most recent publicly available
data for the reported line(s) that most closely match the individual product line being discussed. These changes were calculated, net of reinsurance, from statutory annual statement data found in
Schedule P of those statements, and represent the reported reserve development on the beginning-of-the-year claim liabilities divided by the beginning claim liabilities, all accident years
combined, excluding non-defense related claim adjustment expense. Data presented for the Company includes history for the entire Travelers group (U.S. companies only), as required by the statutory
reporting instructions promulgated by state regulatory authorities for Schedule P. Comparable data for non-U.S. companies is not available.



General Liability

General liability is generally considered a long tail line, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize and settle claims from a
given accident year. The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the characteristics of claims, including specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction and specific policy
provisions such as self-insured retentions, among others. There are numerous components underlying the general liability product line. Some of these have relatively moderate payment patterns (with
most of the claims for a given accident year closed within five to seven years), while others can have extreme lags in both reporting and payment of claims (e.g., a reporting lag of a decade or
more for "construction defect" claims).

While
the majority of general liability coverages are written on an "occurrence" basis, certain general liability coverages (such as those covering management and professional liability,
including cyber coverages) are typically insured on a "claims-made" basis.

General
liability reserves are generally analyzed as two components: primary and excess/umbrella, with the primary component generally analyzed separately for bodily injury and property
damage. Bodily injury liability payments reimburse the claimant for damages pertaining to physical injury as a result of the policyholder's legal obligation arising from non-intentional acts such as
negligence, subject to the insurance policy provisions. In some cases the damages can include future wage loss (which is a function of future earnings power and wage inflation) and future medical
treatment costs. Property damage liability payments result from damages to the claimant's private property arising from the policyholder's legal obligation for non-intentional acts. In most cases,
property damage losses are a function of costs as of the loss date, or soon thereafter.

In
addition, sizable or unique exposures are reviewed separately. These exposures include asbestos, environmental, other mass torts, construction defect and large unique accounts that
would otherwise distort the analysis. These unique categories often require a very high degree of judgment and require reserve analyses that do not rely on conventional actuarial methods.

Defense
costs are also a part of the insured costs covered by liability policies and can be significant, sometimes greater than the cost of the actual paid claims. For some products this
risk is mitigated by policy language such that the insured portion of defense costs is included in the policy limit available to pay the claim. Such "defense within the limits" policies are most
common for "claims-made" products. When defense costs are outside of the policy limits, the full amount of the policy limit is available to pay claims and the amounts paid for defense costs have no
contractual limit.

This
line is typically the largest source of reserve estimate uncertainty in the United States (excluding assumed reinsurance contracts covering the same risk). Major contributors to
this reserve estimate uncertainty include the reporting lag (i.e., the length of time between the event triggering coverage and the actual reporting of the claim), the number of parties
involved in the underlying tort action, whether the "event" triggering coverage is confined to only one time period or is spread over multiple time periods, the potential dollars involved (in the
individual claim actions), whether such claims were reasonably foreseeable and intended to be covered at the time the contracts were written (i.e., coverage dispute potential), and the
potential for mass claim actions. Claims with longer reporting lags result in greater estimation uncertainty. This is especially true for alleged claims with a latency feature, particularly where
courts have ruled that coverage is spread over multiple policy years, hence involving multiple defendants (and their insurers and reinsurers) and multiple policies (thereby increasing the potential
dollars involved and the underlying settlement complexity). Claims with long latencies also increase the potential recognition lag (i.e., the lag between writing a type of policy in a certain
market and the recognition that such policies have potential mass tort and/or latent claim exposure).



The
amount of reserve estimate uncertainty also varies significantly by component for the general liability product line. The components in this product line with the longest latency,
longest reporting lags, largest potential dollars involved and greatest claim settlement complexity are asbestos and environmental. Components that include latency, reporting lag and/or complexity
issues, but to a materially lesser extent than asbestos and environmental, include construction defect and other mass tort actions. Many components of general liability are not subject to material
latency or claim complexity risks and hence have materially less uncertainty than the previously mentioned components. In general, components with shorter reporting lags, fewer parties involved in
settlement negotiations, only one policy potentially triggered per claim, fewer potential settlement dollars, reasonably foreseeable (and stable) potential hazards/claims and no mass tort potential
result in much less reserve estimate uncertainty than components without those characteristics.

In
addition to the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion section, the company utilizes various report year development and S-curve methods for the
construction defect components of this product line. The Construction Defect report year development analysis is supplemented with projected claim counts and average values for IBNR claim counts. For
components with greater lags in claim reporting, such as excess and umbrella components of this product line, the company relies more heavily on the BF method than on the paid and case incurred
development methods.

Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required general liability reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:

General liability risk factors

•

Changes in claim handling philosophies

•

Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provisions

•

New or expanded theories of liability

•

Trends in jury awards

•

Changes in the propensity to sue, in general with specificity to particular issues

•

Changes in the propensity to litigate rather than settle a claim

•

Changes in statutes of limitations

•

Changes in the underlying court system

•

Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues

•

Changes in tort law

•

Shifts in lawsuit mix between federal and state courts

•

Changes in claim adjuster processes or reporting which may cause distortions in the data being analyzed

•

The potential impact of inflation on loss costs

•

Changes in settlement patterns

General liability book of business risk factors

•

Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)

•

Changes in underwriting standards



•

Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix)

Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for general liability
(excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.5% increase (decrease) in claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves.

Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from
–8% to –3% (averaging –4%) for the Company, and from –5% to 0% (averaging –3%) for the industry overall. The Company's
year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year
changes in reserve estimates for this product line. General liability reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 20% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment
expense reserves.

The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, was –4% for 2017, –4% for 2016 and
–3% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2009 through 2016. The 2016
change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for both primary and excess coverages for accident years 2015 and prior. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss
experience for excess coverages for accident years 2005 through 2013.

Commercial Property

Commercial property is generally considered a short tail line with a simpler and faster claim reporting and adjustment process than liability
coverages, and less uncertainty in the reserve setting process (except for more complex business interruption claims). It is generally viewed as a moderate frequency, low to moderate severity line,
except for catastrophes and coverage related to large properties. The claim reporting and settlement process for property coverage claim reserves is generally restricted to the insured and the
insurer. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a low estimation risk, except possibly for catastrophes and business interruption claims.

Commercial
property reserves are typically analyzed in two components, one for catastrophic or other large single events, and another for all other events. Examples of common risk
factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required property reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section) include:

Commercial property risk factors

•

Physical concentration of policyholders

•

Availability and cost of local contractors

•

For the more severe catastrophic events, "demand surge" inflation, which refers to significant short-term increases in building material and
labor costs due to a sharp increase in demand for those materials and services

•

Local building codes

•

Amount of time to return property to full usage (for business interruption claims)

•

Frequency of claim re-openings on claims previously closed

•

Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding)



•

Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment
on roofs)

•

Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations

Commercial property book of business risk factors

•

Policy provisions mix (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements)

•

Changes in underwriting standards

Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for property, a 1%
increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from –25% to –5% (averaging
–15%) for the Company, and from –14% to –5% (averaging –8%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by,
and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this
product line. Commercial property reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Since
commercial property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year change for commercial property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due
to the fact that the majority of the reserve for commercial property relates to the most recent accident year, which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year
uncertainty is relevant to commercial property because of weather-related events which, notwithstanding 2013 through 2016 experience, tend to be concentrated in the second half of the year, and
generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes may take even longer to resolve. The reserve estimates for this product line are
also potentially subject to material changes due to uncertainty in measuring ultimate losses for significant catastrophes such as the events of September 11, 2001, Hurricane Katrina and Storm
Sandy.

The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was –9% for 2017, –9% for 2016 and –21% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily
reflected better than expected loss experience related to non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2015 and 2016. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related to
non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2014 and 2015. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience related to catastrophe losses for accident years 2011, 2012 and 2014,
and non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2013 and 2014.

Commercial Multi-Peril

Commercial multi-peril provides a combination of property and liability coverage typically for small businesses and, therefore, includes both
short and long tail coverages. For property coverage, it generally takes a relatively short period of time to close claims, while for the other coverages, generally for the liability coverages, it
takes a longer period of time to close claims.

The
reserving risk for this line is dominated by the liability coverage portion of this product, except occasionally in the event of catastrophic or other large single loss events. The
reserving risk for this line differs from that of the general liability product line and the property product line due to the nature of the customer. Commercial multi-peril is generally sold to small-
to mid-sized accounts, while the customer profile for general liability and commercial property includes larger customers.



See
"Commercial property risk factors" and "General liability risk factors," discussed above, with regard to reserving risk for commercial multi-peril.

Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial
multi-peril (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves.

Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line, excluding estimated asbestos and environmental amounts, over the last nine years has varied from
–9% to 5% (averaging 0%) for the Company, and from –6% to 1% (averaging –2%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by,
and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this
product line. Commercial multi-peril reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental reserves) represent approximately 8% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

As
discussed above, this line combines general liability and commercial property coverages and it has been impacted in the past by many of the same events as those two lines.

The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was –5% for 2017, 1% for 2016 and –1% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected better
than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2016 and prior. The 2016 change primarily reflected worse than expected loss experience for property coverages related to
non-catastrophe losses for accident year 2015. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for property coverages related to non-catastrophe losses for accident years 2012
and 2014.

Commercial Automobile

The commercial automobile product line is a mix of property and liability coverages and, therefore, includes both short and long tail coverages.
The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage (property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult
to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. In general, claim reporting lags are generally short, claim complexity is not a major issue, and the line is viewed as high frequency, low to moderate
severity. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.

Commercial
automobile reserves are typically analyzed in four components: bodily injury liability; property damage liability; collision claims; and comprehensive claims. These last two
components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate risk factors are not presented.

The
Company utilizes the conventional actuarial methods mentioned in the general discussion above in estimating claim liabilities for this line. This is supplemented with detailed custom
analyses where needed.

Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required commercial automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:

•

Trends in jury awards

•

Changes in the underlying court system



•

Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, etc.)

•

Changes in mix of insured vehicles (e.g., long haul trucks versus local and smaller vehicles, fleet risks versus non-fleets)

•

Changes in underwriting standards

Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for commercial
automobile, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from –6% to 7% (averaging 1%) for the Company, and
from –3% to 7% (averaging 1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that
its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Commercial automobile reserves represent approximately 7% of the
Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 4% for 2017, –1% for 2016 and 0% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily reflected worse than expected loss
experience for liability coverages for accident years 2013 through 2016. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2011 and prior.

Workers' Compensation

Workers' compensation is generally considered a long tail coverage, as it takes a relatively long period of time to finalize claims from a given
accident year. While certain payments such as initial medical treatment or temporary wage replacement for the injured worker are made quickly, some other payments are made over the course of several
years, such as awards for permanent partial injuries. In addition, some payments can run as long as the injured worker's life, such as permanent disability



benefits
and on-going medical care. Despite the possibility of long payment tails, the reporting lags are generally short, payment obligations are generally not complex, and most of the liability can
be considered high frequency with moderate severity. The largest reserve risk generally comes from the low frequency, high severity claims providing lifetime coverage for medical expense arising from
a worker's injury, as such claims are subject to greater inflation risk. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a somewhat greater than moderate estimation risk.

Workers'
compensation reserves are typically analyzed in three components: indemnity losses, medical losses and claim adjustment expenses.

Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required workers' compensation reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:

Indemnity risk factors

•

Time required to recover from the injury

•

Degree of available transitional jobs

•

Degree of legal involvement

•

Changes in the interpretations and processes of the administrative bodies that oversee workers' compensation claims

•

Future wage inflation for states that index benefits

•

Changes in the administrative policies of second injury funds

Medical risk factors

•

Changes in the cost of medical treatments (including prescription drugs) and underlying fee schedules ("inflation")

•

Frequency of visits to health providers

•

Number of medical procedures given during visits to health providers

•

Types of health providers used

•

Type of medical treatments received

•

Use of preferred provider networks and other medical cost containment practices

•

Availability of new medical processes and equipment

•

Changes in the use of pharmaceutical drugs, including drugs for pain management

•

Degree of patient responsiveness to treatment

General workers' compensation risk factors

•

Frequency of reopening claims previously closed

•

Mortality trends of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatment

•

Changes in statutory benefits

•

Degree of cost shifting between workers' compensation and health insurance, including Medicare, and the impact, if any, of the Affordable Care
Act

Changes in underwriting standards

Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for workers'
compensation, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from –3% to 0% (averaging –1%)
for the Company, and from –2% to 1% (averaging –1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events
during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Workers' compensation
reserves represent approximately 39% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was –3% for 2017, –2% for 2016 and –1% for 2015. The 2017 change primarily
reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2016 and prior. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2006 and prior as well as
accident years 2009, 2013 and 2015. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for accident years 2006 and prior.

Fidelity and Surety

Fidelity is generally considered a short tail coverage. It takes a relatively short period of time to finalize and settle most fidelity claims.
The volatility of fidelity reserves is generally related to the type of business of the insured, the size and complexity of the insured's business operations, amount of policy limit and attachment
point of coverage. The uncertainty surrounding reserves for small, commercial insureds is typically less than the uncertainty for large commercial or financial institutions. The high frequency, low
severity nature of small commercial fidelity losses provides for stability in loss estimates, whereas the low frequency, high severity nature of losses for large insureds results in a wider range of
ultimate loss outcomes. Actuarial techniques that rely on a stable pattern of loss development are generally not applicable to low frequency, high severity claims.

Surety
has certain components that are generally considered short tail coverages with short reporting lags, although large individual construction and commercial surety contracts can
result in a long settlement tail, based on the length and complexity of the construction project(s) or commercial transaction being insured. The frequency of losses in surety generally correlates with
economic cycles as the primary cause of surety loss is the inability of an insured to fulfill its contractual obligations. The Company actively seeks to mitigate this exposure to loss through
disciplined risk selection, adherence to underwriting standards and ongoing monitoring of contractor progress in significant construction projects. The volatility of surety losses is generally related
to the type of business performed by the insured, the type of bonded obligation, the amount of limit exposed to loss and the amount of assets available to the insurer to mitigate losses, such as
unbilled contract funds, collateral, first and third party indemnity, and other security positions of an insured's assets. Certain classes of surety claims are very high severity, low frequency in
nature. These can include large construction contractors involved with one or multiple large, complex projects as well as certain large commercial surety exposures. Other claim factors affecting
reserve variability of surety include litigation related to amounts owed by and due the insured (e.g., salvage and subrogation efforts) and the results of financial restructuring of an insured.



Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required fidelity and surety reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion
section) include:

•

Type of business of insured

•

Policy limit and attachment points

•

Third-party claims

•

Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for fidelity and surety,
a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.3% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from –36% to –6%
(averaging –18%) for the Company, and from –17% to –2% (averaging –10%) for the industry overall. The Company's
year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year
changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Fidelity and surety reserves represent approximately 1% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

In
general, developments on single large claims (both adverse and favorable) are a primary source of changes in reserve estimates for this product line.

The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was –10% for 2017, –36% for 2016 and –30% for 2015. The 2017 change
primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in



the
fidelity and surety product line for accident years 2014 and 2015. The 2016 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident
years 2009 through 2015. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience in the fidelity and surety product line for accident years 2008 through 2014, which was partially
driven by a reduction in outstanding exposures related to the financial crisis that commenced in 2007.

Personal Automobile

Personal automobile includes both short and long tail coverages. The payments that are made quickly typically pertain to auto physical damage
(property) claims and property damage (liability) claims. The payments that take longer to finalize and are more difficult to estimate relate to bodily injury claims. Reporting lags are relatively
short and the claim settlement process for personal automobile liability generally is the least complex of the liability products. It is generally viewed as a high frequency, low to moderate severity
product line. Overall, the claim liabilities for this line create a moderate estimation risk.

Personal
automobile reserves are typically analyzed in five components: bodily injury liability, property damage liability, no-fault losses, collision claims and comprehensive claims.
These last two components have minimum reserve risk and fast payouts and, accordingly, separate factors are not presented.

Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required personal automobile reserves (beyond those included in the general reserve
discussion section) include:

Bodily injury, property damage liability and no-fault risk factors

•

Trends in jury awards

•

Changes in the underlying court system and its philosophy

•

Changes in case law

Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for personal automobile,
a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line over the last nine years has varied from –4% to 3% (averaging 1%) for the Company,
and from –3% to 2% (averaging –1%) for the industry overall. The Company's year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year.
The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Personal automobile reserves represent
approximately 7% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line was 0% for 2017, 3% for 2016 and –4% for 2015. The 2016 change primarily reflected worse than
expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident year 2015. The change for 2015 primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2012
through 2014.

Homeowners and Personal Lines Other

Homeowners is generally considered a short tail coverage. Most payments are related to the property portion of the policy, where the claim
reporting and settlement process is generally restricted to the insured and the insurer. Claims on property coverage are typically reported soon after the actual damage occurs, although delays of
several months are not unusual. The resulting settlement process is typically fairly short term, although exceptions do exist.

The
liability portion of the homeowners policy generates claims which take longer to pay due to the involvement of litigation and negotiation, but with generally small reporting lags.
Personal Lines Other products include personal umbrella policies, among others. See "general liability reserving risk factors," discussed above, for reserving risk factors related to umbrella
coverages.

Overall,
the line is generally high frequency, low to moderate severity (except for catastrophes), with simple to moderate claim complexity.

Homeowners
reserves are typically analyzed in two components: non-catastrophe related losses and catastrophe loss payments.

Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required homeowners reserves (beyond those included in the general discussion section)
include:

Non-catastrophe risk factors

•

Salvage opportunities

•

Amount of time to return property to residential use

•

Changes in weather patterns

•

Local building codes

•

Construction and building material costs



•

Litigation trends

•

Trends in jury awards

•

Court interpretation of policy provisions (such as occurrence definition, or wind versus flooding)

•

Lags in reporting claims (e.g., winter damage to summer homes, hidden damage after an earthquake, hail damage to roofs and/or equipment
on roofs)

•

Court or legislative changes to the statute of limitations

Catastrophe risk factors

•

Physical concentration of policyholders

•

Availability and cost of local contractors

•

Local building codes

•

Quality of construction of damaged homes

•

Amount of time to return property to residential use

Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for homeowners and
personal lines other, a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.1% increase (decrease) in claims and claim adjustment
expense reserves.

Historically,
the one-year change in the reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business, which for statutory reporting purposes is included with the
general liability line of business) over the last nine years has varied from –17% to 3% (averaging –8%) for the Company, and from –7% to
–1% (averaging –4%) for the industry overall. The Company's
year-to-year changes are driven by, and are based on, observed events during the year. The Company believes that its range of historical outcomes is illustrative of reasonably possible one-year
changes in reserve estimates for this product line. Homeowners and personal lines other reserves represent approximately 3% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

This
line combines both liability and property coverages; however, the majority of the reserves relate to property. While property is considered a short tail coverage, the one year
change for property can be more volatile than that for the longer tail product lines. This is due to the fact that the majority of the reserve for property relates to the most recent accident year,
which is subject to the most uncertainty for all product lines. This recent accident year uncertainty is relevant to property because of weather related events which tend to be concentrated in the
second half of the year, and generally are not completely resolved until the following year. Reserve estimates associated with major catastrophes, including California wildfires in 2017, may take even
longer to resolve.



The
Company's change in reserve estimate for this product line (excluding the umbrella line of business) was 1% for 2017, 3% for 2016 and –16% for 2015. The 2017 change
primarily reflected modestly worse than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2014 and 2015. The 2016 change primarily reflected modestly worse than expected loss
experience for liability coverages for accident years 2012 through 2014. The 2015 change primarily reflected better than expected loss experience for liability coverages for accident years 2011
through 2014, and for non-catastrophe weather-related losses and non-weather-related losses for accident year 2014.

International and Other

International and other includes products written by the Company's international operations, as well as all other products not explicitly
discussed above. The principal component of "other" claim reserves is assumed reinsurance written on an excess-of-loss basis, which may include reinsurance of non-U.S. exposures, and is runoff
business.

International
and other claim liabilities result from a mix of coverages, currencies and jurisdictions/countries. The common characteristic is the need to customize the analysis to the
individual component, and the inability to rely on data characterizations and reporting requirements in the U.S. statutory reporting framework.

Due
to changes in the business mix for this line over time, including the 2013 acquisition of Dominion, the recently incurred claim liabilities are relatively shorter tail (due to both
the products and the jurisdictions involved, e.g., Canada, the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom), while the older liabilities include some from runoff operations that are extremely
long tail (e.g., U.S. excess liabilities reinsured through the London market, and several underwriting pools in runoff). The speed of claim reporting and claim settlement is a function of the
specific coverage provided, the jurisdiction, the distribution system (e.g., underwriting pool versus direct) and the proximity of the insurance sale to the insured hazard (e.g., insured
and insurer located in different countries). In particular, liabilities arising from the underwriting pools in runoff may result in significant reporting lags, settlement lags and claim complexity,
due to the need to coordinate with other pool members or co-insurers through a broker or lead-insurer for claim settlement purposes.

International
reserves are generally analyzed by country and general coverage category (e.g., General Liability in Canada, Commercial Property in the United Kingdom, etc.). The
business is also generally split by direct versus assumed reinsurance for a given coverage. Where the underlying insured hazard is outside the United States, the underlying coverages are generally
similar to those described under the Homeowners, Personal Automobile, Commercial Automobile, General Liability, Commercial Property and Surety discussions above, taking into account differences in the
legal environment and differences in terms and conditions. However, statutory coverage differences exist amongst various jurisdictions. For example, in some jurisdictions there are no aggregate policy
limits on certain liability coverages.

Other
reserves, primarily assumed reinsurance in runoff, are generally analyzed by program/pool, treaty type, and general coverage category (e.g., General
Liability—excess of loss reinsurance). Excess exposure requires the insured to "prove" not only claims under the policy, but also the prior payment of claims reaching up to the excess
policy's attachment point.

Examples
of common risk factors, or perceptions thereof, that could change and, thus, affect the required International and other reserves (beyond those included in the general
discussion section, and in the Personal Automobile, Homeowners, General Liability, Commercial Property, Commercial Automobile and Surety discussions above) include:

International and other risk factors

•

Changes in claim handling procedures, including those of the primary carriers



•

Changes in policy provisions or court interpretation of such provision

•

Economic trends

•

New theories of liability

•

Trends in jury awards

•

Changes in the propensity to sue

•

Changes in statutes of limitations

•

Changes in the underlying court system

•

Distortions from losses resulting from large single accounts or single issues

•

Changes in tort law

•

Changes in claim adjuster office structure (causing distortions in the data)

•

Changes in foreign currency exchange rates

International and other book of business risk factors

•

Changes in policy provisions (e.g., deductibles, policy limits, endorsements, "claims-made" language)

•

Changes in underwriting standards

•

Product mix (e.g., size of account, industries insured, jurisdiction mix)

Unanticipated
changes in risk factors can affect reserves. As an indicator of the causal effect that a change in one or more risk factors could have on reserves for International and
other (excluding asbestos and environmental), a 1% increase (decrease) in incremental paid loss development for each future calendar year could result in a 1.2% increase (decrease) in claims and claim
adjustment expense reserves. International and other reserves (excluding asbestos and environmental) represent approximately 8% of the Company's total claims and claim adjustment expense reserves.

International
and other represents a combination of different product lines, some of which are in runoff. Comparative historical information is not available for international product
lines as insurers domiciled outside of the United States do not file U.S. statutory reports. Comparative historical information on runoff business is not indicative of reasonably possible
one-year changes in the reserve estimate for this mix of runoff business. Accordingly, the Company has not included comparative analyses for International and other.

Reinsurance Recoverables

Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. The Company evaluates and monitors
the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from reinsurer insolvencies. In addition, in the ordinary course of
business, the Company becomes involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers. Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the
Company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The Company employs dedicated specialists and comprehensive strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.

The
Company has entered into a reinsurance contract in connection with a catastrophe bond issued by Long Point Re III. This contract meets the requirements to be accounted for as
reinsurance in accordance with guidance for accounting for reinsurance contracts. The catastrophe bond is described in more detail in "Item 1—Business—Catastrophe
Reinsurance."



The Company reports its reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon the
Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. Accordingly, the
establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. From time to time, as a
result of the long-tailed nature of the underlying liabilities, coverage complexities and potential for disputes, the Company considers the commutation of reinsurance contracts. Changes in estimated
reinsurance recoverables and commutation activity could result in additional income statement charges.

Recoverables
attributable to structured settlements relate primarily to personal injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion, for which the
Company has purchased annuities and remains contingently liable in the event of a default by the companies issuing the annuities. Recoverables attributable to mandatory pools and associations relate
primarily to workers' compensation service business. These recoverables are supported by the participating insurance companies' obligation to pay a pro rata share based on each company's voluntary
market share of written premium in each state in which it is a pool participant. In the event a member of a mandatory pool or association defaults on its share of the pool's or association's
obligations, the other members' share of such obligation increases proportionally.

Investment Valuation and Impairments

Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements

The Company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value
accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations
when available.

The
fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties,
i.e., not in a forced transaction. The estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the security was sold in an immediate sale,
e.g., a forced transaction. Additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based inputs, which may increase the potential
that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.

See
note 4 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the determination of fair value of investments.

Investment Impairments

See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of investment impairments.

Due
to the subjective nature of the Company's analysis and estimates of future cash flows, along with the judgment that must be applied in the analysis, it is possible that the Company
could reach a different conclusion whether or not to impair a security if it had access to additional information about the issuer. Additionally, it is possible that the issuer's actual ability to
meet contractual obligations may be different than what the Company determined during its analysis, which may lead to a different impairment conclusion in future periods.



Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Impairments

See note 1 of notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets.

Item 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

MARKET RISK

Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates (inclusive of credit spreads),
foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market rate or price changes. Market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying
assets are traded. The following is a discussion of the Company's primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are managed as of December 31, 2017. The Company's market risk sensitive
instruments, including derivatives, are primarily entered into for purposes other than trading.

The
carrying value of the Company's investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $72.50 billion and $70.49 billion, respectively, of which 86% was invested
in fixed maturity securities at both dates. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 7.3% and 7.1%, respectively, of the Company's invested assets were denominated in foreign currencies.
The Company's exposure to equity price risk is not significant. The Company has no direct commodity risk and is not a party to any credit default swaps.

The
primary market risks to the investment portfolio are interest rate risk and credit risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities. The portfolio duration is primarily
managed through cash market transactions and treasury futures transactions. For additional information regarding the Company's investments, see notes 3 and 4 of notes to the consolidated
financial statements as well as the "Investment Portfolio" and "Outlook" sections of "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

The
primary market risk for all of the Company's debt is interest rate risk at the time of refinancing. The Company monitors the interest rate environment and evaluates refinancing
opportunities as maturity dates approach. For additional information regarding the Company's debt, see note 8 of notes to the consolidated financial statements as well as the "Liquidity and
Capital Resources" section of "Item 7—Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

The
Company's foreign exchange market risk exposure is concentrated in the Company's invested assets, insurance reserves and shareholders' equity denominated in foreign currencies. Cash
flows from the Company's foreign operations are the primary source of funds for the purchase of investments denominated in foreign currencies. The Company purchases these investments primarily to fund
insurance reserves and other liabilities denominated in the same currency, effectively reducing its foreign currency exchange rate exposure. Invested assets denominated in the Canadian dollar
comprised approximately 4.4% of the total invested assets at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. Invested assets denominated in the British Pound Sterling comprised approximately 2.0% and 1.9% of
total invested assets at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Invested assets denominated in other currencies at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were not material.

There
were no other significant changes in the Company's primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the
year ended December 31, 2016. The Company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting
periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods.



SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

Sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings, fair values or cash flows of market sensitive
instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period of time. In the Company's sensitivity analysis model, a
hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near-term changes in those rates. "Near-term" means a period of time going forward up to one year from
the date of the consolidated financial statements. Actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure, especially since this sensitivity analysis does
not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the Company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value.

Interest Rate Risk

In this sensitivity analysis model, the Company uses fair values to measure its potential loss. The sensitivity analysis model includes the
following financial instruments entered into for purposes other than trading: fixed maturities, non-redeemable preferred stocks, mortgage loans, short-term securities, debt and derivative financial
instruments. The primary market risk to the Company's market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk (inclusive of credit spreads). The sensitivity analysis model uses various basis point changes
in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model.

For
invested assets with primary exposure to interest rate risk, estimates of portfolio duration and convexity are used to model the loss of fair value that would be expected to result
from a parallel increase in interest rates. Durations on invested assets are adjusted for call, put and interest rate reset features. Durations on tax-exempt securities are adjusted for the fact that
the yields on such securities do not normally move in lockstep with changes in the U.S. Treasury curve. Fixed maturity portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis, including
accrued interest, using holdings as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.

For
debt, the change in fair value is determined by calculating hypothetical December 31, 2017 and 2016 ending prices based on yields adjusted to reflect a 100 basis point change,
comparing such hypothetical ending prices to actual ending prices, and multiplying the difference by the par or securities outstanding.

The
sensitivity analysis model used by the Company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of approximately $2.08 billion and $2.19 billion based on a
100 basis point increase in interest rates at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The
loss estimates do not take into account the impact of possible interventions that the Company might reasonably undertake in order to mitigate or avoid losses that would result from
emerging interest rate trends. In addition, the loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the Company's financial instruments.

Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

The Company uses fair values of investment securities to measure its potential loss from foreign denominated investments. A hypothetical 10%
reduction in value of foreign denominated investments is used to estimate the impact on the market value of the foreign denominated holdings. The Company's analysis indicates that a hypothetical 10%
reduction in the value of foreign denominated investments would be expected to produce a loss in fair value of approximately $528 million and $502 million at December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively.

The Travelers Companies, Inc.:

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of The Travelers Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedules as listed in the accompanying index to consolidated financial statements and schedules (collectively, the
"consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31,
2017 and 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2017, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the Company's internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 15, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting.

Basis for Opinion

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these
consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the
U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the
consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the
amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Basis of Presentation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of The Travelers Companies, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the
Company). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
claims and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2016 and 2015 financial statements to conform to the
2017 presentation, including reclassifications related to the realignment of the Company's reportable business segments as described in the "Nature of Operations" section of this note. All material
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.

On
August 4, 2017, the Company completed its previously announced acquisition of all issued and outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings Ltd (Simply Business), a
leading provider of small business insurance policies in the United Kingdom, for a purchase price of approximately $464 million, which included the repayment of debt and other obligations of
Simply Business. In addition, the Company issued 95,953 shares of restricted common stock valued at approximately $12 million to certain employees of Simply Business who were equity holders of
Simply Business. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, 50% of the restricted stock will vest two years from the issuance date and the remainder will vest three years from the issuance
date. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in May 2017 (described in more detail in note 8) and internal resources to fund this transaction.

Adoption of Accounting Standards

Investments—Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity
Method of Accounting

In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement to retroactively apply
the equity method of accounting when an investment that was previously accounted for using another method of accounting becomes qualified to apply the equity method due to an increase in the level of
ownership interest or degree of influence. If the investment was previously accounted for as an available-for-sale security, any related unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive
income at the date the investment becomes qualified for the equity method is recognized through earnings. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2016, and was applied prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Derivatives and Hedging: Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments

In March 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance clarifying that when a call (put) option in a debt instrument can accelerate the repayment of
principal on the debt instrument, a reporting entity does not need to assess whether the contingent event that triggers the ability to exercise the call (put) option is related to interest rates or
credit risk in determining whether the option should be accounted for separately. The updated guidance was effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15,

2016.
The adoption of this guidance did not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Compensation—Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost
and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost

In March 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance to improve the presentation of net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement cost
(net benefit costs). Net benefit costs comprise several components that reflect different aspects of an employer's financial arrangements as well as the cost of benefits provided to employees. The
updated guidance requires that the employer service cost component be reported in the same lines as other employee compensation cost and that the other components (non-service costs) be presented
separately from the service cost and outside of a subtotal of income from operations if one is presented. The updated guidance also allows only the service cost component to be eligible for
capitalization in assets when applicable.

The
updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is to be applied retrospectively with respect to the presentation of service and
non-service costs, and prospectively with respect to service costs only being eligible for capitalization. Early adoption is permitted as of the first interim period of an annual period if an entity
issues interim financial statements.

The
Company adopted the updated guidance effective January 1, 2017. See note 14 which has been expanded to disclose the amount of service cost and non-service cost
components of net periodic benefit cost and the line items in the consolidated statements of income in which such amounts are reported. The updated guidance with respect to only service costs being
eligible for capitalization in assets was not applicable, as the Company capitalizes only commission and premium-related taxes in deferred acquisition costs.

Compensation—Stock Compensation: Scope of Modification Accounting

In May 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance related to a change to the terms or conditions (modification) of a share-based payment award. The
updated guidance provides that an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless the fair value and vesting conditions of the modified award and the classification of the modified
award (equity or liability instrument) are the same as the original award immediately before the modification.

The
updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The update is to be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date. Early
adoption is permitted in any interim periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance.

The
Company adopted the updated guidance effective April 1, 2017. The adoption did not have an effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Other Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued updated guidance to clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. While insurance contracts are not within the
scope of this updated guidance, the Company's fee income related to providing claims and policy management services as well as claim and loss prevention



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

services
will, to the extent such services are not related to the insurance contracts issued by the Company, be subject to this updated guidance.

The
updated guidance requires an entity to recognize revenue as performance obligations are met, in order to reflect the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount
that reflects the consideration the entity is entitled to receive for those goods or services. The following steps are applied in the updated guidance: (1) identify the contract(s) with a
customer; (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determine the transaction price; (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the
contract; and (5) recognize revenue when, or as, the entity satisfies a performance obligation.

The
updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2018. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have any effect on the Company's results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.

Financial Instruments—Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities

In January 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to address the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of certain financial
instruments. The updated guidance requires equity investments, except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, that have readily determinable fair value to be measured at fair value
with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Such equity investments are no longer required to be classified as available for sale or trading securities. Equity investments that do not have
readily determinable fair values may be remeasured at fair value either upon the occurrence of an observable price change or upon identification of an impairment. A qualitative assessment for
impairment is required for equity investments without readily determinable fair values. The updated guidance also eliminates the requirement to disclose the method and significant assumptions used to
estimate the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet. The updated guidance is effective for the quarter ending March 31, 2018 and will result in the
recognition of $22 million of net after-tax unrealized gains on equity investments as a cumulative effect adjustment that will increase retained earnings as of January 1, 2018 and
decrease accumulated other comprehensive income by a corresponding amount.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance to require lessees to recognize a right-to-use asset and a lease liability for leases with
terms of more than 12 months. The updated guidance retains the two classifications of a lease as either an operating or finance lease (previously referred to as a capital lease). Both lease
classifications require the lessee to record the right-to-use asset and the lease liability based upon the present value of cash flows. Finance leases will reflect the financial arrangement by
recognizing interest expense on the lease liability separately from the amortization expense of the right-to-use asset. Operating leases will recognize lease expense (with no separate recognition of
interest expense) on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. The accounting by lessors is not significantly changed by the updated guidance. The updated guidance requires expanded
qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including additional information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.

The
updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and will require that the earliest comparative period presented include the measurement
and recognition of



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

existing
leases with an adjustment to equity as if the updated guidance had always been applied. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on
the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity.

Financial Instruments—Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments

In June 2016, the FASB issued updated guidance for the accounting for credit losses for financial instruments. The updated guidance applies a
new credit loss model (current expected credit losses or CECL) for determining credit-related impairments for financial instruments measured at amortized cost (e.g. reinsurance recoverables,
including structured settlements that are recorded as part of reinsurance recoverables) and requires an entity to estimate the credit losses expected over the life of an exposure or pool of exposures.
The estimate of expected credit losses should consider historical information, current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts, including estimates of prepayments. The expected
credit losses, and subsequent adjustments to such losses, will be recorded through an allowance account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset, with the net carrying
value of the financial asset presented on the consolidated balance sheet at the amount expected to be collected.

The
updated guidance also amends the current other-than-temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities by requiring the recognition of impairments relating to credit
losses through an allowance account and limits the amount of credit loss to the difference between a security's amortized cost basis and its fair value. In addition, the length of time a security has
been in an unrealized loss position will no longer impact the determination of whether a credit loss exists.

The
updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2018. Based on the financial instruments currently held by the Company, there would not be a material effect on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity if the new guidance
were able to be adopted in the current accounting period. The impact on the Company's results of operations, financial position or liquidity at the date of adoption of the updated guidance will be
determined by the financial instruments held by the Company and the economic conditions at that time.

Intangibles—Goodwill and Other

In January 2017, the FASB issued updated guidance that eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill
(i.e., Step 2 of the current goodwill impairment test) to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, entities will record an impairment charge by comparing a reporting unit's fair value
with its carrying amount and recognizing an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying amount over estimated fair value (i.e., Step 1 of current guidance). The implied fair value of
goodwill is currently determined in Step 2 by deducting the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit (determined in the same manner as a business combination) from the reporting
unit's fair value as determined in Step 1 (including any corporate-level assets or liabilities that were included in the determination of the carrying amount and fair value of the reporting unit in
Step 1). The updated guidance requires an entity to perform its annual, or interim, impairment test by either: (1) an initial qualitative assessment of factors (such as changes in
management, key personnel, strategy, key technology or customers) that may impact a reporting unit's fair value and lead to the



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

determination
that it is more likely than not that the reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value, including goodwill (consistent with current guidance), or (2) applying Step
1.

The
updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and is to be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual
goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's results of operations,
financial position or liquidity.

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income

On February 14, 2018, the FASB issued updated guidance that allows a reclassification of the stranded tax effects in accumulated other
comprehensive income (AOCI) resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). Current guidance requires the effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred tax balances to be reported in
income from continuing operations in the accounting period that includes the period of enactment, even if the related income tax effects were originally charged or credited directly to AOCI. The
amount of the reclassification
would include the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate on the gross deferred tax amounts and related valuation allowances, if any, at the date of the enactment of TCJA
related to items in AOCI. The updated guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and is to be applied retrospectively to each period in which the effect of
the TCJA related to items remaining in AOCI are recognized or at the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted.

The
Company expects to adopt the updated guidance effective January 1, 2018. The adoption will not affect the Company's results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.

Accounting Policies

Investments

Fixed Maturity and Equity Securities

Fixed maturities include bonds, notes and redeemable preferred stocks. Fixed maturities, including instruments subject to securities lending
agreements, are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value, with unrealized investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to other comprehensive
income. Equity securities, which include public common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of
income taxes, charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income.

Real Estate Investments

The Company's real estate investments include warehouses, office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly owned.
Real estate is recorded on the purchase date at the purchase price, which generally represents fair value, and is supported by internal analysis or external appraisals that use discounted cash flow
analyses and other acceptable valuation techniques. Real estate held for investment purposes is subsequently carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Buildings
are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the expected useful life of the building or 39 years. Real estate held for sale is carried at lower of cost
or fair value, less estimated costs to sell.



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Short-term Securities

Short-term securities have an original maturity of less than one year and are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value.

Other Investments

Investments in Private Equity Limited Partnerships, Hedge Funds and Real Estate Partnerships

The
Company uses the equity method of accounting for investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships. The partnerships and the hedge funds
generally
report investments on their balance sheet at fair value. The financial statements prepared by the investee are received by the Company on a lag basis, with the lag period generally dependent upon the
type of underlying investments. The private equity and real estate partnerships provide financial information quarterly which is generally available to investors, including the Company, within three
to six months following the date of the reporting period. The hedge funds provide financial information monthly, which is generally available to investors within one month following the date of the
reporting period. The Company regularly requests financial information from the partnerships prior to the receipt of the partnerships' financial statements and records any material information
obtained from these requests in its consolidated financial statements.

Other

Also
included in other investments are non-public common equities, preferred equities and derivatives. Non-public common equities and preferred equities are reported at
fair value with changes in fair value, net of income taxes, charged or credited directly to other comprehensive income. The Company's derivative financial instruments are carried at fair value, with
the changes in fair value reflected in the consolidated statements of income in net realized investment gains (losses). For a further discussion of the derivatives used by the Company, see
note 3.

Net Investment Income

Investment income from fixed maturities is recognized based on the constant effective yield method which includes an adjustment for estimated
principal pre-payments, if any. The effective yield used to determine amortization for fixed maturities subject to prepayment risk (e.g., asset-backed, loan-backed and structured securities) is
recalculated and adjusted periodically based upon actual historical and/or projected future cash flows, which are obtained from a widely-accepted securities data provider. The adjustments to the yield
for highly rated prepayable fixed maturities are accounted for using the retrospective method. The adjustments to the yield for non-highly rated prepayable fixed maturities are accounted for using the
prospective method. Dividends on equity securities (including those with transfer restrictions) are recognized in income when declared. Rental income on real estate is recognized on a straight-line
basis over the lease term. See the section titled: "

Real Estate

" in note 3 for further discussion. Investments in private equity limited
partnerships, hedge funds, real estate partnerships and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting, whereby the Company's share of the investee's earnings or losses in the
fund is reported in net investment income.

Accrual
of income is suspended on non-securitized fixed maturities that are in default, or on which it is likely that future payments will not be made as scheduled. Interest income on
investments in



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

default
is recognized only when payments are received. Investments included in the consolidated balance sheet that were not income-producing for the preceding 12 months were not material.

For
fixed maturities where the Company records an other-than-temporary impairment, a determination is made as to the cause of the impairment and whether the Company expects a recovery in
the value. For fixed maturities where the Company expects a recovery in value, not necessarily to par, the constant effective yield method is utilized, and the investment is amortized to the expected
recovery amount.

Investment Gains and Losses

Net realized investment gains and losses are included as a component of pre-tax revenues based upon specific identification of the investments
sold on the trade date. Included in net realized investment gains (losses) are other-than-temporary impairment losses on invested assets other than those investments accounted for using the equity
method of accounting as described in the "Investment Impairments" section that follows.

Investment Impairments

The Company conducts a periodic review to identify and evaluate invested assets having other-than-temporary impairments. Some of the factors
considered in identifying other-than-temporary impairments include: (1) for fixed maturity investments, whether the Company intends to sell the investment or whether it is more likely than not
that the Company will be required to sell the investment prior to an anticipated recovery in value; (2) for non-fixed maturity investments, the Company's ability and intent to retain the
investment for a reasonable period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value; (3) the likelihood of the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity
securities (i.e., whether there is a credit loss) or cost for equity securities; (4) the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed
maturity securities or cost for equity securities; and (5) the financial condition, near-term and long-term
prospects for the issuer, including the relevant industry conditions and trends, and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments of Fixed Maturities and Equity Securities

For fixed maturity investments that the Company does not intend to sell or for which it is more likely than not that the Company would not be
required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the Company separates the credit loss component of the impairment from the amount related to all other factors and reports the credit loss
component in net realized investment gains (losses). The impairment related to all other factors is reported in other comprehensive income.

For
equity securities (including public common and non-redeemable preferred stock) and for fixed maturity investments the Company intends to sell or for which it is more likely than not
that the Company will be required to sell before an anticipated recovery in value, the full amount of the impairment is included in net realized investment gains (losses).

Upon
recognizing an other-than-temporary impairment, the new cost basis of the investment is the previous amortized cost basis less the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in net
realized investment gains (losses). The new cost basis is not adjusted for any subsequent recoveries in fair value; however, for fixed maturity investments the difference between the new cost basis
and the expected

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

cash
flows is accreted on a quarterly basis to net investment income over the remaining expected life of the investment.

Determination of Credit Loss—Fixed Maturities

The Company determines the credit loss component of fixed maturity investments by utilizing discounted cash flow modeling to determine the
present value of the security and
comparing the present value with the amortized cost of the security. If the amortized cost is greater than the present value of the expected cash flows, the difference is considered a credit loss and
recognized in net realized investment gains (losses).

For
non-structured fixed maturities (U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities, obligations of states, municipalities and political
subdivisions, debt securities issued by foreign governments and certain corporate debt), the estimate of expected cash flows is determined by projecting a recovery value and a recovery time frame and
assessing whether further principal and interest will be received. The determination of recovery value incorporates an issuer valuation assumption utilizing one or a combination of valuation methods
as deemed appropriate by the Company. The Company determines the undiscounted recovery value by allocating the estimated value of the issuer to the Company's assessment of the priority of claims. The
present value of the cash flows is determined by applying the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied
rate has changed as a result of a previous impairment) and an estimated recovery time frame. Generally, that time frame for securities for which the issuer is in bankruptcy is 12 months. For
securities for which the issuer is financially troubled but not in bankruptcy, that time frame is generally 24 months. Included in the present value calculation are expected principal and
interest payments; however, for securities for which the issuer is classified as bankrupt or in default, the present value calculation assumes no interest payments and a single recovery amount.

In
estimating the recovery value, significant judgment is involved in the development of assumptions relating to a myriad of factors related to the issuer including, but not limited to,
revenue, margin and earnings projections, the likely market or liquidation values of assets, potential additional debt to be incurred pre- or post-bankruptcy/restructuring, the ability to shift
existing or new debt to different priority layers, the amount of restructuring/bankruptcy expenses, the size and priority of unfunded pension obligations, litigation or other contingent claims, the
treatment of intercompany claims and the likely outcome with respect to inter-creditor conflicts.

For
structured fixed maturity securities (primarily residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities), the Company estimates the present value of the
security by projecting future cash flows of the assets underlying the securitization, allocating the flows to the various tranches based on the structure of the securitization and determining the
present value of the cash flows using the effective yield of the security at the date of acquisition (or the most recent implied rate used to accrete the security if the implied rate has changed as a
result of a previous impairment or changes in expected cash flows). The Company incorporates levels of delinquencies, defaults and severities as well as credit attributes of the remaining assets in
the securitization, along with other economic data, to arrive at its best estimate of the parameters applied to the assets underlying the securitization. In order to project cash flows, the following
assumptions are applied to the assets underlying the securitization: (1) voluntary prepayment rates, (2) default rates and (3) loss severity. The

Real Estate Investments

On
at least an annual basis, the Company obtains independent appraisals for substantially all of its real estate investments. In addition, the carrying value of all
real estate investments is reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The review for impairment
considers the valuation from the independent appraisal, when applicable, and incorporates an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the
real estate property. An impairment loss is recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the real estate property. The impairment loss is the amount by
which the carrying amount exceeds fair value.

Other Investments

Investments in Private Equity Limited Partnerships, Hedge Funds and Real Estate Partnerships

The Company reviews its investments in private equity limited partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships for impairment no less
frequently than quarterly and monitors the performance throughout the year through discussions with the managers/general partners. If the Company becomes aware of an impairment of a partnership's
investments at the balance sheet date prior to receiving the partnership's financial statements, it will recognize an impairment by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the partnership with
a corresponding charge to net investment income.

Changes in Intent to Sell Temporarily Impaired Assets

The
Company may, from time to time, sell invested assets subsequent to the balance sheet date that it did not intend to sell at the balance sheet date. Conversely, the
Company may not sell invested assets that it asserted that it intended to sell at the balance sheet date. Such changes in intent are due to events occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date. The
types of events that may result in a change in intent include, but are not limited to, significant changes in the economic facts and circumstances related to the invested asset (e.g., a
downgrade or upgrade from a rating agency), significant unforeseen changes in liquidity needs, or changes in tax laws or the regulatory environment.

Securities Lending

The Company has, from time to time, engaged in securities lending activities from which it generates net investment income by lending certain of
its investments to other institutions for short periods of time. Borrowers of these securities provide collateral equal to at least 102% of the market value of the loaned securities plus accrued
interest. This collateral is held by a third-party custodian, and the Company has the right to access the collateral only in the event that the institution borrowing the Company's securities is in
default under the lending agreement. Therefore, the Company does not



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

recognize
the receipt of the collateral held by the third-party custodian or the obligation to return the collateral. The loaned securities remain a recorded asset of the Company. The Company accepts
only cash as collateral for securities on loan and restricts the manner in which that cash is invested.

Reinsurance Recoverables

Amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the associated claim liability. The Company reports its
reinsurance recoverables net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. The allowance is based upon the Company's ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection
periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, disputes, applicable coverage defenses and other relevant factors. Amounts deemed to be uncollectible, including amounts due from known insolvent
reinsurers, are written off against the allowance for estimated uncollectible reinsurance recoverables. Any subsequent collections of amounts previously written off are reported as part of claims and
claim adjustment expenses. The Company evaluates and monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to minimize its exposure to significant losses from
reinsurer insolvencies.

Deferred Acquisition Costs

Incremental direct costs of acquired, new and renewal insurance contracts, consisting of commissions (other than contingent commissions) and
premium-related taxes, are capitalized and charged to expense pro rata over the contract periods in which the related premiums are earned. Deferred acquisition costs are reviewed to determine if they
are recoverable from future income and, if not, are charged to expense. Future investment income attributable to related premiums is taken into account in measuring the recoverability of the carrying
value of this asset. All other acquisition expenses are charged to operations as incurred.

Contractholder Receivables and Payables

Under certain workers' compensation insurance contracts with deductible features, the Company is obligated to pay the claimant for the full
amount of the claim. The Company is subsequently reimbursed by the policyholder for the deductible amount. These amounts are included on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheets in
contractholder payables and contractholder receivables, respectively.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

The Company performs a review, on at least an annual basis, of goodwill held by the reporting units which are the Company's three operating and
reportable segments: Business Insurance; Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Personal Insurance. The Company estimates the fair value of its reporting units and compares it to their carrying value,
including goodwill. If the carrying values of the reporting units were to exceed their fair value, the amount of the impairment would be calculated and goodwill adjusted accordingly.



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of its reporting units. The discounted cash flow model is an income approach to valuation that is based on a
detailed cash flow analysis for deriving a current fair value of reporting units and is representative of the Company's reporting units' current and expected future financial performance. The discount
rate assumptions reflect the Company's assessment of the risks inherent in the projected future cash flows and the
Company's weighted-average cost of capital, and are compared against available market data for reasonableness.

Other
indefinite-lived intangible assets held by the Company are also reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis. The classification of the asset as indefinite-lived is
reassessed and an impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.

Intangible
assets that are deemed to have a finite useful life are amortized over their useful lives. The carrying amount of intangible assets with a finite useful life is regularly
reviewed for indicators of impairment in value. Impairment is recognized only if the carrying amount of the intangible asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows and is measured as the
difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.

As
a result of the reviews performed for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company determined that the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the
respective carrying value of its reporting units for those years and that goodwill was not impaired. The Company also determined during its reviews for each year that its other indefinite-lived
intangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets were not impaired.

Claims and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves

Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent estimates for the ultimate cost of unpaid reported and unreported claims incurred and
related expenses. The reserves are adjusted regularly based upon experience. Included in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves in the consolidated balance sheets are reserves for long-term
disability and annuity claim payments, primarily arising from workers' compensation insurance and workers' compensation excess insurance policies, that are discounted to the present value of estimated
future payments.

The
Company performs a continuing review of its claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, including its reserving techniques and the impact of reinsurance. The reserves are also
reviewed regularly by qualified actuaries employed by the Company. Since the reserves are based on estimates, the ultimate liability may be more or less than such reserves. The effects of changes in
such estimated reserves are included in the results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. Such changes in estimates could occur in a future period and may be material to the
Company's results of operations and financial position in such period.

Other Liabilities

Included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets is the Company's estimate of its liability for guaranty fund and other
insurance-related assessments. The liability for expected state guaranty fund and other premium-based assessments is recognized as the Company writes or becomes obligated to write or renew the
premiums on which the assessments are expected to be based. The liability for loss-based assessments is recognized as the related losses are incurred. At December 31,



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

and 2016, the Company had a liability of $231 million and $242 million, respectively, for guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments and related recoverables of
$16 million at both dates. The liability for such assessments and the related recoverables are not discounted for the time value of money. The loss-based assessments are expected to be paid
over a period ranging from one year to the life expectancy of certain workers' compensation claimants and the recoveries are expected to occur over the same period of time.

Also
included in other liabilities is an accrual for policyholder dividends. Certain insurance contracts, primarily workers' compensation, are participating whereby dividends are paid to
policyholders in accordance with contract provisions. Net written premiums for participating dividend policies were approximately 1%, 1% and 2% of total net written premiums for the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Policyholder dividends are accrued against earnings using best available estimates of amounts to be paid. The liability accrued for policyholder
dividends totaled $67 million and $62 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Treasury Stock

The cost of common stock repurchased by the Company is reported as treasury stock and represents authorized and unissued shares of the Company
under the Minnesota Business Corporation Act.

Statutory Accounting Practices

The Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the State of Connecticut, are required to prepare statutory financial
statements in accordance with the accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance departments of the states of domicile. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are those practices
that are incorporated directly or by reference in state laws, regulations, and general administrative rules applicable to all insurance enterprises domiciled in a particular state. The State of
Connecticut requires insurers domiciled in Connecticut to prepare their statutory financial statements in accordance with National Association of Insurance Commissioners' (NAIC) statutory accounting
practices.

Permitted
statutory accounting practices are those practices that differ either from state-prescribed statutory accounting practices or NAIC statutory accounting practices.

The
Company does not apply any statutory accounting practices that would be considered a prescribed or permitted statutory accounting practice that differs from NAIC statutory accounting
practices.

The
Company's non-U.S. insurance subsidiaries file financial statements prepared in accordance with the regulatory reporting requirements of their respective local jurisdiction.

Premiums and Unearned Premium Reserves

Premiums are recognized as revenues pro rata over the policy period. Unearned premium reserves represent the unexpired portion of policy
premiums. Accrued retrospective premiums are included in premium balances receivable. Premium balances receivable are reported net of an allowance for estimated uncollectible premium amounts.



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)

Ceded
premiums are charged to income over the applicable term of the various reinsurance contracts with third party reinsurers. Prepaid reinsurance premiums represent the unexpired
portion of premiums ceded to reinsurers and are reported as part of other assets.

Fee Income

Fee income includes servicing fees from carriers and revenues from large deductible policies and service contracts and is recognized pro rata
over the contract or policy periods.

Other Revenues

Other revenues include revenues from premium installment charges, which are recognized as collected, revenues of noninsurance subsidiaries other
than fee income and gains and losses on dispositions of assets and redemption of debt, and other miscellaneous revenues, including a gain recognized as a result of the settlement of a reinsurance
dispute.

Income Taxes

The Company recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax effects attributable to temporary differences
between the financial statement and tax return bases of assets and liabilities, based on enacted tax rates and other provisions of the tax law. The effect of a change in tax laws or rates on deferred
tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income
in the period in which such change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized.

Foreign Currency Translation

The Company assigns functional currencies to its foreign operations, which are generally the currencies of the local operating environment.
Foreign currency amounts are remeasured to the functional currency, and the resulting foreign exchange gains or losses are reflected in earnings. Functional currency amounts are then translated into
U.S. dollars. The foreign currency remeasurement and translation are calculated using current exchange rates for items reported in the balance sheets and average exchange rates for items recorded in
earnings. The change in unrealized foreign currency translation gain or loss during the year, net of tax, is a component of other comprehensive income.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company has an employee stock incentive compensation plan that permits grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock
appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock, stock units, performance awards and other share-based or share-denominated awards with respect to the Company's common stock.

Compensation
cost is measured based on the grant-date fair value of an award, utilizing the assumptions discussed in note 13. Compensation cost is recognized for financial
reporting purposes over the period in which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (generally the vesting period). In connection with certain share-based awards,
participants are entitled to receive dividends during the vesting period, either in cash or dividend equivalent shares, commensurate with the dividends paid to common shareholders. Dividends and
dividend equivalent

shares
on awards that are expected to vest are recorded in retained earnings. Dividends paid on awards that are not expected to vest as part of the Company's forfeiture estimate are recorded as
compensation expense.

Nature of Operations

Effective April 1, 2017, the Company's results are reported in the following three business segments—Business Insurance,
Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance, reflecting a change in the manner in which the Company's businesses were being managed as of that date, as well as the aggregation of products
and services based on the type of customer, how the business is marketed and the manner in which risks are underwritten. While the segmentation of the Company's domestic businesses was unchanged, the
Company's international businesses, which were previously managed and reported in total within the Business and International Insurance segment, were disaggregated by product type among the three
newly aligned reportable business segments. All prior periods presented have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. In connection with these changes, the Company revised the names and
descriptions of certain businesses comprising the Company's segments and has reflected other related changes. The reportable business segments are as follows:

Personal Insurance

Personal Insurance writes a broad range of property and casualty insurance covering individuals' personal risks, primarily in the United States,
as well as in Canada. The primary products of automobile and homeowners insurance are complemented by a broad suite of related coverages.

Automobile
policies provide coverage for liability to others for both bodily injury and property damage, uninsured motorist protection, and for physical damage to an insured's own
vehicle from collision, fire, flood, hail and theft. In addition, many states require policies to provide first-party personal injury protection, frequently referred to as no-fault coverage.

Homeowners
policies provide protection against losses to dwellings and contents from a variety of perils (excluding flooding) as well as coverage for personal liability. The Company
writes homeowners insurance for dwellings, condominiums and tenants, and rental properties. The Company also writes
coverage for boats and yachts and valuable personal items such as jewelry, and also writes coverages for umbrella liability, identity fraud, and weddings and special events.

2. SEGMENT INFORMATION

The accounting policies used to prepare the segment reporting data for the Company's three reportable business segments are the same as those described in the Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies in note 1.

Except
as described below for certain legal entities, the Company allocates its invested assets and the related net investment income to its reportable business segments. Pre-tax net
investment income is allocated based upon an investable funds concept, which takes into account liabilities (net of non-invested assets) and appropriate capital considerations for each segment. For
investable funds, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the estimated duration of the loss reserves' future cash flows, the interest rate environment at the time the losses were
incurred and A+ rated corporate debt instrument yields. For capital, a benchmark investment yield is developed that reflects the average yield on the total investment portfolio. The benchmark
investment yields are applied to each segment's investable funds and capital, respectively, to produce a total notional investment income by segment. The Company's actual net investment income is
allocated to each segment in proportion to the respective segment's notional investment income to total notional investment income. There are certain legal entities within the Company that are
dedicated to specific reportable business segments. The invested assets and related net investment income from these legal entities are reported in the applicable business segment and are not
allocated among the other business segments.

The
cost of the Company's catastrophe treaty program is included in the Company's ceded premiums and is allocated among reportable business segments based on an estimate of actual market
reinsurance pricing using expected losses calculated by the Company's catastrophe model, adjusted for any experience adjustments.

Pre-refunded
bonds of $3.90 billion and $5.16 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, were bonds for which states or municipalities have established
irrevocable trusts, almost exclusively comprised of U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities. These trusts were created to fund the payment
of principal and interest due under the bonds.

The
Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 and 2016 included $2.41 billion and $1.71 billion, respectively, of residential
mortgage-backed securities, which include pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). Included in the totals at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $804 million
and $563 million, respectively, of GNMA, FNMA, FHLMC (excluding FHA project loans) and Canadian government guaranteed residential mortgage-backed pass-through securities classified as available
for sale. Also included in those totals were residential CMOs classified as available for sale with a fair value of $1.61 billion and $1.15 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. Approximately 55% and 51% of the Company's CMO holdings at December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively, were guaranteed by or fully collateralized by securities issued by GNMA, FNMA or FHLMC. The weighted average credit rating of the $717 million and $566 million of
non-guaranteed CMO holdings at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was "A1" and "Baa2," respectively. The weighted average credit rating of all of the above securities was "Aa1" and "Aa2"
at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS, including FHA project loans) of $1.17 billion and $938 million,
respectively, which are included in "All other corporate bonds" in the tables above. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately $475 million and $290 million of these
securities, respectively, or the loans backing such securities, contained guarantees by the U.S. government or a government-sponsored enterprise. The weighted average credit rating of the
$693 million and $648 million of non-guaranteed securities at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was "Aaa" at both dates. The CMBS portfolio is supported by loans that are
diversified across economic sectors and geographical areas. The weighted average credit rating of the CMBS portfolio was "Aaa" at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.

At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $304 million and $286 million, respectively, of securities on loan as part of a tri-party lending agreement.

Proceeds
from sales of fixed maturities classified as available for sale were $1.85 billion, $1.42 billion and $1.95 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Gross gains of $42 million, $79 million and $95 million and gross losses of $38 million, $20 million and $14 million were realized on those sales in 2017,
2016 and 2015, respectively.

At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's insurance subsidiaries had $4.41 billion and $4.56 billion, respectively, of securities on deposit at financial
institutions in certain states pursuant to the respective states' insurance regulatory requirements. Funds deposited with third parties to be used as collateral to secure various liabilities on behalf
of insureds, cedants and other creditors had a fair value of $35 million at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. Other investments pledged as collateral securing outstanding letters of
credit had a fair value of $1 million and $3 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, the Company utilizes Lloyd's trust deposits, whereby owned
securities with a fair value of approximately $37 million and $97 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and $33 million
held by TRV at December 31, 2017, were pledged into Lloyd's trust accounts to provide a portion of the capital needed to support the Company's obligations at Lloyd's.

3. INVESTMENTS (Continued)

Real Estate

The Company's real estate investments include warehouses, office buildings and other commercial land and properties that are directly owned. The
Company negotiates commercial leases with individual tenants through unrelated, licensed real estate brokers. Negotiated terms and conditions include, among others, rental rates, length of lease
period and improvements to the premises to be provided by the landlord.

Proceeds
from the sale of real estate investments were $23 million, $69 million and $31 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross gains of
$10 million, $7 million and $4 million were realized on those sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and there were no gross losses. Accumulated depreciation on real estate
held for investment purposes was $364 million and $332 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Future
minimum rental income on operating leases relating to the Company's real estate properties is expected to be $90 million, $85 million, $70 million,
$56 million and $44 million for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and $58 million for 2023 and thereafter.

Short-term Securities

The Company's short-term securities consist of Aaa-rated registered money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities, high-quality commercial paper
(primarily A1/P1) and high-quality corporate securities purchased within a year to their maturity with a combined average of 71 days to maturity at December 31, 2017. The amortized cost
of these securities, which totaled $4.90 billion and $4.87 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, approximated their fair value.

Variable Interest Entities

Entities which do not have sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support or in
which the equity investors, as a group, do not have the characteristic of a controlling financial interest are referred to as variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated by the variable
interest holder that is determined to have the controlling financial interest (primary beneficiary) as a result of having both the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly
impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company determines whether it
is the primary beneficiary of an entity subject to consolidation based on a qualitative assessment of the VIE's capital structure, contractual terms, nature of the VIE's operations and purpose and the
Company's relative exposure to the related risks of the VIE on the date it becomes initially involved in the VIE. The Company reassesses its VIE determination with respect to an entity on an ongoing
basis.

The
Company is a passive investor in limited partner equity interests issued by third party VIEs. These include certain of the Company's investments in private equity limited
partnerships, hedge funds and real estate partnerships where the Company is not related to the general partner. These investments are generally accounted for under the equity method and reported in
the Company's consolidated balance sheet as other investments unless the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary. These equity interests generally cannot be redeemed. Distributions from these
investments are received by the Company as a result of liquidation of the underlying investments of the funds and/or as income

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

3. INVESTMENTS (Continued)

distribution.
The Company's maximum exposure to loss with respect to these investments is limited to the investment carrying amounts reported in the Company's consolidated balance sheet and any
unfunded commitment. The Company considers an investment in a VIE in which it has a 20% or greater equity interest as a significant VIE. Neither the Company's carrying amounts nor the unfunded
commitments related to these significant VIE's are material individually or in the aggregate.

Unrealized Investment Losses

The following tables summarize, for all investments in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate fair
value and gross unrealized loss by length of time those securities have been continuously in an unrealized loss position. The fair value amounts reported in the tables are estimates that are prepared
using the process described in note 4. The Company also relies upon estimates of several factors in its review and evaluation of individual investments, using the process described in
note 1, in determining whether such investments are other-than-temporarily impaired.

Concentrations and Credit Quality

Concentrations of credit risk arise from exposure to counterparties that are engaged in similar activities and have similar economic
characteristics that could cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions. The Company seeks to mitigate credit risk by
actively monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties, obtaining collateral as deemed appropriate and applying controls that include credit approvals, limits of credit exposure and other
monitoring procedures.

At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, other than U.S. Treasury securities and obligations of U.S. government and government agencies and authorities, the Company was not exposed to any
concentration of credit risk of a single issuer greater than 5% of the Company's shareholders' equity.

Included
in fixed maturities are below investment grade securities totaling $1.67 billion and $1.76 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company
defines its below investment grade securities as those securities rated below investment grade by external rating agencies, or the equivalent by the Company when a public rating does not exist. Such
securities include below investment grade bonds that are publicly traded and certain other privately issued bonds that are classified as below investment grade loans.

The
total impact of net unrealized gains on investment securities was $1.11 billion after-tax at December 31, 2017, which included the $954 million reported in
accumulated other comprehensive income shown above, as well as $158 million included in retained earnings that was part of the impact of enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 recorded
in earnings.

Derivative Financial Instruments

From time to time, the Company enters into U.S. Treasury note futures contracts to modify the effective duration of specific assets within the
investment portfolio. U.S. Treasury futures contracts require a daily mark-to-market and settlement with the broker. At both December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company had $400 million
notional value of open U.S. Treasury futures contracts. Net realized investment losses related to U.S. Treasury futures contracts in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.

The
Company also sells a small amount of U.S. equity index put option contracts that are settled for cash upon their expiration or when they are rolled over. Net realized investment
losses related to these derivatives in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were not significant.

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company's estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based
on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair
value estimates in the fair value accounting guidance hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the
estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's significant market
assumptions. The level in the fair value hierarchy



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

within
which the fair value measurement is reported is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the measurement in its entirety. The three levels of the hierarchy are as
follows:

•

Level 1

—

Unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities
in active markets that the Company has the ability to access.

•

Level 2

—

Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;
quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets; or valuations based on models where the significant inputs are observable (e.g., interest rates, yield curves,
prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severities, etc.) or can be corroborated by observable market data.

•

Level 3

—

Valuations based on models where significant inputs are not
observable. The unobservable inputs reflect the Company's own assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use.

Valuation of Investments Reported at Fair Value in Financial Statements

The fair value of a financial instrument is the estimated amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between
knowledgeable, unrelated, willing parties, i.e., not in a forced transaction. The estimated fair value of a financial instrument may differ from the amount that could be realized if the
security was sold in an immediate sale, e.g., a forced transaction. Additionally, the valuation of investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to the lack of market based
inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction would occur.

For
investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, the Company uses the unadjusted quoted market prices as fair value and includes these prices in the amounts disclosed in
Level 1 of the hierarchy. The Company receives the quoted market prices from third party, nationally recognized pricing services. When quoted market prices are unavailable, the Company utilizes
these pricing services to determine an estimate of fair value. The fair value estimates provided from these pricing services are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. If
quoted market prices and an estimate from a pricing service are unavailable, the Company produces an estimate of fair value based on internally developed valuation techniques, which, depending on the
level of observable market inputs, will render the fair value estimate as Level 2 or Level 3. The Company bases all of its estimates of fair value for assets on the bid price as it
represents what a third-party market participant would be willing to pay in an arm's length transaction.

Fixed Maturities

The Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for approximately 98% of its fixed maturities at both
December 31, 2017 and 2016. The pricing service utilizes market quotations for fixed maturity securities that have quoted prices in active markets. Since fixed maturities other than U.S.
Treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the pricing service prepares estimates of fair value measurements for these securities using its proprietary pricing applications, which
include available relevant market information, benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing. Additionally, the pricing service uses an Option Adjusted Spread
model to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios.



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

The
pricing service evaluates each asset class based on relevant market information, relevant credit information, perceived market movements and sector news. The market inputs utilized
in the pricing evaluation, listed in the approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids,
offers, reference data, and industry and economic events. The extent of the use of each market input depends on the asset class and the market conditions. Depending on the security, the priority of
the use of inputs may change or some market inputs may not be relevant. For some securities, additional inputs may be necessary.

The
pricing service utilized by the Company has indicated that it will only produce an estimate of fair value if there is objectively verifiable information to produce a valuation. If
the pricing service discontinues pricing an investment, the Company would be required to produce an estimate of fair value using some of the same methodologies as the pricing service but would have to
make assumptions for any market-based inputs that were unavailable due to market conditions. The Company reviews the estimates of fair value provided by the pricing service and compares the estimates
to the Company's knowledge of the market to determine if the estimates obtained are representative of the prices in the market. In addition, the Company has periodic discussions with the pricing
service to discuss and understand any changes in process and their responsiveness to changes occurring in the markets. The Company also monitors all monthly price changes and further evaluates any
securities whose value changed more than 10% from the prior month. The Company has implemented various other processes including randomly selecting purchased or sold securities and comparing execution
prices to the estimates from the pricing service as well as reviewing securities whose valuation did not change from their previous valuation (stale price review). The Company also uses a second
independent pricing service to further test the primary pricing service's valuation of the Company's fixed maturity portfolio. These processes have not highlighted any significant issues with the fair
value estimates received from the primary pricing service.

The
fair value estimates of most fixed maturity investments are based on observable market information rather than market quotes. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such fixed
maturities, other than U.S. Treasury securities, provided by the pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The estimated fair value of U.S. Treasury
securities is included in the amount disclosed in Level 1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.

The
Company also holds certain fixed maturity investments which are not priced by the pricing service and, accordingly, estimates the fair value of such fixed maturities using an
internal matrix that is based on market information regarding interest rates, credit spreads and liquidity. The underlying source data for calculating the matrix of credit spreads relative to the U.S.
Treasury curve are observable market-based indices that relate to corporate and high-yield fixed maturity investments. The Company includes the fair value estimates of these corporate bonds in
Level 2, since all significant inputs are market observable.

While
the vast majority of the Company's fixed maturities are included in Level 2, the Company holds a number of municipal bonds and corporate bonds which are not valued by the
pricing service and estimates the fair value of these bonds using an internal pricing matrix with some unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation. Due to the limited amount of
observable market information, the Company includes the fair value estimates for these particular bonds in Level 3. The fair value of the fixed maturities for which the Company used an internal
pricing matrix was



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

4. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)

$127 million
and $99 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Additionally, the Company holds a small amount of other fixed maturity investments that have
characteristics that make them unsuitable for matrix pricing. For these fixed maturities, the Company obtains a quote from a broker (primarily the market maker). The fair value of the fixed maturities
for which the Company received a broker quote was $77 million and $85 million at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Due to the disclaimers on the quotes that indicate that
the price is indicative only, the Company includes these fair value estimates in Level 3.

Equity Securities—Public Common Stock and Non-Redeemable Preferred Stock

For public common stock and non-redeemable preferred stocks, the Company receives prices from pricing services that are based on observable
market transactions and includes these estimates in the amount disclosed in Level 1. When current market quotes in active markets are
unavailable for certain non-redeemable preferred stocks held by the Company, the Company receives an estimate of fair value from the pricing services. The services utilize similar methodologies to
price the non-redeemable preferred stocks as they do for the fixed maturities. The Company includes the fair value estimate for these non-redeemable preferred stocks in the amount disclosed in
Level 2.

Other Investments

The Company holds investments in various publicly-traded securities which are reported in other investments. These investments include mutual
funds and other small holdings. The $19 million and $17 million fair value of these investments at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was disclosed in Level 1. At
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company held investments in non-public common and preferred equity securities, with fair value estimates of $38 million and $36 million,
respectively, reported in other investments, where the fair value estimate is determined either internally or by an external fund manager based on recent filings, operating results, balance sheet
stability, growth and other business and market sector fundamentals. Due to the significant unobservable inputs in these valuations, the Company includes the total fair value estimate for all of these
investments at December 31, 2017 and 2016 in the amount disclosed in Level 3.

The
Company utilized a pricing service and other market observable inputs to estimate fair value for approximately 97% and 99% of short-term securities at December 31, 2017 and
2016, respectively. A description of the process and inputs used by the pricing service to estimate fair value is discussed in the "

Fixed Maturities

"
section above. Estimates of fair value for U.S. Treasury securities and money market funds are based on market quotations received from the pricing service and are disclosed in Level 1 of the
hierarchy. The fair value of other short-term fixed maturity securities is estimated by the pricing service using observable market inputs and is disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. For
short-term securities where an estimate is not obtained from the pricing service, the carrying value approximates fair value and is included in Level 3 of the hierarchy.

The
Company utilized a pricing service to estimate fair value for 100% of its debt, including commercial paper, at December 31, 2017 and 2016. The pricing service utilizes market
quotations for debt that have quoted prices in active markets. Since fixed maturities other than U.S. Treasury securities generally do not trade on a daily basis, the fair value estimates are based on
market observable inputs and disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy.

The
Company had no material assets or liabilities that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

5. REINSURANCE

The Company's consolidated financial statements reflect the effects of assumed and ceded reinsurance transactions. Assumed reinsurance refers to the acceptance of certain insurance risks
that other insurance companies have underwritten. Ceded reinsurance involves transferring certain insurance risks (along with the related written and earned premiums) the Company has underwritten to
other



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

5. REINSURANCE (Continued)

insurance
companies who agree to share these risks. The primary purpose of ceded reinsurance is to protect the Company, at a cost, from losses in excess of the amount it is prepared to accept and to
protect the Company's capital. Reinsurance is placed on both a quota-share and excess-of-loss basis. Ceded reinsurance arrangements do not discharge the Company as the primary insurer, except for
instances where the primary policy or policies have been novated, such as in certain structured settlement agreements.

The
Company utilizes a corporate catastrophe excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty with unaffiliated reinsurers to manage its exposure to losses resulting from catastrophes and to protect
its capital. In addition to the coverage provided under this treaty, the Company also utilizes catastrophe bonds to protect against certain weather-related and earthquake losses in the Northeastern
United States, and a Northeast catastrophe reinsurance treaty to protect against losses resulting from weather-related and earthquake catastrophes in the Northeastern United States. The Company also
utilizes excess-of-loss treaties to protect against earthquake losses up to a certain threshold in Business Insurance (for certain markets) and for Personal Insurance, and several reinsurance treaties
specific to its international operations.

The
Company monitors the financial condition of its reinsurers under voluntary reinsurance arrangements to evaluate the collectability of amounts due from reinsurers and as a basis for
determining the reinsurers with which the Company conducts ongoing business. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Company may become involved in coverage disputes with its reinsurers.
Some of these disputes could result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against the reinsurers to determine the Company's rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. The
Company employs dedicated specialists and strategies to manage reinsurance collections and disputes.

Included
in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to involuntary reinsurance arrangements. The Company is required to participate in various involuntary reinsurance arrangements
through assumed reinsurance, principally with regard to residual market mechanisms in workers' compensation and automobile insurance, as well as homeowners' insurance in certain coastal areas. In
addition, the Company provides services for several of these involuntary arrangements (mandatory pools and associations) under which it writes such residual market business directly, then cedes 100%
of this business to the mandatory pool. Such participations and servicing arrangements are arranged to mitigate credit risk to the Company, as any ceded balances are jointly backed by all the pool
members.

Also
included in reinsurance recoverables are amounts related to certain structured settlements. Structured settlements are annuities purchased from various life insurance companies to
settle certain personal physical injury claims, of which workers' compensation claims comprise a significant portion. In cases where the Company did not receive a release from the claimant, the
structured settlement is included in reinsurance recoverables and the related claim cost is included in the liability for claims and
claim adjustment expense reserves, as the Company retains the contingent liability to the claimant. If it is expected that the life insurance company is not able to pay, the Company would recognize an
impairment of the related reinsurance recoverable if, and to the extent, the purchased annuities are not covered by state guaranty associations. In the event that the life insurance company fails to
make the required annuity payments, the Company would be required to make such payments.

Terrorism Risk Insurance Program

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Program is a Federal program administered by the Department of the Treasury authorized through December 31,
2020 that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for certain insured losses resulting from certified acts of terrorism.

In
order for a loss to be covered under the program (subject losses), the loss must meet certain aggregate industry loss minimums and must be the result of an event that is certified as
an act of terrorism by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General of the United States. The annual aggregate industry loss
minimum under the program is $160 million for 2018, but will increase over the life of the program to

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

5. REINSURANCE (Continued)

$200 million
by December 31, 2020. The program excludes from participation the following types of insurance: Federal crop insurance, private mortgage insurance, financial guaranty
insurance, medical malpractice insurance, health or life insurance, flood insurance, reinsurance, commercial automobile, professional liability (other than directors' and officers'), surety, burglary
and theft, and farm-owners multi-peril. In the case of a war declared by Congress, only workers' compensation losses are covered by the program. All commercial property and casualty insurers licensed
in the United States are generally required to participate in the program. Under the program, a participating insurer, in exchange for making terrorism insurance available, is entitled to be
reimbursed by the Federal Government for 82% of subject losses in 2018, after an insurer deductible, subject to an annual cap. This reimbursement percentage will decrease over the remaining three-year
life of the program to 80% of subject losses by December 31, 2020.

The
deductible for any calendar year is equal to 20% of the insurer's direct earned premiums for covered lines for the preceding calendar year. The Company's estimated deductible under
the program is $2.46 billion for 2018. The annual cap limits the amount of aggregate subject losses for all participating insurers to $100 billion. Once subject losses have reached the
$100 billion aggregate during a program year, participating insurers will not be liable under the program for additional covered terrorism losses for that program year. There have been no
terrorism-related losses that have triggered program coverage since the program was established. Since the law is untested, there is substantial uncertainty as to how it will be applied if an act of
terrorism is certified under the program. It is also possible that future legislative action could change or eliminate the program. Further, given the unpredictable frequency and severity of terrorism
losses, as well as the limited terrorism coverage in the Company's own reinsurance program, future losses from acts of terrorism, particularly involving nuclear, biological, chemical or radiological
events, could be material to the Company's operating results, financial position and/or liquidity in future periods. In addition, the Company may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims
arising from a high frequency of high severity natural catastrophes and/or of man-made catastrophic events involving conventional means. While the Company seeks to manage its exposure to man-made
catastrophic events involving conventional means, the Company may not have sufficient resources to respond to claims arising out of one or more man-made catastrophic events involving nuclear,
biological, chemical or radiological means.

On
August 4, 2017, the Company acquired Simply Business for strategic opportunities related to the potential growth of the small commercial business market
through advancements in its product and underwriting technology, including a distribution model that provides the capability to better assess and prepare for the demands of small business owners who
prefer to shop, purchase and service their insurance needs online. At December 31, 2017, goodwill related to the acquisition of Simply Business was $354 million. The total amount of
goodwill expected to be deductible for tax purposes related to Simply Business is $466 million, which includes certain acquisition costs and intangible assets.

Contract-based
intangible assets subject to amortization are comprised of fair value adjustments on claims and claim adjustment expense reserves, reinsurance
recoverables and other contract-related intangible assets. Customer-related intangible assets were not material as of December 31, 2016. Fair value adjustments recorded in connection with
insurance acquisitions were based on management's estimate of nominal claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. The method used calculated a risk adjustment to a
risk-free discounted reserve that would, if reserves ran off as expected, produce results that yielded the assumed cost-of-capital on the capital supporting the loss reserves. The fair value
adjustments are reported as other intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheet, and the amounts measured in accordance with the acquirer's accounting policies for insurance contracts have been
reported as part of the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves and reinsurance recoverables. The intangible assets are being recognized into income over the expected payment pattern. Because the
time value of money and the risk adjustment (cost of capital) components of the intangible assets run off at different rates, the amount recognized in income may be a net benefit in some periods and a
net expense in other periods.

Amortization
expense of intangible assets was $13 million, $11 million and $26 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Intangible asset amortization expense is estimated to be $15 million in 2018, $14 million in 2019, $13 million in 2020, $12 million in 2021 and $11 million in 2022.

Amount
represents acquired net claims and claim adjustment expense reserves of Travelers Participações em Seguros Brasil S.A. at
October 1, 2015.

Gross
claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at December 31, 2017 increased by $1.70 billion over December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of
(i) catastrophe losses in the second half of 2017 and (ii) higher volumes of insured exposures and loss cost trends for the current accident year, partially offset by the impacts of
(iii) payments related to operations in runoff and (iv) net favorable prior year reserve development. Gross claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at December 31, 2016
decreased by $343 million from December 31, 2015, primarily reflecting the impacts of (i) payments related to operations in runoff, including the Company's $524 million
payment related to the settlement of the PPG Industries, Inc. litigation and (ii) net favorable prior year reserve development, partially
offset by the impact of (iii) higher volumes of insured exposures and loss cost trends for the current accident year.

Reinsurance
recoverables on unpaid losses at December 31, 2017 increased by $142 million over December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting the impacts of catastrophe
losses and the asbestos reserve increase in the second half of 2017, partially offset by cash collections in 2017, including the settlement of certain disputes as discussed in more detail in
note 16. Reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses at December 31, 2016 decreased by $468 million from December 31, 2015, primarily reflecting the impact of cash
collections in 2016, including the settlement of a reinsurance dispute which is discussed in more detail in note 16.

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)

Included
in the claims and claim adjustment expense reserves are reserves for long-term disability and annuity claim payments, primarily arising from workers' compensation insurance and
workers' compensation excess insurance policies, that are discounted to the present value of the estimated future payments. The discount rate used was 5% at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.
Total reserves net of the discount were $2.32 billion and $2.17 billion, and the related amount of discount was $1.10 billion and $1.08 billion, at December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively. Accretion of the discount is reported as part of "claims and claim adjustment expenses" in the consolidated statements of income and was $50 million, $50 million
and $51 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Prior Year Reserve Development

The following disclosures regarding reserve development are on a "net of reinsurance" basis.


In 2017, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $458 million of net favorable development for claims arising in
prior years, including $592 million of net
favorable prior year reserve development and $50 million of accretion of discount that impacted the Company's results of operations.

Business Insurance.

Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 totaled $439 million, primarily driven by net favorable
prior year
reserve development in the segment's domestic operations due to better than expected loss experience in (i) the workers' compensation product line for multiple accident years, (ii) the
general liability product line (excluding an increase to asbestos and environmental reserves) for both primary and excess coverages for multiple accident years and (iii) the commercial
multi-peril product line for liability coverages for multiple accident years, partially offset by (iv) a $225 million increase to asbestos reserves, (v) the impact of higher than
expected loss experience in the commercial automobile product line for recent accident years and (vi) a $65 million increase to environmental reserves. The net favorable prior year
reserve development in the segment's domestic operations was partially offset by net unfavorable prior year reserve development in the segment's international operations in Europe primarily due to the
U.K. Ministry of Justice's "Ogden" discount rate adjustment applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts.

Bond & Specialty Insurance.

Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 totaled $140 million, primarily driven
by better than
expected loss experience in the segment's domestic operations in the general liability product line for multiple accident years.

Personal Insurance.

Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2017 was not significant and totaled $13 million.


In 2016, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $680 million of net favorable development for claims arising in
prior years, including $771 million of net favorable prior year reserve development and $50 million of accretion of discount that impacted the Company's results of operations.



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)

Business Insurance.

Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 totaled $424 million, primarily driven by better than
expected loss
experience in the Company's domestic operations in (i) the workers' compensation product line for multiple accident years and (ii) the general liability product line (excluding an
increase to asbestos and environmental reserves), related to both primary and excess coverages for multiple accident years, partially offset by (iii) a $225 million increase to asbestos
reserves and (iv) an $82 million increase to environmental reserves, as well as net favorable prior year reserve development in the segment's international operations in Europe.

Bond & Specialty Insurance.

Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2016 totaled $350 million, primarily driven by
better than
expected loss experience in the Company's domestic operations in (i) the fidelity and surety product line for multiple accident years and (ii) the general liability product line for
multiple accident years.

Personal Insurance.

Net unfavorable prior year reserve development in 2016 was not significant and totaled $3 million.


In 2015, estimated claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred included $817 million of net favorable development for claims arising in
prior years, including $941 million of net favorable prior year reserve development and $51 million of accretion of discount that impacted the Company's results of operations.

Business Insurance.

Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015 totaled $332 million, primarily driven by better than
expected loss
experience in the Company's domestic operations in (i) the general liability product line (excluding increases to asbestos and environmental reserves), for both primary and
excess coverages for multiple accident years, (ii) the workers' compensation line of business for accident years 2006 and prior, (iii) the property product line related to catastrophe
losses for recent accident years and non-catastrophe losses for recent accident years, partially offset by (iv) a $224 million increase to asbestos reserves and (v) a
$72 million increase to environmental reserves, as well as net favorable prior year reserve development in the Company's operations at Lloyd's.

Bond & Specialty Insurance.

Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015 totaled $281 million, primarily driven
by better than
expected loss experience in the Company's domestic operations in the fidelity and surety product line for multiple accident years, which was partially driven by a reduction in outstanding exposures
related to the financial crisis that commenced in 2007.

Personal Insurance.

Net favorable prior year reserve development in 2015 totaled $328 million, primarily driven by better than
expected loss
experience in the Company's domestic operations in (i) the Homeowners and Other product line for liability coverages for recent accident years, for non-catastrophe weather-related losses and
non-weather-related losses for accident year 2014 and (ii) the Automobile product line for liability coverages for recent accident years, as well as in the Company's international operations in
Canada.

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)

Methodology for Estimating Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) Reserves

Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves represent management's estimate of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment
expenses for claims that have been reported and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported as of the balance sheet date. Claims and claim adjustment expense reserves do not represent an exact
calculation of the liability, but instead represent management estimates, primarily utilizing actuarial expertise and projection methods that develop estimates for the ultimate cost of claims and
claim adjustment expenses. Because the establishment of claims and claims adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates and judgment, currently estimated claims
and claim adjustment expense reserves may change. The Company reflects changes to the reserves in the results of operations in the period the estimates are changed.

Cumulative
amounts paid and case reserves held as of the balance sheet date are subtracted from the estimate of the ultimate cost of claims and claim adjustment expenses to derive
incurred but not reported (IBNR) reserves. Accordingly, IBNR reserves include the cost of unreported claims, development on known claims and re-opened claims. This approach to estimating IBNR reserves
has been in place for many years, with no material changes in methodology in the past year.

Detailed
claim data is typically insufficient to produce a reliable indication of the initial estimate for ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year. As a
result, the initial estimate for an accident year is generally based on an exposure-based method using either the loss ratio projection or the expected loss method. The loss ratio projection method,
which is typically used for guaranteed-cost business, develops an initial estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year by multiplying earned premium for the accident
year by a projected loss ratio. The projected loss ratio is determined by analyzing prior period experience, and adjusting for loss cost trends, rate level differences, mix of business changes and
other known or observed factors influencing the accident year relative to prior accident years. The expected loss method, which is typically used for loss sensitive business, develops an initial
estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses for an accident year by analyzing exposures by account.

For
prior accident years, the following estimation and analysis methods are principally used by the Company's actuaries to estimate the ultimate cost of claims and claim adjustment
expenses. These estimation and analysis methods are typically referred to as conventional actuarial methods.

•

The paid loss development method assumes that the future change (positive or negative) in cumulative paid losses for a given cohort of claims
will occur in a stable, predictable pattern from year-to-year, consistent with the pattern observed in past cohorts.

•

The case incurred development method is the same as the paid loss development method but is based on cumulative case-incurred losses rather
than paid losses.

•

The Bornhuetter-Ferguson method uses an initial estimate of ultimate losses for a given product line reserve component, typically expressed as
a ratio to earned premium. The method assumes that the ratio of additional claim activity to earned premium for that component is relatively stable and predictable over time and that actual claim
activity to date is not a credible predictor of further activity for that component. The method is used most often for more recent accident years where claim data is sparse and/or volatile, with a
transition to other methods as the underlying claim data becomes more voluminous and therefore more credible.



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)

•

The average value analysis combined with the reported claim development method assumes that average claim values are stable and predictable
over time for a particular cohort of claims. It is typically limited to analysis at more granular levels, such as coverage or hazard/peril, where a more homogeneous subset of claims produce a more
stable and fairly predictable average value. The reported claim development method is the same as the paid loss development method but uses changes in cumulative claim counts to produce estimates of
ultimate claim counts rather than ultimate dollars. The resulting estimate of ultimate claim counts by cohort is multiplied by an average value per claim from an average value analysis to obtain
estimated ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses.

While
these are the principal methods utilized, the Company's actuaries have available to them the full range of actuarial methods developed by the casualty actuarial profession. The
Company's actuaries are also continually monitoring developments within the profession for advances in existing techniques or the creation of new techniques that might improve current and future
estimates. Most actuarial
methods assume that past patterns demonstrated in the data will repeat themselves in the future. For certain reserve components where this assumption may not hold, such as asbestos and environmental
reserves, conventional actuarial methods are not utilized by the Company.

Methodology for Determining Cumulative Number of Reported Claims

A claim file is created when the Company is notified of an actual demand for payment, notified of an event that may lead to a demand for payment
or when it is determined that a demand for payment could possibly lead to a future demand for payment on another coverage on the same policy or on another policy. Claim files are generally created for
a policy at the claimant by coverage level, depending on the particular facts and circumstances of the underlying event.

For
Business Insurance and for Personal Insurance, claim file information is summarized such that the Company generally recognizes one count for each policy claim event by internal
regulatory line of business, regardless of the number of claimants or coverages involved. The claims counts are then accumulated and reported by product line. While the methodology is generally
consistent within each segment for the product lines displayed, there are some minor differences between and within segments. For Bond & Specialty Insurance, the Company recognizes one count
per coverage per policy claim event.

For
purposes of the claims development tables above, claims reported for direct business are counted even if they eventually close with no loss payment, except in the case of
(i) deductible business, where the claim is not counted until the case incurred claim estimate is above the deductible, and (ii) International-Canada reported claim counts where claims
closed with no loss payment are not counted. Note that claims with zero claim dollars may still generate some level of claim adjustment expenses. Claim counts for assumed business are included only to
the extent such counts are available. The Company generally does not receive claim count information for which the underlying claim activity is handled by others, including pools and associations. The
Company does not generate claim counts for ceded business. The methods used to summarize claim counts have not changed significantly over the time periods reported in the tables above.

The
Company cautions against using the summarized claim count information provided in this disclosure in attempting to project ultimate loss payouts by product line. The Company
generally finds claim count data to be useful only on a more granular basis than the aggregated basis disclosed in the



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

claim
development tables above, as the risks, average values and other dynamics of the claim process can vary materially by the cause of loss and coverage within product line. For example, in Personal
Automobile, the introduction of a new roadside assistance coverage feature several years ago resulted in a significant increase in claim counts with a low average claim cost. For this reason the
Company varies its approach to, and in many cases the level of aggregation for, counting claims for internal analysis purposes depending on the particular granular analysis performed.

Asbestos and Environmental Reserves

At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company's claims and claim adjustment expense reserves included $1.64 billion and
$1.71 billion, respectively, for asbestos and environmental-related claims, net of reinsurance.

It
is difficult to estimate the reserves for asbestos and environmental-related claims due to the vagaries of court coverage decisions, plaintiffs' expanded theories of liability, the
risks inherent in complex litigation and other uncertainties, including, without limitation, those which are set forth below.

Asbestos Reserves.

Because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues, the Company generally reviews the
exposure presented
by each policyholder at least annually. Among the factors which the Company may consider in the course of this review are: available insurance coverage, including the role of any umbrella or excess
insurance the Company has issued to the policyholder; limits and deductibles; an analysis of the policyholder's potential liability; the jurisdictions involved; past and anticipated future claim
activity and loss development on pending claims; past settlement values of similar claims; allocated claim adjustment expense; potential role of other insurance; the role, if any, of non-asbestos
claims or potential non-asbestos claims in any resolution process; and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any, including the determination as to whether or not an asbestos claim is a
products/completed operation claim subject to an aggregate limit and the available coverage, if any, for that claim.

In
the third quarter of 2017, the Company completed its annual in-depth asbestos claim review, including a review of active policyholders and litigation cases for potential product and
"non-product" liability, and noted the continuation of the following trends:

•

a high level of litigation activity in certain jurisdictions involving individuals alleging serious asbestos-related illness, primarily
involving mesothelioma claims;

•

while overall payment patterns have been generally stable, there has been an increase in severity for certain policyholders due to a high level
of litigation activity; and

•

a moderate level of asbestos-related bankruptcy activity.

In
the Home Office and Field Office category, which accounts for the vast majority of policyholders with active asbestos-related claims, the number of policyholders tendering asbestos
claims for the first time and the number of policyholders with open asbestos claims declined slightly when compared to 2016 while gross asbestos-related payments were higher. Payments on behalf of
policyholders in this category continue to be influenced by a high level of litigation activity in a limited number of jurisdictions where individuals alleging serious asbestos-related injury,
primarily



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)

mesothelioma,
continue to target defendants who were not traditionally primary targets of asbestos litigation.

The
Company's quarterly asbestos reserve reviews include an analysis of exposure and claim payment patterns by policyholder category, as well as recent settlements, policyholder
bankruptcies, judicial rulings and legislative actions. The Company also analyzes developing payment patterns among policyholders in the Home Office and Field Office, and Assumed Reinsurance and Other
categories as well as projected reinsurance billings and recoveries. In addition, the Company reviews its historical gross and net loss and expense paid experience, year-by-year, to assess any
emerging trends, fluctuations, or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid activity. Conventional actuarial methods are not utilized to establish asbestos reserves and the Company's evaluations
have not resulted in a reliable method to determine a meaningful average asbestos defense or indemnity payment.

The
completion of these reviews and analyses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 resulted in $225 million, $225 million and $224 million increases, respectively, in the Company's
net asbestos reserves. In each year, the reserve increases were primarily driven by increases in the Company's estimate of projected settlement and defense costs related to a broad number of
policyholders in the Home Office category due to a higher than previously anticipated level of litigation activity surrounding mesothelioma claims. This increase in the estimate of projected
settlement and defense costs resulted from payment trends that continue to be higher than previously anticipated due to the impact of the current litigation environment discussed above. Over the past
decade, the property and casualty insurance industry, including the Company, has experienced net unfavorable prior year reserve development with regard to asbestos reserves, but the Company believes
that over that period there has been a reduction in the volatility associated with the Company's overall asbestos exposure as the overall asbestos environment has evolved from one dominated by
exposure to significant litigation risks, particularly coverage disputes relating to policyholders in bankruptcy who were asserting that their claims were not subject to the aggregate limits contained
in their policies, to an environment primarily driven by a frequency of litigation related to individuals with mesothelioma. The Company's overall view of the current underlying asbestos environment
is essentially unchanged from recent periods and there remains a high degree of uncertainty with respect to future exposure to asbestos claims.

Net
asbestos paid loss and loss expenses in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $271 million, $708 million and $770 million, respectively. Net payments in 2016 included the
$458 million net payment related to PPG Industries, Inc. Net payments in 2015 included the $502 million payment related to the settlement of asbestos direct action litigation.
Approximately 4%, 69% and 69% of total net paid losses in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to policyholders with whom the Company had entered into settlement agreements limiting the
Company's liability.

Environmental Reserves.

In establishing environmental reserves, the Company evaluates the exposure presented by each policyholder and
the anticipated
cost of resolution, if any. In the course of this analysis, the Company generally considers the probable liability, available coverage and relevant judicial interpretations. In addition, the Company
considers the many variables presented, such as: the nature of the alleged activities of the policyholder at each site; the number of sites; the total number of potentially responsible parties at each
site; the nature of the alleged environmental harm and the corresponding remedy at each site; the nature of government enforcement activities at each site; the ownership and general use of each site;
the overall nature of the insurance relationship between the Company and the policyholder, including the role of any umbrella or excess insurance the Company



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)

has
issued to the policyholder; the involvement of other insurers; the potential for other available coverage, including the number of years of coverage; the role, if any, of non-environmental claims
or potential non-environmental claims in any resolution process; and the applicable law in each jurisdiction. The evaluation of the exposure presented by a policyholder can change as information
concerning that policyholder and the many variables presented is developed. Conventional actuarial methods are not used to estimate these reserves.

The
Company continues to receive notices from policyholders tendering claims for the first time, frequently under policies issued prior to the mid-1980s. These policyholders continue to
present smaller exposures, have fewer sites and are lower tier defendants. Further, in many instances, clean-up costs have been reduced because regulatory agencies are willing to accept risk-based
site analyses and more efficient clean-up technologies. Over the past several years, the Company has experienced generally favorable trends in the number of new policyholders tendering environmental
claims for the first time and in the number of pending declaratory judgment actions relating to environmental matters. However, the degree to which those favorable trends have continued has been less
than anticipated. In addition, reserve development on existing environmental claims has been greater than anticipated, driven by claims and legal developments in a limited number of jurisdictions. As
a result of these factors, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company increased its net environmental reserves by $65 million, $82 million and $72 million, respectively.

Asbestos and Environmental Reserves.

As a result of the processes and procedures discussed above, management believes that the reserves
carried for
asbestos and environmental claims are appropriately established based upon known facts, current law and management's judgment. However, the uncertainties surrounding the final resolution of these
claims continue, and it is difficult to determine the ultimate exposure for asbestos and environmental claims and related litigation. As a result, these reserves are subject to revision as new
information becomes available and as claims develop. The continuing uncertainties include, without limitation, the risks and lack of predictability inherent in complex litigation, any impact from the
bankruptcy protection sought by various asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants, a further increase or decrease in the cost to resolve, and/or the number of, asbestos and environmental claims
beyond that which is anticipated, the emergence of a greater number of asbestos claims than anticipated as a result of extended life expectancies resulting from medical advances and lifestyle
improvements, the role of any umbrella or excess policies the Company has issued, the resolution or adjudication of disputes pertaining to the amount of available coverage for asbestos and
environmental claims in a manner inconsistent with the Company's previous assessment of these claims, the number and outcome of direct actions against the Company, future developments pertaining to
the Company's ability to recover reinsurance for asbestos and environmental claims and the unavailability of other insurance sources potentially available to policyholders, whether through exhaustion
of policy limits or through the insolvency of other participating insurers. In addition, uncertainties arise from the insolvency or bankruptcy of policyholders and other defendants. It is also not
possible to predict changes in the legal, regulatory and legislative environment and their impact on the future development of asbestos and environmental claims. This environment could be affected by
changes in applicable legislation and future court and regulatory decisions and interpretations, including the outcome of legal challenges to legislative and/or judicial reforms establishing medical
criteria for the pursuit of asbestos claims. It is also difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of complex coverage disputes until settlement negotiations near completion and significant legal
questions are resolved or, failing settlement, until the dispute is



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

7. INSURANCE CLAIM RESERVES (Continued)

adjudicated.
This is particularly the case with policyholders in bankruptcy where negotiations often involve a large number of claimants and other parties and require court approval to be effective.
As part of its continuing analysis of asbestos and environmental reserves, the Company continues to study the implications of these and other developments.

Because
of the uncertainties set forth above, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company's current reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of claims and
claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or increases in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that
could be material to the Company's operating results in future periods.

Catastrophe Exposure

The Company has geographic exposure to catastrophe losses, which can be caused by a variety of events, including, among others, hurricanes,
tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can
also result from terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of
infrastructure. The incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable. The extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in the area
affected by the event and the severity of the event. Most catastrophes are restricted to small geographic areas; however, hurricanes and earthquakes may produce significant damage in larger areas,
especially those that are heavily populated. The Company generally seeks to mitigate its exposure to catastrophes through individual risk selection and the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance.

There
are also risks which impact the estimation of ultimate costs for catastrophes. For example, the estimation of reserves related to hurricanes can be affected by the inability of the
Company and its insureds to access portions of the impacted areas, the complexity of factors contributing to the losses, the legal and regulatory uncertainties and the nature of the information
available to establish the reserves. Complex factors include, but are not limited to: determining whether damage was caused by flooding versus wind; evaluating general liability and pollution
exposures; estimating additional living expenses; the impact of demand surge; the potential impact of changing climate conditions, including higher frequency and severity of weather-related events;
infrastructure disruption; fraud; the effect of mold damage and business income interruption costs; and reinsurance collectibility. The timing of a catastrophe's occurrence, such as at or near the end
of a reporting period, can also affect the
information available to the Company in estimating reserves for that reporting period. The estimates related to catastrophes are adjusted as actual claims emerge.

Description of Debt

Commercial Paper

—The Company maintains an $800 million commercial paper program, supported by a $1.0 billion bank credit agreement that
expires on June 7, 2018. (See "Credit Agreement" discussion that follows.) Interest rates on commercial paper issued in 2017 ranged from 0.65% to 1.17%, and in 2016 ranged from 0.35% to 0.55%.

Senior Notes

—The Company's various senior debt issues are unsecured obligations that rank equally with one another. Interest payments are made
semi-annually. The Company generally may redeem some or all of the notes prior to maturity in accordance with terms unique to each debt instrument.

Junior Subordinated Debentures

—The Company's three junior subordinated debenture instruments are all similar in nature to each other. Three separate
business trusts issued preferred securities to investors and used the proceeds to purchase the Company's junior subordinated debentures. Interest on each of the instruments is paid semi-annually.

The
Company's consolidated balance sheet includes the debt instruments acquired in a business acquisition, which were recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date. The resulting
fair value adjustment is being amortized over the remaining life of the respective debt instruments using the effective-interest method. The amortization of the fair value adjustment reduced interest
expense by $1 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The
following table presents merger-related unamortized fair value adjustments and the related effective interest rate:

Credit Agreement

The Company is party to a five-year, $1.0 billion revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that expires on
June 7, 2018. Pursuant to the credit agreement covenants, the Company must maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, defined as shareholders' equity determined in accordance with GAAP plus
(a) trust preferred securities (not to exceed 15% of total capital) and (b) mandatorily convertible securities (combined with trust preferred securities, not to exceed 25% of total
capital) less goodwill and other intangible assets, of $13.73 billion. In addition, the credit agreement contains other customary restrictive covenants as well as certain customary events of
default, including with respect to a change in control, which is defined to include the acquisition of 35% or more of the Company's voting stock and certain changes in the composition of the Company's
board of directors. At December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. Generally, the cost of borrowing under this agreement will range from LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points
to LIBOR plus 150 basis points, depending on the Company's credit ratings. At December 31, 2017, that cost would have been LIBOR plus 112.5 basis points, had there been any amounts outstanding
under the credit agreement. This credit agreement also supports the Company's commercial paper program.

Shelf Registration

The Company has a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that expires on June 17, 2019 which
permits it to issue securities from time to time at prices and on other terms to be determined at the time of offering.

9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY

Authorized Shares

The number of authorized shares of the Company is 1.755 billion, consisting of five million shares of preferred stock,
1.745 billion shares of voting common stock and five million undesignated shares. The Company's Articles of Incorporation authorize the Board of Directors to establish, from the undesignated
shares, one or more classes and series of shares, and to further designate the type of shares and terms thereof.

Preferred Stock

The Company's Articles of Incorporation provide authority to issue up to five million shares of preferred stock.

Common Stock

The Company is governed by the Minnesota Business Corporation Act. All authorized shares of voting common stock have no par value. Shares of
common stock reacquired are considered authorized and unissued shares.



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY (Continued)

Restricted Stock

In August 2017, the Company issued 95,953 shares of restricted stock valued at approximately $12 million in connection with a business
acquisition to certain employees of the acquired business. The restricted stock is subject to service conditions and as such is recognized as share-based compensation; 50% of the restricted stock will
vest two years from the issuance date and the remainder will vest three years from the issuance date. The value will be recognized over the respective vesting periods and included with the share-based
compensation cost of awards that are issued under the Company's share-based incentive compensation plan (see note 13). The recipients generally have all the rights of a shareholder of the
Company including the right to vote the applicable shares of common stock and to receive dividends on such shares, if and as declared by the Board of Directors. The restricted stock is held under the
Company's control with the Company's transfer agent and will be released upon vesting.

Treasury Stock

The Company's Board of Directors has approved common share repurchase authorizations under which repurchases may be made from time to time in
the open market, pursuant to pre-set trading plans meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, in private transactions or otherwise. The authorizations do
not have a stated expiration date. The timing and actual number of shares to be repurchased in the future will depend on a variety of factors, including the Company's financial position, earnings,
share price, catastrophe losses, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the Company's desired ratings from independent rating agencies, funding of the Company's qualified pension plan, capital
requirements of the Company's operating subsidiaries, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, other investment opportunities (including mergers and acquisitions and related financings), market
conditions and other factors. In April 2017, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization that added an additional $5.0 billion of repurchase capacity. The following table
summarizes repurchase activity in 2017 and remaining repurchase capacity at December 31, 2017.

The
Company's Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan and the Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Incentive Plan provide settlement alternatives to employees in which the Company
retains shares to cover payroll withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of restricted stock unit awards and performance share awards, and to cover the price of certain stock options that were
exercised. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company acquired $62 million and $72 million, respectively, of its common stock under these plans.

Common
shares acquired are reported as treasury stock in the consolidated balance sheet.

9. SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND DIVIDEND AVAILABILITY (Continued)

Dividend Availability

The Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries, domiciled principally in the State of Connecticut, are subject to various regulatory restrictions
that limit the maximum amount of dividends available to be paid by each insurance subsidiary to its respective parent company without prior approval of insurance regulatory authorities. A maximum of
$2.66 billion is available by the end of 2018 for such dividends to the holding company, TRV, without prior approval of the Connecticut Insurance Department. The Company may choose to
accelerate the timing within 2018 and/or increase the amount of dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in 2018, which could result in certain dividends being subject to approval by the Connecticut
Insurance Department.

In
addition to the regulatory restrictions on the availability of dividends that can be paid by the Company's U.S. insurance subsidiaries, the maximum amount of dividends that may be
paid to the Company's shareholders is limited, to a lesser degree, by certain covenants contained in its line of credit agreement with a syndicate of financial institutions that require the Company to
maintain a minimum consolidated net worth as described in note 8.

TRV
is not dependent on dividends or other forms of repatriation from its foreign operations to support its liquidity needs. The undistributed earnings of the Company's foreign
operations are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations, and such earnings were not material to the Company's financial position or liquidity at December 31, 2017.

TRV
and its two non-insurance holding company subsidiaries received dividends of $2.33 billion, $3.05 billion and $3.75 billion from their U.S. insurance
subsidiaries in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

For
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, TRV declared cash dividends per common share of $2.83, $2.62 and $2.38, respectively, and paid cash dividends of
$785 million, $757 million and $739 million, respectively.

Statutory Net Income and Statutory Capital and Surplus

Statutory net income of the Company's domestic and international insurance subsidiaries was $2.30 billion, $3.20 billion and
$3.80 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Statutory capital and surplus of the Company's domestic and international insurance subsidiaries was
$20.45 billion and $20.76 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Basic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The
computation of diluted earnings per share reflected the effect of potentially dilutive securities.

12. INCOME TAXES

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) which, among other changes, reduced the U.S. federal tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning on
January 1, 2018 and imposed a tax on undistributed and previously untaxed post-1986 foreign earnings and profits (accumulated foreign earnings). The estimated effects of enactment of TCJA are
reflected in the net deferred tax asset and current tax liability that are reported on the Company's balance sheet at December 31, 2017.

The
Company paid income taxes of $514 million, $892 million and $1.21 billion during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
current income tax refundable of $65 million at December 31, 2017 was included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet. The current income tax payable of $72 million at
December 31, 2016 was included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.

In
computing taxable income, property and casualty insurers reduce underwriting income by claims and claim adjustment expenses incurred. The deduction for claims incurred is discounted
at the interest rates and for the claim payment patterns prescribed by the U.S. Treasury. TCJA changes the prescribed interest rates to rates based on corporate bond yield curves and extends the
applicable time periods for the claim payment pattern. These changes are effective for tax years beginning after 2017 and are subject to a transition rule that spreads the additional tax payment from
the amount determined by applying these changes over the subsequent eight years beginning in 2018. This item is a taxable temporary difference and has no direct impact on total tax expense for 2017
and future years. The required additional tax payments are currently estimated to approximate $70 million per year over the eight-year period and will result in a modest reduction in net
investment income. The Company's tax payments will reflect the amounts due under the transition rule beginning in 2018.

If
the Company determines that any of its deferred tax assets will not result in future tax benefits, a valuation allowance must be established for the portion of these assets that are
not expected to be realized. The net change in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was an increase of $3 million in 2017 relating to the Company's consolidated Brazilian subsidiary.
Based upon a review of the Company's anticipated future taxable income, and also including all other available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company's management concluded that it is more
likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized.

For
tax return purposes, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards in Brazil and the United Kingdom. The amount and timing of realizing the
benefits of NOL carryforwards depend on future taxable income and limitations imposed by tax laws. Only the benefits of the United Kingdom NOL carryforwards have been recognized in the consolidated
financial statements and are included in net deferred tax assets. The NOL amounts by jurisdiction and year of expiration are as follows:

December
2017. These undistributed foreign earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in those operations.

The
Company has recorded provisional amounts for the tax imposed on accumulated foreign earnings and partnership investments, as well as the amount due under the transition rule relating
to the change in discounting of claims incurred, based on information available at December 31, 2017. As a result of
the Company's normal U.S. income tax return preparation process, the Company expects taxes related to accumulated foreign earnings and partnerships to be adjusted as final earnings from foreign
operations and partnership investments (Form K-1's) are received in 2018 for preparation of the Company's 2017 U.S. income tax return that will be filed in 2018. The amounts payable under the
transition rules related to discounting have been estimated but are subject to change once the U.S. Treasury issues guidance sometime in 2018. Adjustments to temporary differences will result from the
reduced income tax rate applied to the deferred taxes associated with these items. Provisional amounts may also be adjusted to the extent future clarifications of TCJA are provided.

Included
in the balances at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $3 million and $7 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect
the annual effective tax rate. Also included in the balances at those dates were $3 million and $6 million, respectively, of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is
certain, but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of deductibility. The timing of such deductibility could affect the annual effective tax rate depending on the year of deduction and tax
rate at the time.

The
Company recognizes accrued interest and penalties, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits in income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, the
Company recognized approximately $(33) million, $31 million and $(32) million in interest, respectively. The Company had approximately $25 million and $57 million accrued for the
payment of interest at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

The
IRS has completed examinations of the Company's U.S. income tax returns for all years through 2014. The Company does not expect any significant changes to its liability for
unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months.

13. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

The Company has a share-based incentive compensation plan, The Travelers Companies, Inc. Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2014 Incentive Plan), the purposes of
which are to align
the interests of the Company's non-employee directors, executive officers and other employees with those of the Company's shareholders and to attract and retain personnel by providing incentives in
the form of share-based awards. The 2014 Incentive Plan permits grants of nonqualified stock options, incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units,
deferred stock, deferred stock units, performance awards and other share-based or share-denominated awards with respect to the Company's common stock. The Company has a policy of issuing new shares to
settle the exercise of stock option awards and the vesting of other equity awards.

In
connection with the adoption of the 2014 Incentive Plan, The Travelers Companies, Inc. Amended and Restated 2004 Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the 2004 Incentive Plan) was
terminated, joining several other legacy share-based incentive compensation plans that had been terminated in prior years (together, the legacy plans). Outstanding grants were not affected by the
termination of the legacy plans. The 2014 Incentive Plan is currently the only plan pursuant to which future stock-based awards may be granted.

The
number of shares of the Company's common stock initially authorized for grant under the 2014 Incentive Plan was 10 million shares. In May 2017 and 2016, the Company's
shareholders authorized an additional 2.5 million and 4.4 million shares of the Company's common stock, respectively, for grant under the 2014 Incentive Plan. The following are not
counted towards the combined 16.9 million shares available and will be available for future grants under the 2014 Incentive Plan: (i) shares of common stock subject to awards that expire
unexercised, that are forfeited, terminated or canceled, that are settled in cash or other forms of property, or otherwise do not result in the issuance of shares of common stock, in whole or in part;
(ii) shares that are used to pay the exercise price of stock options and shares used to pay withholding taxes on awards generally; and (iii) shares purchased by the Company on the open
market using cash option exercise proceeds; provided, however, that the increase in the number of shares of common stock available for grant pursuant to such market purchases shall not be greater than
the number that could be repurchased at fair market value on the date of exercise of the stock option giving rise to such option proceeds. In addition, the 16.9 million shares authorized by
shareholders for issuance under the 2014 Incentive Plan will be increased by any shares subject to awards under the 2004 Incentive Plan that were outstanding as of May 27, 2014 and subsequently
expire, are forfeited, canceled, settled in cash or otherwise terminate without the issuance of shares.

The
Company also has a compensation program for non-employee directors (the Director Compensation Program). Under the Director Compensation Program, non-employee directors' compensation
consists of an annual retainer, a deferred stock award, committee chair fees and a lead director fee. Each non-employee director may choose to receive all or a portion of his or her annual retainer in
the form of cash or deferred stock units which vest upon grant. The annual deferred stock awards vest in full one day prior to the date of the Company's annual meeting of shareholders occurring in the
year following the year of the grant date, subject to continued service. The deferred stock awards, including dividend equivalents, accumulate until distribution either in a lump sum six months after
termination of service as a director or, if the director so elects, in annual installments beginning at least six months following termination of service as a director. The deferred stock units issued
under the Director Compensation Program are awarded under the 2014 Incentive Plan.



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

13. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (Continued)

Stock Option Awards

Stock option awards granted to eligible officers and key employees have a ten-year term. All stock options are granted with an exercise price
equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The stock options granted generally vest upon meeting certain years of service criteria. Except as the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors may allow in the future, stock options cannot be sold or transferred by the participant. Stock options outstanding under the 2014 Incentive Plan and the 2004
Incentive Plan generally vest three years after grant date (cliff vest).

The
fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant by application of a variation of the Black-Scholes option pricing model using the assumptions noted in the following
table. The expected term of newly granted stock options is the time to vest plus half the remaining time to expiration. This considers the vesting restriction and represents an even pattern of
exercise behavior over the remaining term. The expected volatility assumption is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock for the same period as the estimated option term
generally using the volatility of the week prior to the stock option grant. The expected dividend is based upon the Company's current quarter dividend annualized and assumed to be constant over the
expected option term. The risk-free interest rate for each option is the interpolated market yield of a U.S. Treasury bill with a term comparable to the expected option term for the same week used for
measuring volatility. The following table provides information about options granted:

awards for which the requisite service has been rendered, including those that are retirement eligible.

On
February 6, 2018, the Company, under the 2014 Incentive Plan, granted 1,632,361 stock option awards with an exercise price of $140.85 per share. The fair value attributable to the
stock option awards on the date of grant was $20.13 per share.

Restricted Stock Units, Deferred Stock Units and Performance Share Award Programs

The Company issues restricted stock unit awards to eligible officers and key employees under the Equity Awards program established pursuant to
the 2014 Incentive Plan. A restricted stock unit represents the right to receive a share of common stock. These restricted stock unit awards are granted at market price, generally vest three years
from the date of grant, do not have voting rights and the underlying shares of common stock are not issued until the vesting criteria is satisfied. In addition, the Company's board of directors can be
issued deferred stock units from (i) an annual award; (ii) deferred compensation (in lieu of cash retainer); and (iii) dividend equivalents earned on outstanding deferred
compensation.

The
Company also has a Performance Share Awards Program established pursuant to the 2004 Incentive Plan and which continues pursuant to the 2014 Incentive Plan. Under the program, the
Company may issue performance share awards to certain employees of the Company who hold positions of Vice President (or its equivalent) or above. The performance share awards provide the recipient the
right to earn shares of the Company's common stock based upon the Company's attainment of certain performance goals and the recipient meeting certain years of service criteria. The performance goals
for performance share awards are based on the Company's adjusted return on equity over a three-year performance period. Vesting of performance shares is contingent upon the Company attaining the
relevant performance period minimum threshold return on equity and the recipient meeting certain years of service criteria, generally three years for full vesting, subject to proration for certain
termination conditions. If the performance period return on equity is below the minimum threshold, none of the performance shares will vest. If performance meets or exceeds the minimum

performance
threshold, a range of performance shares will vest (50% to 150% for awards granted in 2016, 2017 and 2018), depending on the actual return on equity attained.

The
fair value of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance shares is measured at the market price of the Company stock at date of grant. Under terms of the 2014

shares of restricted common stock were also issued outside of the 2014 Incentive Plan in connection with the acquisition of Simply Business which remain
unvested and are not included in this table. See note 9.

In
addition to the nonvested shares presented in the above table, there are related nonvested dividend equivalent shares. The number of nonvested dividend equivalent shares related to
deferred stock units was 408 at the beginning of the year and 379 at the end of the year and the number of nonvested dividend equivalent shares related to performance shares was 28,480 at the
beginning of the year and
26,584 at the end of the year. The dividend equivalent shares are subject to the same vesting terms as the deferred stock units and performance shares.

On
February 6, 2018, the Company, under the 2014 Incentive Plan, granted 805,432 common stock awards in the form of restricted stock units, deferred stock units and performance share
awards to participating officers, non-employee directors and other key employees. The restricted stock units and deferred stock units totaled 486,024 shares while the performance share awards totaled
319,408 shares. The fair value per share attributable to the common stock awards on the date of grant was $140.85.

13. SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE COMPENSATION (Continued)

Share-Based Compensation Cost Recognition

The amount of compensation cost for awards subject to a service condition is based on the number of shares expected to be issued and is
recognized over the time period for which service is to be provided (requisite service period). Awards granted to retiree-eligible employees or to employees who become retiree-eligible before an
award's vesting date are considered to have met the requisite service condition. The compensation cost for awards subject to a performance condition is based upon the probable outcome of the
performance condition, which on the grant date reflects an estimate of attaining 100% of the performance shares granted. The compensation cost reflects an estimated annual forfeiture rate from 3.0% to
4.0% over the requisite service period of the awards. That estimate is revised if subsequent information indicates that the actual number of instruments expected to vest is likely to differ from
previous estimates. Compensation costs for awards are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For awards that have graded vesting terms, the compensation cost is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for each separate vesting portion of the award as if the award was, in substance, multiple awards. The total compensation cost for
all share-based incentive compensation awards recognized in earnings for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $136 million, $155 million and $141 million,
respectively. Included in these amounts are compensation cost adjustments of $3 million, $11 million and $8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,
respectively, that reflected the cost associated with the updated estimate of performance shares due to attaining certain performance levels from the date of the initial grant of the performance
awards. The related tax benefits recognized in earnings were $45 million, $52 million and $47 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

At
December 31, 2017, there was $143 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested share-based incentive compensation awards. This includes stock
options, restricted and
deferred stock units and performance shares granted under the 2014 Incentive Plan and the 2004 Incentive Plan and restricted common stock issued in connection with a 2017 business acquisition. The
unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. Cash received from the exercise of employee stock options under share-based compensation
plans totaled $173 million and $332 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The tax benefit for tax deductions from employee stock options exercised during 2017 and 2016 totaled
$31 million and $58 million, respectively.

14. PENSION PLANS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND SAVINGS PLANS

The Company sponsors a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan (the qualified domestic pension plan), which covers substantially all U.S. domestic employees and provides
benefits under a cash balance formula, except that certain limited groups of legacy participants are covered by a prior traditional final average pay formula. In addition, the Company sponsors a
nonqualified defined benefit pension plan which covers certain highly-compensated employees, pension plans for employees of its foreign subsidiaries, and a postretirement health and life insurance
benefit plan for employees satisfying certain age and service requirements and for certain retirees.

The
total accumulated benefit obligation for the Company's defined benefit pension plans was $3.77 billion and $3.48 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively. The qualified domestic pension plan accounted for $3.55 billion and $3.26 billion of the total accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2017 and 2016,
respectively, whereas the nonqualified and foreign plans accounted for $0.22 billion of the total accumulated benefit obligation at both December 31, 2017 and 2016.

For
pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets, the aggregate projected benefit obligation was $0.2 billion at both December 31, 2017 and
2016, and the aggregate accumulated benefit obligation was $0.2 billion at both December 31, 2017 and 2016. The fair value of plan assets for the above plans was $0.1 billion at
both December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The
Company has discretion regarding whether to provide additional funding and when to provide such funding to its qualified domestic pension plan. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, there were no
required contributions to the qualified domestic pension plan. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, the Company voluntarily made contributions totaling $300 million, $200 million and
$100 million, respectively, to the qualified domestic pension plan. There is no required contribution to the qualified domestic pension plan during 2018, and the Company has not determined
whether or not additional funding will be made during
2018. With respect to the Company's foreign pension plans, there are no significant required contributions in 2018.

In
2016, the Company began using a full yield-curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for its qualified and
nonqualified domestic pension plans and its domestic postretirement benefit plans. The full yield-curve approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve that the Company used to
determine its projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year to the projected cash flows related to service and interest costs. Previously, the Company estimated these service and interest
cost components by applying a single weighted-average discount rate derived from this yield curve. This change was made to provide a better estimate of the service and interest cost components of net
periodic benefit costs, consistent with the methodology used to estimate the projected benefit obligation for each of the benefit plans.

This
change did not affect the measurement of the Company's total benefit obligations as the change in the service cost and interest cost is completely offset in the actuarial (gain)
loss reported for the period. The change reduced the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit costs for 2016 by $6 million and $30 million, respectively, and resulted
in an $0.08 increase in diluted net income per share for 2016. The weighted average discount rates that were used to measure service and interest costs during 2016 were 4.77% and 3.64%, respectively,
for the domestic qualified pension plan, 4.53% and 3.47%, respectively, for the domestic nonqualified pension plan and 0.00% and 3.53%, respectively, for the domestic postretirement benefit plan. The
discount rate associated with the service cost component of the domestic postretirement benefit plan is zero as it is a closed plan and all participants are fully vested. Under the Company's prior
estimation approach, the weighted average discount rate for both the service and interest cost components would have been 4.50% for the domestic qualified pension plan, 4.37% for the domestic
nonqualified pension plan and 4.35% for the domestic postretirement benefit plan. The Company accounted for this change as a change in estimate, and accordingly, recognized the effect prospectively
beginning in 2016.

For
the defined benefit pension plans, the estimated net actuarial loss that will be reclassified (amortized) from accumulated other comprehensive income into net income as part of net
periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is $91 million and the estimated prior service benefit to be

14. PENSION PLANS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND SAVINGS PLANS (Continued)

amortized
over the next fiscal year is $1 million. For the postretirement benefit plans, the estimated net actuarial gain that will be reclassified (amortized) from accumulated other
comprehensive income into net income as part of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year is less than $1 million, and the estimated prior service benefit to be amortized over the
next fiscal year is $4 million.

The
discount rate assumption used to determine the

benefit obligation

is based on a yield-curve approach. Under this approach, individual
spot rates from the yield curve of a hypothetical portfolio of



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

14. PENSION PLANS, RETIREMENT BENEFITS AND SAVINGS PLANS (Continued)

high
quality fixed maturity corporate bonds (rated Aa) available at the year-end valuation date, for which the timing and amount of cash outflows correspond with the timing and amount of the estimated
benefit payouts of the Company's benefit plan, are applied to expected future benefits payments in measuring the projected

benefit obligation

. The
discount rate assumption used to determine

benefit obligations

disclosed above represents the weighted average of the individual spot rates.

The
discount rate assumption used to determine the

net periodic benefit cost

is the single weighted average discount rate derived from the
yield curve used to measure the

benefit obligation

at the beginning of the year.

In
choosing the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company selected the rate that was set as the return objective by the Company's Benefit Plans Investment Committee,
which had considered the historical returns of equity and fixed maturity markets in conjunction with prevailing economic and financial market conditions.

As
an indicator of sensitivity, increasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% would have increased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $22 million at
December 31, 2017, and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense by $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
Decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by 1% would have decreased the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2017 by $19 million and the aggregate of
the service and interest cost components of net postretirement benefit expense by $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The
assumptions made for the Company's foreign pension and foreign postretirement benefit plans are not materially different from those of the Company's qualified domestic pension plan
and the domestic postretirement benefit plan.

Plan Assets

The qualified domestic pension plan assets are invested for the exclusive benefit of the plan participants and beneficiaries and are intended,
over time, to satisfy the benefit obligations under the plan. Risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial position. The asset
mix guidelines have been established and are reviewed quarterly. These guidelines are intended to serve as tools to facilitate the investment of plan assets to maximize long-term total return and the
ongoing oversight of the plan's investment performance. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through daily and monthly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability
measurements and periodic asset/liability studies.

The
Company's overall investment strategy for the qualified domestic pension plan is to achieve a mix of approximately 85% to 90% of investments for long-term growth and 10% to 15% for
near-term benefit payments with a diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current target allocations for plan assets are 55% to 65% equity securities and 20% to 40%
fixed income securities, with the remainder allocated to short-term securities. Equity securities primarily include investments in large, medium and small-cap companies primarily located in the United
States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities and debt securities issued by foreign
governments.

Assets
of the Company's foreign pension plans are not significant.

Fair Value Measurement—Pension Plans and Other Postretirement Benefit Assets

For a discussion of the methods employed by the Company to measure the fair value of invested assets, see note 4. The following
discussion of fair value measurements applies exclusively to the Company's pension plans and other postretirement benefit assets.

Fair
value estimates for equity and bond mutual funds held by the pension plans reflect prices received from an external pricing service that are based on observable market transactions.
These estimates are included in Level 1.

Short-term
securities are carried at fair value which approximates cost plus accrued interest or amortized discount. The fair value or market value of these is periodically compared to
this amortized cost and is based on significant observable inputs as determined by an external pricing service. Accordingly, the estimates of fair value for such short-term securities, other than U.S.
Treasury securities and money market mutual funds, provided by an external pricing service are included in the amount disclosed in Level 2 of the hierarchy. The estimated fair value of U.S.
Treasury securities and money market mutual funds is included in the amount disclosed in Level 1 as the estimates are based on unadjusted market prices.

Fair Value Hierarchy—Pension Plans

The following tables present the level within the fair value hierarchy at which the financial assets of the Company's pension plans are measured
on a recurring basis.

Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company's overall investment strategy is to achieve a mix of approximately 35% to 65% of investments for long-term growth and 35% to 60% for
near-term insurance payments with a wide diversification of asset types, fund strategies and fund managers. The current target allocations for plan assets are 25% to 75% fixed income securities, with
the remainder allocated to short-term securities. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities and U.S. Treasuries.

Fair Value—Other Postretirement Benefit Plans

The Company's other postretirement benefit plans had financial assets of $13 million and $14 million at December 31, 2017
and 2016, respectively, which are measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The assets are primarily corporate bonds and short-term securities and categorized as level 2 in the fair value
hierarchy.

Savings Plan

The Company has a savings plan, The Travelers 401(k) Savings Plan (the Savings Plan), in which substantially all U.S. domestic Company employees
are eligible to participate. Under the Savings Plan, the Company matches employee contributions up to 5% of eligible pay, with a maximum annual match of $6,500 which becomes 100% vested after three
years of service. The Company's matching contribution is made in cash and invested according to the employee's current investment elections and can be reinvested into other investment options in
accordance with the terms of the plan. The Company's non-U.S. employees participate in separate savings plans. The total expense related to all of the savings plans was $119 million,
$114 million and $109 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

All
common shares held by the Savings Plan are considered outstanding for basic and diluted EPS computations and dividends paid on all shares are charged to retained earnings.

15. LEASES

Rent expense was $188 million, $197 million and $202 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Future
minimum annual rental payments under noncancellable operating leases for 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 are $130 million, $108 million, $91 million,
$75 million and $51 million, respectively, and $103 million for 2023 and thereafter. Future sublease rental income aggregating approximately $4 million will partially
offset these commitments.

16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

Contingencies

The major pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which the Company or any of its
subsidiaries is a party or to which any of the Company's properties is subject are described below.



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (Continued)

Asbestos and Environmental Claims and Litigation

In the ordinary course of its insurance business, the Company has received and continues to receive claims for insurance arising under policies
issued by the Company asserting alleged injuries and damages from asbestos- and environmental-related exposures that are the subject of related coverage litigation. The Company is defending asbestos-
and environmental-related litigation vigorously and believes that it has meritorious defenses; however, the outcomes of these disputes are uncertain. In this regard, the Company employs dedicated
specialists and comprehensive resolution strategies to manage asbestos and environmental loss exposure, including settling litigation under appropriate circumstances. Currently, it is not possible to
predict legal outcomes and their impact on the future development of claims and litigation relating to asbestos and environmental claims. Any such development will be affected by future court
decisions and interpretations, as well as changes in applicable legislation. Because of these uncertainties, additional liabilities may arise for amounts in excess of the Company's current insurance
reserves. In addition, the Company's estimate of ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses may change. These additional liabilities or changes in estimates, or a range of either, cannot now be
reasonably estimated and could result in income statement charges that could be material to the Company's results of operations in future periods.

Other Proceedings Not Arising Under Insurance Contracts or Reinsurance Agreements

The Company is involved in other lawsuits, including lawsuits alleging extra-contractual damages relating to insurance contracts or reinsurance
agreements, that do not arise under insurance contracts or reinsurance agreements. The legal costs associated with such lawsuits are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred. Based upon
currently available information, the Company does not believe it is reasonably possible that any such lawsuit or related lawsuits would be material to the Company's results of operations or would have
a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or liquidity.

Gain Contingency

On August 17, 2010, in a reinsurance dispute in New York state court captioned

United States Fidelity &
Guaranty Company v. American Re-Insurance Company, et al.

, the trial court granted summary judgment for United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF&G), a subsidiary of the
Company, and denied summary judgment for the reinsurers. The Court of Appeals largely affirmed the entry of summary judgment, but remanded two discrete issues for trial.

On
November 7, 2016, the Company agreed to a settlement with one of the three defendants then remaining in this dispute. The Company received payment under the settlement in the
fourth quarter of 2016 and, as a result, recognized a $126 million pre-tax ($82 million after-tax) gain in the fourth quarter, which was included in "other revenues" in the consolidated
statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. In connection with that settlement, the reinsurance recoverable balance related to this case was reduced from approximately
$238 million to approximately $31 million in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. At March 31, 2017, the claim related to the remaining defendants totaled $71 million,
comprising the $31 million of reinsurance recoverable plus interest amounting to $40 million as of that date. The interest was treated for accounting purposes as a gain contingency in
accordance with FASB Topic 450,

Contingencies

, and accordingly was not recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements.



THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

16. CONTINGENCIES, COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES (Continued)

On
May 1, 2017, the Company agreed to a settlement of this dispute with the two remaining defendants, along with the settlement of several other disputes with these same parties.
As a result of the settlement of all of these matters, the Company recorded an immaterial gain in "other revenues" in its consolidated statement of income for the three months ended June 30,
2017, and the reinsurance recoverable of $31 million in the Company's balance sheet was fully satisfied.

Other Commitments and Guarantees

Commitments

Investment Commitments

—The Company has unfunded commitments to private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships in which it invests.
These commitments totaled $1.56 billion and $1.60 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Guarantees

In the ordinary course of selling businesses to third parties, the Company has agreed to indemnify purchasers for losses arising out of breaches
of representations and warranties with respect to the businesses being sold, covenants and obligations of the Company and/or its subsidiaries and, in certain cases, obligations arising from certain
liabilities. Such indemnification provisions generally are applicable from the closing date to the expiration of the relevant statutes of limitations, although, in some cases, there may be agreed upon
term limitations or no term limitations. Certain of these contingent obligations are subject to deductibles which have to be incurred by the obligee before the Company is obligated to make payments.
The maximum amount of the Company's contingent
obligation for indemnifications related to the sale of businesses that are quantifiable was $358 million at December 31, 2017, of which $2 million was recognized on the balance
sheet at that date.

The
Company also has contingent obligations for guarantees related to certain investments, third-party loans related to certain investments, certain insurance policy obligations of
former insurance subsidiaries and various other indemnifications. The Company also provides standard indemnifications to service providers in the normal course of business. The indemnification clauses
are often standard contractual terms. The maximum amount of the Company's obligation for guarantees of certain investments and third-party loans related to certain investments that are quantifiable
was $45 million at December 31, 2017, approximately $23 million of which is indemnified by a third party. The maximum amount of the Company's obligation related to the guarantee
of certain insurance policy obligations of a former insurance subsidiary was $480 million at December 31, 2017, all of which is indemnified by a third party.

Certain
of the guarantees and indemnifications described above have no stated or notional amounts or limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and, accordingly, the Company is
unable to provide an estimate of the maximum potential payments for such arrangements.

17. NONCASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES

There were no material noncash financing or investing activities during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

18. CONSOLIDATING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE TRAVELERS COMPANIES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

The following consolidating financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X. These consolidating financial statements have
been prepared from the Company's financial information on the same basis of accounting as the consolidated financial statements. The Travelers Companies, Inc. (excluding its subsidiaries, TRV)
has fully and unconditionally guaranteed certain debt obligations of Travelers Property Casualty Corp. (TPC) and Travelers Insurance Group Holdings, Inc. (TIGHI), which totaled
$700 million at December 31, 2017.

Prior
to the merger of TPC and The St. Paul Companies, Inc. in 2004, TPC fully and unconditionally guaranteed the payment of all principal, premiums, if any, and interest
on certain debt obligations of its wholly-owned subsidiary, TIGHI. Concurrent with the merger, TRV fully and unconditionally assumed such guarantee obligations of TPC. TPC is deemed to have no assets
or operations independent of TIGHI. Consolidating financial information for TIGHI has not been presented herein because such financial information would be substantially the same as the financial
information provided for TPC.

Income
tax expense for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 included a net charge of $129 million to reflect the change in tax laws and tax rates enacted
in the U.S. on December 22, 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, resulting primarily from revaluing the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities and the tax imposed on
accumulated foreign earnings.

Due
to the use of an average number of shares for each quarter, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share may not equal the total earnings per share for the full
year.



Item 9.    CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE

Not Applicable.

Item 9A.    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can
provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company's management, with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer,
has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2017. Consistent with guidance issued by the SEC that an
assessment of internal controls over financial reporting of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, management is excluding an
assessment of such internal controls for Simply Business from its evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures. The Company acquired all of the issued and
outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings Ltd (Simply Business) on August 4, 2017. Simply Business represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated total assets, consolidated
total revenues and net income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. Based upon that evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer concluded that, as of December 31, 2017, the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable
assurance level.

In
addition, there was no change in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as that term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that
occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. The
Company is in the process of reviewing the internal control structure of Simply Business and, if necessary, will make appropriate changes as it continues to integrate Simply Business into the
Company's overall internal control over the financial reporting process.

The
Company regularly seeks to identify, develop and implement improvements to its technology systems and business processes, some of which may affect its internal control over financial
reporting. These changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems or platforms, automating manual processes or utilizing technology developed
by third parties. These systems changes are often phased in over multiple periods in order to limit the implementation risk in any one period, and as each change is implemented the Company monitors
its effectiveness as part of its internal control over financial reporting.



Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of
the Company in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company's accounting policies and internal controls over financial reporting, established and maintained by
management, are under the general oversight of the Company's Audit Committee.

The
Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:

•

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the Company;

•

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the Company's management and directors; and

•

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of assets that could have
a material effect on the financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management
has assessed the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. The standard measures adopted by management in making its evaluation are
the measures in the

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission.

Consistent
with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from management's report on internal control
over financial reporting in the year of acquisition, management excluded an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting related to Simply Business. The
Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Simply Business on August 4, 2017. Simply Business represented less than 1% of the Company's consolidated total assets, consolidated
total revenues and net income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Based
upon its assessment, management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective at December 31, 2017, and that there were no
material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of that date.

KPMG LLP,
an independent registered public accounting firm, which has audited and reported on the consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-K, has issued
its report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting which follows this report.



Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The
Shareholders and Board of Directors

The Travelers Companies, Inc.:

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

We have audited The Travelers Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries' (the "Company") internal control over financial reporting
as of December 31, 2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2017, based on criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission.

We
also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB"), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of
December 31, 2017 and 2016, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period
ended December 31, 2017, and the related notes and financial statement schedules as listed in the index to consolidated financial statements and schedules (collectively, the "consolidated
financial statements"), and our report dated February 15, 2018 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

The
Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Simply Business Holdings Ltd. (Simply Business) on August 4, 2017. Management excluded Simply Business
from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2017. Simply Business represented less than 1% of the Company's
consolidated total assets, consolidated total revenues and net income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also
excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Simply Business.

Basis for Opinion

The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its
assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with
respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit
also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting

A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over
financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future
periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Item 9B.    OTHER INFORMATION

Executive Ownership and Sales.

All of the Company's executive officers are subject to the Company's executive stock ownership policy.
For a summary
of this policy as currently in effect, see "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Stock Ownership Guidelines, Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policies, and Other Trading Restrictions" in the
Company's proxy statement filed with the SEC on March 31, 2017. From time to time, some of the Company's executives may determine that it is advisable to diversify their investments for
personal financial planning reasons, or may seek liquidity for other reasons, and may, in compliance with the stock ownership policy, sell shares of common stock of the Company on the open market, in
private transactions or to the Company. To effect such sales, from
time to time, some of the Company's executives may enter into trading plans designed to comply with the Company's Securities Trading Policy and the provisions of Rule 10b5-1 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The trading plans will not reduce any of the executives' ownership of the Company's shares below the applicable executive stock ownership guidelines. The Company does
not undertake any obligation to report Rule 10b5-1 plans that may be adopted by any employee or director of the Company in the future, or to report any modifications or termination of any
publicly announced plan.

As
of the date of this report, Jay S. Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, was the only "named executive officer" (i.e. an executive officer named in the compensation
disclosures in the Company's most recent proxy statement filed) that has entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that remains in effect. Under the Company's stock ownership guidelines,
Mr. Benet has a target ownership level established as the lesser of 30,000 shares or the equivalent value of 300% of base salary (as such amount is calculated for purposes of the stock
ownership guidelines). See "Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Stock Ownership Guidelines, Anti-Hedging and Pledging Policies, and Other Trading Restrictions" in the Company's proxy
statement filed with the SEC on March 31, 2017.

Consulting Agreement.

On February 13, 2018, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Brian MacLean, President and
Chief Operating
Officer. Mr. MacLean will officially retire from the Company effective April 2, 2018. Under the terms of the consulting agreement, Mr. MacLean will provide strategic and other
advice to the Company following his retirement and through March 31, 2019 for a fee of $50,000 per month. The foregoing summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the consulting
agreement, which is filed as Exhibit 10.7 to this report.

(Parent Company Only)

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT

1.     GUARANTEES

The Travelers Companies, Inc. (TRV) fully and unconditionally guarantees the payment of all principal, premiums, if any, and interest on certain debt
obligations of its subsidiaries TPC and TIGHI. The guarantees pertain to the $200 million 7.75% notes due 2026 and the $500 million 6.375% notes due 2033.

TRV
also has contingent obligations for guarantees in connection with the selling of businesses to third parties and various indemnifications including indemnifications to service
providers in the normal course of business. The guarantees and indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and include indemnifications for breaches of representations and warranties
and in some cases obligations arising from certain liabilities. The terms of these provisions vary in duration and nature. Certain of the guarantees and indemnifications described above have no stated
or notional amounts or limitation to the maximum potential future payments, and, accordingly, TRV is unable to provide an estimate of the maximum potential payments for such arrangements.
