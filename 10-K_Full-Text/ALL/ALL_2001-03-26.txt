Part I

Item 1.  Business

The Allstate Corporation (the "Parent") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding company for
Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and their affiliates (collectively, including the Parent,
"Allstate"). Allstate is engaged, principally in the United States and Canada, in the personal property and casualty insurance business and the life insurance and investment products business.
Allstate is the 2

nd

largest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 1999 statutory premiums earned and the nation's 13

th

largest life
insurance business based on ordinary life insurance in force and 21

st

based on statutory admitted assets. Allstate has four business segments: personal property and casualty; Allstate
Financial (our life insurance and investment products business); discontinued lines and coverages; and corporate and other business.

STRATEGY

Allstate's goal is to be a leading provider of personal financial services to targeted market segments using our multi-channel, multi-brand and multi-product
strategy. This strategy is intended to:

•

Focus
on the profitable growth of our personal property and casualty business and Allstate Financial

•

Capitalize
on the strength of the Allstate brand and our other brands such as Encompass

SM

Insurance and American Heritage Life

•

Serve
customers' needs and preferences by providing access to Allstate when, where and how they choose

•

Leverage
a variety of distribution and service channels, including Allstate exclusive agencies, independent agencies, other financial institutions, direct
response, the workplace and the Internet

In
pursuit of this strategy, we intend to seek expanded distribution channels, to offer new products and to engage in selective business start-ups, acquisitions and
partnerships.

While
pursuing this strategy, we intend to maintain discipline in our capital and expense management in order to create long-term stockholder value. The components of the
strategy applicable to our particular business segments are covered below in the discussion of the segments.


PERSONAL PROPERTY AND CASUALTY SEGMENT

Strategy

The personal property and casualty segment has adopted the following strategies:

•

Focus
on attracting and retaining customers who represent high lifetime value to Allstate's business, using strategic risk management (SRM), a multi-phase
strategy to integrate and optimize pricing, underwriting and marketing decisions

•

Improve
profitability by continuing to manage claim and underwriting costs, thereby limiting the effect of inflation and reducing the cost of doing
business

•

Improve
the profitability of under performing businesses such as our non-standard private passenger auto insurance business

•

Make
optimum use of Allstate's distribution and service channels by encouraging the growth of larger and stronger exclusive agencies and continuing the
roll-out and enhancement of The Good Hands

SM

Network

•

Create
and deploy technology to enhance the integration of Allstate's distribution channels, to improve customer service, to facilitate the introduction of
new products and services, and to reduce infrastructure costs related to supporting agencies and handling claims

Products

Allstate's personal property and casualty segment sells principally private passenger auto and homeowners insurance in the United States and other countries.
It accounted for 64.0% of our statutory written premiums in 2000.

Although
private passenger auto and homeowners insurance account for the majority of its business, the personal property and casualty segment writes many other lines of insurance,
including landlords, personal umbrella, renters, condominium, residential fire, mobile home, boat owners and selected commercial property and casualty. The segment also operates Allstate
Enterprises, Inc., whose principal subsidiary, Allstate Motor Club, Inc., provides members with travel plans and emergency road service.

We
evaluate the results of this segment based primarily upon underwriting results and premium growth.

Information
regarding the last three years' revenues and operating profit or loss attributable to the personal property and casualty segment is contained in Note 17 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page D-76 of Appendix D to the Proxy Statement. Note 17 also includes information regarding the last three years' identifiable
assets attributable to our property-liability operations. Note 17 is incorporated herein by reference.


Underwriting and Pricing

Historically we have separated both private passenger auto insurance and homeowners insurance into standard and non-standard categories for
underwriting and pricing purposes. While we have not abandoned the standard/non-standard categorization, we are in the process of implementing a refined program called strategic risk
management (SRM). SRM is a multi-phase strategy to integrate and optimize pricing, underwriting and marketing decisions. In pricing private passenger auto insurance for many states, SRM uses factors
such as the number of years of continuous coverage with a prior insurer, prior bodily injury liability limits and financial stability to generate a tier-based pricing model. In pricing for
homeowners insurance, it uses factors such as claim activity and financial stability. Tier-based pricing produces a range of premiums that is broader and more refined than the range
generated by the standard/non-standard model. As a result, we believe that tier-based pricing will allow Allstate to improve its competitive position in high lifetime value
market segments while improving profitability. We regard high lifetime value market segments as those that are most profitable over time due to a variety of factors, including our ability to retain
the business of customers in those segments and our ability to cross sell them multiple lines of insurance coverage. Because the homeowners insurance business is less price-sensitive than the private
passenger auto insurance business, new business growth attributable to SRM will occur more gradually in the homeowners business than in the auto business.

We
intend to continue to enhance SRM and to implement it throughout the U.S. for the Allstate brand as we complete the regulatory review process and as we perform additional analysis.
Currently SRM is in effect for the Allstate brand in 32 states for standard auto insurance, 34 states for non-standard auto insurance and 13 states for homeowners insurance. In addition, we intend to
adapt SRM for the Encompass and Deerbrook brands' business models and introduce those versions of SRM throughout the country for those brands.

We
have been pursuing various initiatives to address adverse profitability trends in our non-standard business. These initiatives vary by state but include changes such as additional
premium down-payment requirements, tightening of underwriting requirements, price increases, policy non-renewals (where permitted) and other administrative changes.

The
personal property and casualty segment participates in the "involuntary" or "shared" private passenger auto insurance business. This business provides auto insurance to higher
risk individuals who would otherwise be unable to obtain it. Allstate, like all auto insurers, is required to write or share the cost of this business as a condition of its license to do business in
many states. When the underwriting standards used by Allstate and other participants in the non-standard auto insurance business make it less likely that applicants can obtain non-standard policies,
the amount of business written by shared markets generally increases. Policies written in this market are generally priced at higher than standard rates. We have generally experienced losses in this
business.

As
is true for the industry in general, costs attributable to our personal property and


casualty products are generally higher during the first year an insurance policy is in effect than for subsequent years. Policies that remain in force generally become more profitable over time.
Accordingly, customer retention is an important factor in the segment's profitability and a key element of our strategy in this business.

Claims

Since 1993 the personal property and casualty segment has focused on managing its claim costs by redesigning its claim settlement procedures. This process has
entailed changes to procedures for auto physical damage claims, bodily injury claims and property claims. In 2001, we intend to take additional steps to address claim severity. These steps will
include loss management initiatives related to legal services, auto repair, glass, home furnishings and home repair as well as the ongoing use of medical management programs, special fraud detection
investigative units and defense strategies.

Distribution Methods

In November 1999 Allstate announced a new multi-access distribution and service model—The Good Hands Network—for some of its Allstate
brand personal property and casualty insurance products. In the states where it has been implemented, the network allows customers to shop for, buy and obtain service for certain Allstate personal
property and casualty insurance products through Allstate agencies, over the Internet and by telephone to customer information centers. These three distribution channels are integrated and
complementary, so that customers receive the same products, the same price and essentially the same service regardless of how they choose to access Allstate for a particular need.

The
Good Hands Network was available in the following states as of December 31, 2000—although Internet access was delayed in Georgia pending the implementation of a new
pricing model: Arizona, Alabama, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee and Virginia. By the end of 2001 we expect it to reach
substantially all of the U.S. population. To increase the effectiveness of The Good Hands Network, its launch in a particular state may be accompanied by targeted advertising campaigns.

In
2000 we reorganized our multiple employee agency programs into Allstate's exclusive agency independent contractor program. In addition, we began equipping Allstate agencies with
new technology that consolidates and provides information by household for a more complete profile of every customer's family. This technology is designed to assist agencies in their efforts to cross
sell Allstate products, to retain current customers, and to target and attract new customers.

Historically
and throughout 2000, we have sold our auto and homeowner products primarily through agencies, both Allstate exclusive agencies and independent agencies. Our broad-based
network of approximately 13,000 exclusive agencies in the United States in


approximately 10,000 locations produced 92.0% of the segment's written premiums in 2000. The balance was primarily generated by approximately 17,000 independent agencies.

In
order to increase premium revenue from the independent agent channel, we acquired the personal lines business of CNA Financial Corporation in October 1999. In September 2000 we
renamed this business "Encompass." With Encompass, we are the third largest provider of personal lines products through independent agencies in the United States, based on 1999 written premium.

The
personal property and casualty segment uses several brand identities, including Allstate, Encompass, Deerbrook and Pembridge. Currently, Allstate brand policies are sold through
exclusive Allstate agencies and, to a limited extent, through independent agencies. Encompass and Deerbrook policies are sold through independent agencies.

Geographic Markets

The personal property and casualty segment's principal geographic markets are in the United States. Through various Allstate affiliates, we are authorized to
sell various lines of personal property and casualty insurance in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Through various Allstate affiliates, we are also authorized in Canada, Germany and Italy.

The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums earned for the segment for the year ended December 31, 2000:

California

10.7

%

New York

10.4

%

Texas

9.9

%

Florida

9.3

%

Pennsylvania

4.9

%

No
other jurisdiction accounted for more than four percent of the statutory premiums for the personal property and casualty segment.

Allstate
has been selling private passenger auto insurance in Germany since 1997 and in Italy since 2000 through direct response marketing. In January 2000 we announced our
withdrawal from Japan. Our international businesses do not contribute significantly to financial results for this segment.

The
segment's underwriting strategy for homeowners is to target customers whose risk of loss provides Allstate with the best opportunity for profitable growth. This includes managing
exposure on policies in geographic areas where the potential loss from catastrophes exceeds acceptable levels.

The
personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance businesses are highly competitive. For the past several years, strongly capitalized competitors have been able to offer
relatively low prices. New competitors, particularly direct marketers, have been attracted to the insurance business by what were, until recently, growing profit margins. The expansion and
redefinition of underwriting risk selection and tolerance by many competitors have fueled the competitive environment. For these and other reasons, we expect the business to remain competitive.
However, the competitive pressure to lower prices is abating in the auto insurance business as the industry faces profit margins affected by factors such as higher jury awards, higher medical costs,
increased auto body repair costs (partly based
on the decreasing use of after-market parts and the corresponding increase in the use of original equipment manufacturer parts), the popularity of sport utility vehicles and higher car prices.

The
personal property and casualty segment competes principally on the basis of the recognition of its brands, the scope of its distribution system, price, the breadth of its product
offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, extensive use of our proprietary database of underwriting and pricing experience enables Allstate to
use SRM to divide the market into segments, appropriately price risks and cross sell its products within its customer base.

In
1999 in the United States insurance industry, approximately $51.13 billion of personal property and casualty premiums were generated by independent agencies. The remaining
$100.04 billion of premiums were generated by insurers placing their products directly with the consumer through employee agents, independent contractor exclusive agents and direct response
marketing. As stated above, Allstate is the third largest provider of personal lines products through independent agents in the United States, based on 1999 written premium.


Catastrophe Losses and Catastrophe Management

Information regarding catastrophe losses and management is incorporated herein by reference to the discussion of "PP&C Catastrophe Losses and Catastrophe
Management" beginning on page D-9 of Appendix D to the Proxy Statement.

ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT

Strategy

Allstate Financial has adopted the following strategies:

•

Become
consumer centric by understanding and meeting the needs of three consumer target groups: middle-income consumers with retirement needs; affluent,
relationship-oriented traditionalists who want to preserve and grow their savings; and moderate-income consumers who have family protection needs

•

Extend
the Allstate brand to more products and distribution channels

•

Broaden
and strengthen product distribution by focusing on channels and participants with the greatest sales and profit opportunity

•

Invest
in technology to drive Allstate's competitive advantage through innovation and quality in operational processes

•

Build
a high performance organization within Allstate Financial that consistently achieves superior results through strong leadership and execution

•

Expand
institutional products business to gain increased operating income and investment portfolio diversification

Products

The Allstate Financial segment markets a broad line of life insurance and investment products. Our life insurance products include whole life, traditional term
and interest sensitive life products, including variable life. Our investment products include fixed and variable annuities and products sold to institutions, including guaranteed investment
contracts, funding agreements and annuities. We continue to develop variations of our competitive fee-based and interest sensitive products in order to satisfy changing customer needs. We
evaluate Allstate Financial's results based primarily upon invested asset growth, separate account growth, face amounts of life policies in force, net income and return on required capital.

Life
insurance in force, net of reinsurance, for the segment was $242.43 billion at December 31, 2000 and $227.66 billion at December 31, 1999. As of
December 31, 2000, the segment had $40.25 billion of investments and $15.30 billion of separate account assets. In 2000, annuity premiums and deposits represented 64.3% of the
segment's total statutory premiums and deposits.

In
our efforts to meet the needs of Allstate Financial's three consumer target groups, we


have applied to the Office of Thrift Supervision to amend the charter of Allstate Bank so that, in addition to offering trust products and services, we can offer deposit and lending products and
services.

The
assets and liabilities relating to variable annuities, variable life, variable universal life and certain guaranteed investment contracts are legally segregated and reflected as
assets and liabilities of the separate accounts

.

Information
regarding the last three years' revenues, operating profit or loss, and identifiable assets attributable to the Allstate Financial segment is contained in Note 17
to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page D-76 of Appendix D to the Proxy Statement, incorporated herein by reference.

Distribution Methods

We distribute Allstate Financial's products through Allstate exclusive agencies, banks, independent agencies, securities firms, direct marketing, the Internet
and specialized brokers. We also use Allstate's life specialists and personal financial representatives, who provide professional financial planning services and are licensed to sell a variety of
investment and insurance products.

The
life specialist program will terminate on June 30, 2001. In order to continue selling Allstate Financial products and services, current life specialists must elect to
convert to exclusive financial specialists prior to June 1, 2001. While life specialists are employees of Allstate Insurance Company, exclusive financial specialists are usually independent
contractors.

Allstate
Financial offers products and services using the Allstate, Glenbrook, Northbrook, Lincoln Benefit and American Heritage Life brands. Generally, the segment sells Allstate
brand products through exclusive agencies, securities firms, direct marketing, the Internet and specialized brokers. It sells products under the other brands through both exclusive and independent
agencies, securities firms, banks and direct marketing. The products sold under the Glenbrook, Northbrook and Lincoln Benefit brands are similar to the types of products that the segment offers under
the Allstate brand. The American Heritage Life brand products include health and disability insurance in addition to life insurance and annuities. American Heritage Life products are generally sold
through workplace marketing. We believe that this multi-brand and multi-channel distribution strategy provides operating flexibility and allows Allstate Financial to focus on niche marketing while
minimizing the conflict inherent in maintaining multiple distribution channels.

We
have been expanding the distribution of Allstate Financial products by increasing cross sales to existing Allstate customers in the personal property and casualty segment and by
driving increased sales activity through stronger wholesaling efforts.

Over
the years we have established a variety of distribution arrangements for Allstate


Financial, including the following:

•

A
joint venture with Putnam Investments, Inc., a leading investment management company, to develop, market and distribute an Allstate and Putnam
co-branded variable insurance and annuity line. Putnam's portfolio managers oversee the mutual fund investments that are included as investment options in some of Allstate's variable
insurance products. The products are distributed by Putnam's wholesaling force and through its relationships with banks, securities firms and financial advisors. For the year ended December 31,
2000, the joint venture with Putnam produced statutory premiums and deposits of $1.98 billion, accounting for 16.1% of the segment's total statutory premiums and deposits for the year.

•

The
1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Insurance Company, a leading distributor of life, disability and health insurance to employees at their
workplaces. As part of its national expansion effort, in 2000 American Heritage Life acquired (through reinsurance) the payroll deduction universal life business of Great Southern Life Insurance
Company. The independent agents who produced this in force payroll deduction business were appointed to write new business on behalf of American Heritage Life.

•

The
formation of AFD, Inc., a broker dealer distribution company, to expand Allstate Financial's wholesaling of variable annuities and other
investment products through banks, independent broker dealers, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. and the AIM Mutual Fund Group.

•

The
Allstate Financial Services program. This program allows Allstate exclusive agents to earn the "personal financial representative" designation.
  The program is one of Allstate's responses to the strong demand for financial products. Personal financial representatives can provide professional financial planning, help their
customers with retirement planning, and sell fixed and variable annuities and mutual fund products—in addition to property and casualty and life insurance products. As of
December 31, 2000 approximately 25% of Allstate's exclusive agency force had already become personal financial representatives after passing limited securities license exams and completing the
Allstate training curriculum. We estimate that half of the Allstate exclusive agency force will become personal financial representatives by 2002. New Allstate exclusive agents are required to become
personal financial representatives within one year of being appointed by Allstate.

•

An
alliance between Northbrook Life Insurance Company and Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter & Co., for the marketing and distribution of
Northbrook's life and investment products exclusively through Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's Financial Advisors. For the year ended December 31, 2000, the Dean Witter alliance produced statutory
premiums and deposits of $1.05 billion, accounting for 8.6% of the segment's total statutory premiums and deposits.

•

Glenbrook
Life and Annuity Company's expanded relationship with the AIM Mutual Fund Group and Scudder Investor Services, now including AIM and Scudder
mutual funds as investment options on various Glenbrook variable investment products.

•

A
reinsurance agreement with PNC Bank Corp. whereby 50% of the business sold through PNC is reinsured to a PNC insurance affiliate.

•

Marketing
arrangements with various banks, securities firms and independent agencies for the sale of life and investment products.


Geographic Markets

The Allstate Financial segment's principal market is the United States, where we are authorized to sell life insurance in all 50 states and the District of
Columbia through various Allstate affiliates. We are also authorized to sell life insurance through various Allstate affiliates in Puerto Rico, Canada, Indonesia and the Philippines.

The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and deposits for the Allstate Financial segment for the year ended
December 31, 2000:

California

10.8

%

Florida

6.1

%

Pennsylvania

6.0

%

Illinois

4.7

%

New York

4.7

%

Nebraska

4.6

%

No
other jurisdiction accounted for more than four percent of the statutory premiums and deposits for the Allstate Financial segment.

Allstate
has been engaged in the life insurance business in Indonesia since 1998 and the Philippines since 1999 and maintains a representative office in China. Our international
businesses do not contribute significantly to our financial results. In November 2000 we sold our interest in Samshin Allstate Life Insurance Company and thereby discontinued our operations in
South Korea.

Competition

We believe that the combination of our product innovation, our relationships with well-known mutual fund managers, and our strong distributor
relationships give us a competitive advantage in the rapidly growing and changing market for life insurance and investment products.

Allstate
Financial competes principally on the basis of the scope of our distribution systems, breadth of product offerings, brand recognition, financial strength, product features,
price and customer service. In addition, with respect to variable life and investment products, we


compete on the basis of the variety of choices in our separate account portfolio of funds and the management and performance of those funds.

The
life insurance and annuity market continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2000, there were approximately 735 groups of life insurance
companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more products similar to those offered by the Allstate Financial segment and many of which used similar marketing techniques. Based on
information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments, in 1999 approximately 25.1% of the life insurance and annuity statutory premiums and deposits were written by six groups of
companies. The Allstate Financial segment ranked 13

th

based on ordinary life insurance in force and 21

st

based on statutory admitted assets. Banks and savings and loan
associations in certain jurisdictions compete with the segment in the sale of life insurance products. In addition, because certain life insurance and investment products include a savings or
investment component, competitors include securities firms, investment advisors, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions.

Allstate
Financial is currently facing increased competition. This is due, in part, to demutualization and consolidation activity in the life insurance industry. We expect this
competitive environment to continue.

Reserves

The establishment of reserve and contractholder fund liabilities in recognition of the segment's future benefit obligations under life and annuity policies and
other products are discussed in Notes 2 and 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on pages D-42 and D-60, respectively, of Appendix D to the Proxy
Statement, incorporated herein by reference.

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page D-76 of Appendix D to the Proxy Statement, incorporated herein by
reference, contains information regarding the last three years' revenues, operating profit or loss, and identifiable assets attributable to the corporate and other business segment. It also contains
the last three years' underwriting losses and premium earned for the discontinued lines and coverages segment.

Allstate's
corporate and other business segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations.


Allstate's discontinued lines and coverages segment consists of business no longer written by Allstate (including environmental, asbestos and other mass tort exposures) and certain
commercial and other business in run-off.

An
Allstate subsidiary wrote excess and surplus lines coverages from 1972 to 1985, including professional liability coverages written principally on claims-made coverage
forms. The subsidiary also wrote substantial umbrella and excess general liability coverages on an occurrence basis, including medical and other product liability coverages, for major United States
corporations. In 1985, the subsidiary was merged into Allstate Insurance Company, which assumed all of its assets and liabilities. Since the early 1980s, Allstate has experienced significant increases
in losses from policies arising out of the subsidiary's umbrella and excess general liability coverage for large corporations. Most of these losses are related to environmental damage,
asbestos-related claims or other mass tort claims. Allstate continues to be involved in coverage litigation with some of the former subsidiary's insureds.

Beginning
in the 1960s, Allstate's assumed reinsurance business unit wrote treaty and facultative reinsurance covering property and casualty policies with major United States
corporations that have since become involved in environmental, asbestos and other mass tort exposures. Allstate's assumed reinsurance business unit continues to be involved in coverage litigation and
arbitration with some of its ceding companies involving liability for these claims. In 1996, Allstate sold to SCOR Re the reinsurance liabilities it had assumed in 1985 and thereafter but retained its
pre-1985 assumed reinsurance liabilities.

In
addition, after 1986, Allstate continued to write some direct commercial policies and national accounts risks. Also in 1986, the general liability policy used by Allstate and
others in the property-liability industry for this business was amended to introduce an "absolute pollution exclusion" (which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims) and to add an asbestos
exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contained annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and policies issued after 1986 also have an annual aggregate limit as
to all coverages. Allstate's experience to date is that these policy form changes have effectively limited its exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks.

In
summary, Allstate's environmental and asbestos exposures are primarily limited to policies written in periods prior to 1986 with the preponderance of the losses emanating from
policies written in the
1970s. New environmental and asbestos claims, however, continue to be reported. Allstate has established reserves for the environmental and asbestos damage claims and for other mass tort exposures.
Mass tort exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability claims, such as those for medical devices and other products. However, there are significant inherent uncertainties in
estimating the ultimate cost of these claims. Further information regarding the foregoing is contained in "Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves" below. For information regarding
Superfund proposed legislation, see "Regulation" below.


PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE RESERVES

The following discussion of property-liability claims and claims expense reserves applies to our entire property-liability operations, encompassing both the
personal property and casualty segment and the discontinued lines and coverages segment.

We
establish property-liability loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported claims and claims incurred but
not yet reported as of the end of each accounting period. In accordance with applicable insurance laws and regulations and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), no specific claim reserves
are established until a loss occurs, including a loss from a catastrophe. Underwriting results of the two property-liability segments are significantly influenced by estimates of property-liability
claims and claims expense reserves (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page D-57 of Appendix D to the Proxy Statement incorporated herein by
reference). These reserves are an accumulation of the estimated amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the reporting date.
These reserve estimates are based on known facts and interpretations of circumstances, internal factors including Allstate's experience with similar cases, historical trends involving claim payment
patterns, loss payments, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs and product mix. In addition, the reserve estimates are also influenced by external factors including court
decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process.

The
establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, is an inherently uncertain process. The ultimate cost of a loss may vary materially from the recorded
amounts. We regularly update our reserve estimates as we learn new facts and as events unfold that may have an impact on the resolution of unsettled claims. We reflect changes in prior year reserve
estimates, which may be material, in the results of operations in the period in which changes are determined to be needed.

Establishing
net loss reserves for environmental, asbestos and other mass tort claims is subject to uncertainties that are greater than those presented by other types of claims. Among
the complications are the lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure, unresolved legal issues regarding policy
coverage, the availability and collectibility of reinsurance, and the extent and timing of any such contractual liability. The legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy
provisions and whether these losses are, or were ever intended to be, covered are complex. Courts have reached different and sometimes
inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how
policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. We believe that these issues
are not likely to be resolved in the near future. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page D-57 of Appendix D to the Proxy Statement,
incorporated herein by reference.

Reserves
for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $1.63 billion, $1.65 billion and $1.46 billion, at December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.


The
year-end 2000 gross reserves of $16.86 billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were $2.6 billion more than the reserve
balance of $14.26 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance recoverables
from third parties totaling $1.63 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting and are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting and a liability for $440 million that represents a
deposit on assumed reinsurance from the acquisition of Encompass. Additional differences are caused by the reserves of the international subsidiaries, which are not included in the combined United
States statutory statement.

As
the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 1999 developed favorably in 2000 by
$722 million, compared to favorable development of the gross reserves of $615 million. Net reserve development in 2000, 1999 and 1998 was more favorable than the gross reserve
development due to higher anticipated reinsurance cessions on reserve reestimates. For further discussion of Allstate's reinsurance programs, see "Property-Liability Reinsurance Ceded" beginning on
page D-15 of Appendix D to the Proxy Statement, incorporated herein by reference.

The
following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of
the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the
end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year
which is the result of Allstate's expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve
originally established, and indicates whether or not the original reserve was adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated
liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable. This
presentation appears for all periods in which the income recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 113 have been applied. The loss reserve development table is
cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years.

For
1990 through 1995, this loss reserve development table excludes Allstate Reinsurance Co. Limited (ARCO) claims and claims expense, due to the unavailability of loss reserve
development information for these claims on a comparable basis. ARCO was sold in 1996.


The subsequent reduction in the net reserves established since December 31, 1993 shown in the foregoing table reflects favorable severity trends that Allstate has experienced,
as more fully discussed below. The initial reserves established at the end of 1991 and 1990 had to be increased over the time frame used in the table principally due to the cumulative adverse reserve
development on environmental, asbestos and other mass tort claims, virtually all of which relates to 1984 and prior years.

Allstate
has used complex databases developed by outside experts to estimate its potential environmental losses. In addition, Allstate has its own estimation techniques for
environmental and asbestos losses. We have used a combination of these resources, along with an extensive internal review of our current claim exposures, to estimate environmental and asbestos
reserves. In addition we have analyzed our reinsurance recoverables in depth. Allstate updates its evaluations of environmental, asbestos and other mass tort reserves annually. While we believe that
the actuarial techniques and databases described above have assisted in our ability to estimate environmental, asbestos and other mass tort net loss reserves, these refinements may prove to be
inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page D-57 of Appendix D to the Proxy Statement,
incorporated herein by reference.

The
following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Development table and summarizes the effect of reserve re-estimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations
for the ten-year period ended December 31, 2000. The total of each column details the amount of reserve re-estimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the
accident years to which the re-estimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve re-estimates for the
indicated accident year(s).

Favorable calendar year reserve development in 1992 through 2000 was the result of favorable severity trends in each of the eight years, which
more than offset adverse development in the discontinued lines and coverages segment.

The
favorable severity trend during this eight-year period was primarily the result of favorable injury severity trends, as compared to our anticipated trends. The
positive nature of the injury severity trend was largely due to moderate medical cost inflation, mitigated by our loss management programs. The impacts of moderate medical cost inflation have emerged
over time as actual claim settlements validated its magnitude. In addition, while claim settlement process changes are believed to have contributed to favorable severity trends on closed claims, these
changes introduce a greater degree of variability in reserve estimates for the remaining outstanding claims at December 31, 2000. Reserve re-estimates, if any, are expected to be
adversely impacted by anticipated increases in medical cost inflation rates and physical damage repair costs. See "Forward-Looking Statements and Risk Factors Affecting Allstate" in this
Form 10-K.

REGULATION

Allstate is subject to extensive regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which it does business on a wide variety of matters including licensing and
examination, price setting, trade practices, policy forms, the nature and amount of our investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, reserve adequacy, insurer
solvency,


transactions with affiliates, the amount of dividends that we may pay, and underwriting standards. This has a substantial effect on our business, especially our personal property and casualty
business. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For discussion of statutory financial information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page
D-71 of Appendix D to the Proxy Statement, incorporated herein by reference. For discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements
beginning on page D-66 of Appendix D to the Proxy Statement, incorporated herein by reference.

Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries

—As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own,
The Allstate Corporation relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal
and interest on debt. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois. Under Illinois law, it may not pay a dividend without notifying the Illinois Department of Insurance
and providing specified financial information. Furthermore, Illinois law requires Allstate Insurance Company to notify and receive approval from the Director of the Illinois Department of Insurance
for the declaration or payment of any dividend that, together with other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months, exceeds the greater of:

•

10%
of Allstate Insurance Company's statutory surplus as of December 31 of the prior year; or

•

Allstate
Insurance Company's statutory net income for the twelve-month period ending December 31 of the prior year.

The
laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends; however, in some jurisdictions the laws
may be somewhat more restrictive.

Holding Company Regulation

—The Allstate Corporation and Allstate Insurance Company are insurance holding companies subject
to regulation throughout jurisdictions in which their insurance subsidiaries do business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of Arizona, California, Florida,
Illinois, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas. The insurance codes in these states contain similar provisions (subject to certain variations) to the effect that the
acquisition or change of "control" of a domestic insurer or of any person that controls a domestic insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In
general, a presumption of "control" arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote or possession of proxies with respect to 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic
insurer or of a person that controls a domestic insurer. In Florida, regulatory approval must be obtained prior to the acquisition of 5% or more of the voting securities of a domestic stock insurer or
of a controlling company. In addition, certain state insurance laws contain provisions that require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a
non-domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre-


acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease and desist order
with respect to the non-domestic insurer if certain conditions exist, such as undue market concentration. Thus, any transaction involving the acquisition of 10% (5% in Florida) or more of
The Allstate Corporation's common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York,
Pennsylvania and Texas and would require the pre-acquisition notification in those other states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and where the
insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of the Parent's common stock.

Price Regulation

—Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price
schedules, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In most cases, such price schedules and/or policy forms must be approved prior to use. While they vary
from state to state, the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same: a price must be adequate, not excessive, and not unfairly discriminatory.

Personal
property and casualty insurers are generally unable to effect price increases with respect to a line of coverage until sometime after the costs associated with such coverage
have increased. The speed at which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the pricing laws are administered as (i) prior
approval, (ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a price before
the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a price, but the price must be filed with the
regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them.
Approximately one half of the states, including California, Florida and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of pricing systems, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a
price subsequent to its filing.

An
insurer's ability to adjust its pricing in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its
pricing or proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an
insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a
price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly
restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.

Changes
in Allstate's claim settlement process, which we believe have contributed to favorable severity trends on closed bodily injury claims since 1995 and to a slowing of loss
payments and an increase in the number of outstanding claims, may require Allstate to actuarially


adjust loss information used in its pricing application process.

From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators and special interest groups to reduce, freeze or set prices at
levels that do not correspond with underlying costs and expenses, in our opinion. The homeowners insurance business comes under similar pressure, particularly as regulators in catastrophe prone states
struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure. We expect this kind of pressure to
persist. In addition, our use of financial stability for underwriting and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators, legislators and special interest groups in various states. The result
could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of Allstate's personal property and casualty segment. We cannot predict the impact on our results of operations, liquidity
or financial position of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing.

Shared Markets

—As a condition of its license to do business in various states, Allstate is required to participate in
mandatory shared market mechanisms or pooling arrangements (including reinsurance) that provide various lines of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase
such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these organizations, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to the results of operations.

Guaranty Funds

—Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to
prescribed limits, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Allstate's expenses related to these funds have been immaterial.

Investment Regulation

—Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require investment
portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause non-conforming investments to be
treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and, in some instances, would require divestiture. As of December 31, 2000 the investment portfolios of
our insurance subsidiaries complied with such laws and regulations in all material respects.

Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies

—Many states have laws and regulations that
limit an insurer's ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit a private passenger auto insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Furthermore, certain states
prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance
departments can refuse to approve these plans on the grounds that they could lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject
withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets.


Regulation and Legislation Affecting Consolidation in the Financial Services Industry

—A number of enacted and pending
legislative measures could lead to increased consolidation and increased competition for business and for capital in the financial services industry.

At
the federal level, these measures include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which eliminated many legal barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurers and other
financial service providers. Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Parent is a grandfathered unitary thrift holding company and consequently may engage in activities that are not financial in nature.

At
the state level, these measures include legislation to permit mutual insurance companies to convert to a hybrid structure known as a mutual holding company, thereby allowing
insurance companies owned by their policyholders to become stock insurance companies owned (through one or more intermediate holding companies) partially by their policyholders and partially by
stockholders. Also several large mutual life insurers have used or are expected to use existing state laws and regulations governing the conversion of mutual insurance companies into stock insurance
companies (demutualization).

In
addition, state insurance regulators are reexamining the regulatory framework that currently governs the U.S. insurance business. They are engaged in an effort to determine the
proper role of state insurance regulation in the U.S. financial services industry following the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. We cannot predict whether any state or federal measures will be
adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate.

Other Regulatory and Legislative Initiatives

—Deferred annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products receive
favorable policyholder taxation under current tax laws and regulations. Any legislative or regulatory changes that adversely alter this treatment are likely to negatively affect the demand for these
products. In addition, the demand for the types of life insurance products that are used in estate planning may be affected by any legislative or regulatory changes to the taxation of estates.

Environmental
pollution clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and
Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini-Superfund") govern the clean-up and restoration of waste sites by "Potentially Responsible Parties"
(PRPs). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (Environmental Clean-up Laws or ECLs) establish a mechanism to pay for clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so, and
to assign liability to PRPs. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of factors. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to
clean-up, but the exact number is unknown. To date, fewer than half of the designated Superfund sites have been cleaned up. The extent of clean-up necessary and the process of
assigning liability remains in dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured


PRPs
and insured parties' alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues
include whether Superfund response, investigation and clean-up costs are considered damages under the policies, trigger of coverage, applicability of several types of pollution exclusions,
proper notice of claims, whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend, appropriate allocation of liability among triggered insurers, and whether the liability in question falls within
the definition of an "occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on
these issues. Allstate's exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. See the discussion of Allstate's discontinued lines and coverages
segment in "Other Business Segments", above.

Superfund
reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, but none has been enacted at the date of this filing. Allstate will support Superfund reform which minimizes litigation
and other transaction costs; hastens the clean-up of waste sites without imposing new or additional taxes; addresses the elimination of strict, retroactive, and joint and several
liability; allows for the selection of cost-effective, efficient and practical remedial measures; eliminates retroactive natural resource damage awards; and encourages local input into the
clean-up process. At this time, there can be no assurance that any Superfund reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and
cost-efficient system for settlement of Superfund related claims.


OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ALLSTATE

As of December 31, 2000, Allstate had approximately 41,800 employees.

Allstate's
four business segments use shared services provided by Allstate Insurance Company and other affiliates, including human resources, investment, finance, information
technology and legal services.

Although
the insurance business generally is not seasonal, claims and claims expense for the personal property and casualty segment tend to be higher for periods of severe or
inclement weather.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AND

RISK FACTORS AFFECTING ALLSTATE

This document contains "forward-looking statements" that anticipate results based on management's plans that are subject to uncertainty. These statements are
made subject to the safe-harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Forward-looking
statements do not relate strictly to historical or current facts and may be identified by their use of words like "plans," "expects," "will," "anticipates,"
"estimates," "intends," "believes" and other words with similar meanings. These statements may address, among other things, our strategy for growth, product development, regulatory approvals, market
position, expenses, financial results and reserves. Forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations of future events. We cannot guarantee that any forward-looking statement
will be accurate. However, we believe that our forward-looking statements are


based
on reasonable, current expectations and assumptions. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.

If
the expectations or assumptions underlying our forward-looking statements prove inaccurate or if risks or uncertainties arise, actual results could differ materially from those
predicted in our forward-looking statements. In addition to the normal risks of business, Allstate is subject to significant risk factors, including those listed below.

•

The
implementation of Allstate's multi-access distribution model involves risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on Allstate's
results of operation, liquidity or financial position. For example, the direct customer sales capabilities could lead to unreliable sales activity, an unacceptable profit contribution and channel
competition.

•

We
continue to pursue expense reduction efforts, including the actions undertaken in connection with the $600 million expense reduction program
announced in November 1999. These expense reductions are dependent on the adequacy of the actions taken to eliminate certain employee positions, consolidate Allstate's operations and
facilities, and reorganize its multiple employee agency programs to a single exclusive agency independent contractor program. The savings are being partially invested in technology, competitive
pricing, The Good Hands Network and advertising.

•

There
is inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing property-liability loss reserves, particularly reserves for the cost of environmental,
asbestos and other mass tort claims. This uncertainty arises from a number of factors, including ongoing interpretation of insurance policy provisions by courts, inconsistent decisions in lawsuits
regarding coverage, and expanded theories of liability. In addition, ongoing changes in claims settlement practices can lead to changes in loss payment patterns, which are used to estimate reserve
levels. Moreover, while we believe that improved actuarial techniques and databases have assisted us in estimating environmental, asbestos and other mass tort net loss reserves, these refinements may
subsequently prove to be inadequate indicators of the extent of probable loss. Consequently, ultimate losses could materially exceed established loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our
results of operations, liquidity or financial position.

•

We
have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, catastrophe losses. We define "catastrophe" as an event that produces pre-tax
losses, before reinsurance, in excess of $1 million and that involves multiple first party policyholders or an event that produces a number of claims in excess of a pre-set, per
event, threshold of average claims in a specific area. Catastrophes are caused by various events, including earthquakes, wildfires, tornadoes, hailstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, high winds and
winter storms. While we believe that our catastrophe management initiatives (described in "PP&C Catastrophe Losses and Catastrophe Management" beginning on page D-9 of Appendix D to
the Proxy Statement) have reduced the potential magnitude of possible future losses, Allstate continues to be exposed to catastrophes that could have a material adverse impact on our results of
operations or financial position. Catastrophic events in the future may indicate that the techniques and


data
that we use to predict the probability of catastrophes and the extent of the resulting losses are inaccurate.

•

Changes
in the severity (average cost per claim) of claims have an impact on the profitability of our business. Changes in bodily injury claim severity are
driven primarily by inflation in the medical sector of the economy. Changes in auto physical damage claim severity are driven primarily by inflation in auto repair costs, auto parts prices and used
car prices. Changes in loss costs for homeowners insurance policies are driven by inflation in the construction industry, in building materials and in home furnishings. However, while inflation in
each of these sectors drives our severity, the level of inflation in any sector may not reflect our actual severity.

•

Weather
conditions including the frequency and severity of tornadoes, hailstorms, hurricanes, tropical storms, high winds, and winter storms affect the
frequency (rate of claim occurrence) and severity of claims in the personal property and casualty segment. Changing driving patterns affect the frequency and severity of claims in our private
passenger auto insurance business.

•

We
are currently pursuing various loss management initiatives in our personal property and casualty insurance business that we expect to contribute to the
reduction of claim severity in the future. However, these initiatives may not offset the impact of increased severity, which is inherently hard to predict.

•

For
our non-standard private passenger auto insurance business, we are pursuing programs to address adverse profitability trends. These
programs include changes such as additional down-payment requirements, new underwriting criteria, pricing increases, policy non-renewal (where permitted) and certain other
administrative changes. We expect these programs to have an adverse impact on written premium growth. However, they should improve profitability.

•

We
amortize the Allstate Financial segment's policy acquisition costs in proportion to gross profits over the estimated lives of the contract periods. We
periodically update the assumptions underlying the gross profits (which include estimated fees, investment margins and expense margins) to reflect our actual experience. These updates result in
adjustments to our cumulative amortization of Allstate Financial's policy acquisition costs and could have a material effect on results of operations.

•

We
believe that our reserves for life-contingent contract benefits are adequate to cover ultimate policy benefits, despite the underlying risks
and uncertainties associated with their determination when payments will not occur until well into the future. We periodically review and revise our estimates. Any difference between our current
assumptions and our future actual experience could have a material impact on our results of operations.

•

In
order to meet the anticipated cash flow requirements of our obligations to policyholders,


from
time to time we adjust the effective duration of the assets and liabilities of the Allstate Financial segment's investment portfolio. (See "Market Risk" on beginning on page D-20 of
Appendix D to the Proxy Statement.) Those adjustments may have an impact on the value of the investment portfolio and on investment income.

•

The
Allstate Financial segment distributes some of its products under agreements with other members of the financial services industry that are not
affiliated with Allstate. Termination of one or more of these agreements due to a change in control of any of these entities could have a detrimental effect on the segment's sales. This risk may be
exacerbated by the enactment of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks, securities firms, insurers and other financial
service providers.

•

Deferred
annuities and interest-sensitive life insurance products receive favorable policyholder taxation under current tax laws and regulations. Any
legislative or regulatory changes that adversely alter this treatment are likely to negatively affect the demand for these products. In addition, the demand for the types of life insurance products
that are used in estate planning may be affected by any legislative or regulatory changes to the taxation of estates.

•

The
insurance business is subject to extensive regulation—particularly at the state level. Many of these restrictions affect our ability to
operate and grow our businesses in a profitable manner. In particular, the personal property and casualty segment's implementation of SRM is subject to state regulatory review processes.

•

From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators and special interest groups to
reduce, freeze or set rates at levels that do not correspond with underlying costs, in our opinion. The homeowners insurance business faces similar pressure, particularly as regulators in catastrophe
prone states struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, our use of financial stability for underwriting
and pricing regularly comes under attack by regulators, legislators and special interest groups in various states. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the
profitability of Allstate's personal property and casualty segment. We cannot
predict the impact on our results of operations, liquidity or financial position of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding rates.

•

For
the past several years, the competitive pricing environment for private passenger auto insurance has put pressure on the personal property and casualty
segment's premium growth and profit margins. We believe that this pressure is abating. However, because Allstate's personal property and casualty segment's loss ratio compares favorably to the
industry, state regulatory authorities may resist our efforts to raise prices or to maintain them at current levels.


•

We
believe that SRM will allow us to be more competitive and to operate more profitably. However, the use of SRM in any state is subject to the regulatory
review process. Moreover, it is possible that the underwriting factors used by SRM and the tiered pricing model generated by SRM do not accurately reflect the level of loss costs that we will actually
incur as a result of the mix of business that we generate through the use of SRM.

•

A
number of enacted and pending legislative measures could lead to increased consolidation and increased competition for business and for capital in the
financial services industry.

•

At
the federal level, these measures include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which eliminated many legal barriers to affiliations among banks,
securities firms, insurers and other financial services providers. (Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, The Allstate Corporation is a grandfathered unitary thrift holding company and consequently may
engage in activities that are not financial in nature.)

•

At
the state level, these measures include legislation to permit mutual insurance companies to convert to a hybrid structure known as a mutual holding
company, thereby allowing insurance companies owned by their policyholders to become stock insurance companies owned (through one or more intermediate holding companies) partially by their
policyholders and partially by stockholders. Also several large mutual life insurers have used or are expected to use existing state laws and regulations governing the conversion of mutual insurance
companies into stock insurance companies (demutualization).

•

In
addition, state insurance regulators are reexamining the regulatory framework that currently governs the U.S. insurance business. They are engaged in an
effort to determine the proper role of state insurance regulation in the U.S. financial services industry following the enactment of the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act. We cannot predict whether any state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of the insurance business or what affect any such measures
would have on Allstate.

•

Many
states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer's ability to exit a market. For  example, certain states limit a private
passenger auto insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Furthermore, certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of insurance business from the state,
except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance departments can refuse to approve these plans on the grounds that they could lead to market
disruption. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit
unprofitable markets.

•

State
insurance regulatory authorities require insurance companies to maintain specified levels of statutory capital and surplus. In addition, competitive
pressures require Allstate's subsidiaries to maintain financial strength ratings. These restrictions affect The Allstate


Corporation's
ability to pay dividends to stockholders and use its capital in other ways.

•

There
is uncertainty involved in estimating the availability of reinsurance and the collectibility of reinsurance recoverables. This uncertainty arises
from a number of factors, including the restructuring by reinsurers of their capital structures and segregation by the industry generally of reinsurance exposure into separate legal entities with
dedicated capital.

•

The
Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant business operations of its own. Consequently, to a large extent, its ability to pay
dividends and meet its debt payment obligations is dependent on dividends from its subsidiaries, primarily Allstate Insurance Company.

•

The
Allstate Corporation has a commercial paper program with a borrowing limit of $1.0 billion to cover short-term cash needs. In
addition, it maintains two credit facilities totaling $1.55 billion as potential sources of funds to meet short-term liquidity requirements: a $1.50 billion,
five-year revolving line of credit expiring in 2001 and a $50 million, one-year revolving line of credit expiring in 2001. The total amount outstanding at any point in
time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the lines of credit is limited to $1.55 billion. The right to borrow on the five-year line of credit is
subject to the requirements that Allstate Insurance Company maintain a specified statutory surplus level and that The Allstate Corporation's debt to consolidated net worth ratio (as defined in the
credit agreement) not exceed a designated level. Our ability to meet the requirements is dependent upon our financial condition.  We expect to renew or replace the lines of credit
during 2001, before they expire. When they are renewed or replaced, our right to borrow may become subject to different requirements.

•

Changes
in market interest rates can have adverse effects on Allstate's investment portfolio, investment income, product sales and results of operations.
Increases in market interest rates have an adverse impact on the value of the investment portfolio by decreasing unrealized capital gains on fixed income securities. Declining market interest rates
could have an adverse impact on our investment income as we invest positive cash flows from operations and as we reinvest proceeds from maturing and called investments in new investments that could
yield less than the portfolio's average rate. Changes in market interest rates, as compared to rates offered on some of the Allstate Financial segment's products, could make those products less
attractive and therefore negatively affect sales or the level of surrenders on these products, or both. Fluctuating market conditions can negatively affect the balances in Allstate Financial's
separate accounts and thereby negatively affect contract charges. The adverse effects of changing market interest rates are limited to some extent by the diversity of our product offerings, by reviews
and revisions to crediting rates on certain products, and by early withdrawal surrender charges on certain products.

•

Financial
strength ratings have become an increasingly important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and, generally, may
be expected to have an effect on an insurance company's sales. On an ongoing basis, rating agencies review the


financial
performance and condition of insurers. A downgrade, while not expected, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

risk factors regarding market risk are incorporated herein by reference to the discussion of "Market Risk" beginning on page D-20 of
Appendix D to the Proxy Statement.

THE ALLSTATE CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

SCHEDULE II (CONTINUED)

CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION OF REGISTRANT

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL INFORMATION

1.  General

The financial statements of the Registrant should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the 2001
Proxy Statement of The Allstate Corporation (the "Company" or "Registrant"). The long-term debt, and short-term debt and bank
borrowings presented in Note 10 "Capital Structure" on page D-63 of the 2001 Proxy Statement are direct obligations of the Company, with the exception of the $87 million and
$61 million outstanding of Floating Rate Notes as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 respectively and $71 million outstanding of borrowings under American Heritage Life Investment
Corporation ("AHL") credit lines as of December 31, 1999.

2.  Receivable and Payable to Subsidiaries

The majority of the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper has been loaned to subsidiaries through an intercompany loan agreement and is used for
general purposes.

In
1996, the Registrant borrowed $750 million from its subsidiary trusts at a weighted-average interest rate of 7.92%. These borrowings consist of $550 million and
$200 million of debentures that mature in 2026 and 2045, respectively, and are redeemable by the Registrant in whole or in part beginning in 2001 and 2006, respectively. The maturity of the
$550 million debenture may be extended to 2045. In 1999, the Registrant assumed $107 million of 6.75% subordinated debentures in connection with the acquisition of AHL. The subordinated
debentures were issued to AHL's subsidiary trust. In August 2000, the Registrant issued 7 million shares of its common stock in exchange for settlement of its obligation
of subordinated debentures to the subsidiary trust (see Note 10 "Capital Structure" on page D-63 of the 2001 Proxy Statement). The Registrant recorded $64 million,
$60 million and $59 million of interest expense in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, related to these borrowings.

3.  Other Income and Gain on Disposition of Operations

Other income primarily represents income from the settlement of certain employee benefits of its subsidiaries, mainly profit sharing obligations. The gain on
disposition of operations in 1998 was in connection with the conversion of 6.76% Automatically Convertible Equity Securities ("ACES") into common shares of The PMI Group, Inc.

4.  Supplemental Disclosures of Non-Cash Investing Activity and Cash-Flow Information

The Registrant paid $293 million, $206 million and $178 million of interest on debt in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.

The
Registrant received dividends from subsidiaries of $789 million and $707 million in the form of fixed income securities in 1999 and 1998, respectively.

In
August 2000, the Company issued 7 million shares of its common stock in exchange for settlement of its obligation of subordinated debentures to the subsidiary trust
(see Note 10 "Capital Structure" on Page D-63 of the 2001 Proxy Statement).
